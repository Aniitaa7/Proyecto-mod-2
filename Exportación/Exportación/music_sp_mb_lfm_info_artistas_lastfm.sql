Her discography spans multiple genres, and her narrative songwriting, which is often inspired by her personal life, has received widespread media coverage and critical praise.\r\n\r\nSwift rose to mainstream prominence with her sophomore studio album, Fearless (2008), a country pop record with crossover appeal. Aided by the top-five singles “Love Story” and “You Belong with Me”, Fearless was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Swift\'s third studio album, Speak Now (2010), blended country pop with elements of rock and featured the top-ten singles “Mine” and “Back to December”. \r\n\r\nDrawing inspiration from various pop, rock, and electronic genres, Swift\'s fourth studio album Red (2012) saw her transcending her country roots. She completely moved to pop with her synth-pop fifth studio album, 1989 (2014), and expanded the electropop sound on her next two studio albums, reputation (2017) and Lover (2019), which respectively embraced urban and retro styles. The four albums spawned a string of international top-five singles, including “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together”, “I Knew You Were Trouble”, “Shake It Off”, “Blank Space”, “Bad Blood”, “Look What You Made Me Do”, “ME! (feat. Brendon Urie of Panic! at the Disco)”, “You Need to Calm Down”, and “Lover”. \r\n\r\nIn the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, Swift experimented with folk and alternative rock on her eighth and ninth studio albums, folklore and evermore (both 2020), whose lead singles “cardigan” and “willow” topped charts around the world. She also released the critically acclaimed documentaries Miss Americana and Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions that year. Swift\'s tenth studio album, Midnights (2022), marked her triumphant return to pop after two folk albums. The album set the record for biggest first day and first week ever on Spotify, spawned the hits Anti-Hero and Lavender Haze, and sold over 1.5 million copies in its first week becoming not only the biggest debut of the decade but also Swift\'s biggest debut ever. She would make history by becoming the first artist to occupy the entire top ten of the Billboard Hot 100 with tracks from Midnights. Following Midnights, Taylor Swift announced her eleventh studio album, “The Tortured Poets Department” (2024) which was released on April 19, 2024. She announced this record at 66th Annual Grammy Award Show accepting the award for Best Pop Vocal Album for her previous album, Midnights (2022) in honour of receiving her 13th Grammy.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Swift began re-recording her back catalog in November 2020 as a result of a publicized dispute with talent manager Scooter Braun and her former label Big Machine, regarding the acquisition of the masters of her back catalog. In April 2021, Swift released a re-recorded issue of her 2008 album Fearless, titled Fearless (Taylor\'s Version). It debuted at number one in the US. Swift continued releasing re-recorded versions of her back catalog in November, 2021 with the release of Red (Taylor\'s Version), a 30 track re-issue of her 2012 critical smash. The album debuted at #1 in the US, spawned the #1 hit All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor\'s Version) (From the Vault), and broke the record at the time for biggest first day for a female album on Spotify. Red (Taylor\'s Version) was a critical and commercial hit, and proved that Swift\'s ambitious, yet ongoing plan to re-record her first 6 albums was well worth it.\r\n\r\nAlong with the release of Red (Taylor\'s Version) came All Too Well: The Short Film (2021), Swift\'s filmmaking debut. The 15 minute romantic drama was based on the lyrical content from Swift\'s 2012 fan favorite “All Too Well” starring Sadie Sink and Dylan O\'Brien. It had a limited theatrical release in major cities, and Swift held special screenings of the film throughout 2022 at various film festivals. In December, 2022 Taylor announced that she would be making her feature directorial debut with Oscar-winning studio Searchlight Pictures. \r\n\r\nFollowing the release of Midnights, Swift would embark on her first tour in five years, The Eras Tour—a retrospective tour covering the entirety of her discography. During her ongoing tour, Swift would release her next two re-recorded albums, Speak Now (Taylor\'s Version) in July and 1989 (Taylor\'s Version) in October of 2023. The former of which would land Swift as the woman with the most number-one albums (12) in Billboard 200 history, surpassing Barbra Streisand. The latter was her sixth album to sell one million copies in a single week in the US, her largest album sales in a week span. “Is It Over Now? (Taylor\'s Version)”, the lead single for 1989 (Taylor\'s Version), would peak at number one on the Billboard Hot 100.\r\n\r\nAt the 66th annual GRAMMY Awards, Taylor Swift surprised viewers by announcing her eleventh studio album,  THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT. On April 19, 2024, the album was released globally, breaking records: it became the first ever to amass 1 billion Spotify streams in a week and sold 2.6 million units in its first week in the US. Swift dominated the charts, monopolizing the top 14 spots on the Billboard Hot 100 and securing the top 10 positions on Australia’s ARIA Singles Chart. The lead single, Fortnight, featuring Post Malone, quickly soared to the number-one position on the Hot 100. Additionally, just two hours after the album’s release, Swift surprised fans with a reissue titled THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT: THE ANTHOLOGY, which included 15 extra songs.\r\n\r\nSwift has released several songs for film soundtracks. She co-wrote two songs for the Hannah Montana: The Movie soundtrack— “You\'ll Always Find Your Way Back Home” and “Crazier”, and contributed two songs to the Valentine\'s Day soundtrack, including the single “Today Was a Fairytale”, which was her first number one on the Canadian Hot 100, and peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100. She also contributed two original songs to The Hunger Games soundtrack album: “Safe & Sound - from The Hunger Games Soundtrack”, co-written and recorded with The Civil Wars and T-Bone Burnett, and “Eyes Open”. “Safe & Sound” won the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media and was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. In 2013, Swift recorded “Sweeter than Fiction”, a song she wrote and produced with Jack Antonoff for the One Chance film soundtrack, which received a Best Original Song nomination at the 71st Golden Globe Awards. Swift and English singer Zayn Malik, mononymously known as Zayn, released a single together, “I Don\'t Wanna Live Forever”, for the soundtrack of the film Fifty Shades Darker (2017). She also recorded an original song called “Beautiful Ghosts”, which she wrote with Andrew Lloyd Webber for the Cats\'s soundtrack (2019). In 2020, Swift\'s documentary Miss Americana featured the song “Only the Young” which was written after the 2018 United States elections. In 2022, she released an original song titled “Carolina” for Where The Crawdads Sing (2022) inspired by the novel written by Delia Owens. \r\n\r\nWith sales of over 200 million records worldwide, Swift is a best-selling music artist. Her accolades include 14 Grammy Awards, including four Album of the Year wins, which makes Swift the artist with the most awards for that category in history, two Brit Awards (including a Global Icon award), an Emmy Award, 28 [https://guinnessworldrecords.com/]Guinness World Records, 32 American Music Awards (the most wins by an artist), and 23 Billboard Music Awards (the most wins by a woman). She ranked eighth on Billboard\'s Greatest of All Time Artists Chart (2019) and was listed on Rolling Stone\'s 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time (2015). Swift has been included in various power rankings, such as Time\'s annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world (2010, 2015 and 2019) and Forbes Celebrity 100 (placing first in 2016 and 2019). She was named Woman of the Decade (2010s) by Billboard, Artist of the Decade (2010s) by the American Music Awards, and Person of the Year (2023) by Time Magazine. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Taylor+Swift\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

She gained some significant attention with her early releases, but it was her 2019 sophomore effort, Hot Pink, that took her to the top of the Hot 100. Subsequent charting singles and collaborations with SZA and Saweetie further solidified her star power, and made the arrival of her 2021 album Planet Her all the more hotly anticipated. A number two Billboard 200 hit, Planet Her also earned several Grammy nominations. Singles followed, including her savvy 2022 cover of Hole\'s \"Celebrity Skin\" 2022\'s \"Vegas\" off the Elvis soundtrack, and 2023\'s trip-hop-inflected \"Attention\" all of which spotlighted Doja\'s adventurous, genre-crossing sensibilities. The latter track and \"Paint the Town Red\" appeared on her fourth album, 2023\'s Scarlet, which found her digging deep into her rap and hip-hop roots and became her third consecutive album to hit the Top Ten of the Billboard 200. Doja Cat was born Amala Zandile Dlamini in 1995 in Tarzana, California, the daughter of South African actor Dumisani Dlamini and painter Deborah Elizabeth Sawyer. After moving to New York for a few years, she returned to California with her mother. As a child, she studied piano and took tap, ballet, and jazz dance lessons. She also discovered surfing and breakdancing. By her teens, she was teaching herself to sing and listening to an eclectic mix of hip-hop, indie rock, R&B, and electronic music. Doja also began recording songs on her computer and in 2014 released her debut EP, Purrr! She quickly found herself with a viral hit with the track \"So High\" More singles followed, including the languid \"Nunchucks\" and \"No Police\" each one grabbing attention online. Another single, \"Mooo!\" arrived in 2018 and quickly went viral. On the heels of that success, Doja Cat issued her full-length debut album, Amala, which found her expanding upon her dreamy, meme-friendly sound with more hip-hop-, pop-, and R&B-infused tracks, including \"Candy\" and \"Roll with Us\" In 2019, she issued an expanded version of Amala that added the singles \"Juicy\" and \"Tia Tamera\" featuring Rico Nasty. Her sophomore album, Hot Pink, was quick to follow; with features from Smino, Gucci Mane, and Tyga, the 2019 LP leaned more into the sexually wry aspects of her ever-shifting persona. A Top Ten hit on the Billboard 200, the album\'s fifth single, \"Say So\" pushed her even further up the charts. After making a steady rise in the Hot 100 at the start of 2020, the multi-platinum track finally hit number one in May, boosted by a Nicki Minaj remix. After picking up a couple of American Music Awards, Doja carried the momentum from her breakout year into 2021. She began appearing alongside established celebrities more frequently, adding a guest feature to Saweetie\'s single \"Best Friend\" contributing to an Ariana Grande remix with Megan Thee Stallion, and releasing the SZA-assisted single \"Kiss Me More\" All of this led up to the June 2021 release of her third full-length studio album, Planet Her. It featured guest spots from Young Thug, The Weeknd, JID, and others, and its cover art was shot by photographer David LaChapelle. The album, which reached number two on the Billboard 200 and topped the R&B albums chart, also garnered Grammy nominations for Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album. In February 2022, Doja hit number 18 on the Hot Rock & Alternative Songs chart with a cover of Hole\'s \"Celebrity Skin\" which featured lyrics reworked by her and Courtney Love. That same year, she reached the Top Ten of the Hot 100 with \"Vegas\" her contribution to the soundtrack to director Baz Luhrmann\'s Elvis biopic. In June 2023, she debuted the \'90s trip-hop-inspired \"Attention\" as the first track released off her fourth studio album, Scarlet. Another song, \"Paint the Town Red\" followed that August as the official first single. Arriving that September, the album found Doja balancing her pop-R&B style with tracks that embraced her rap and hip-hop roots. It featured production by a handful of artists, including Earl on the Beat, D.A. Got That Dope, and Y2K, among others. A Top Five album on both the Billboard 200 and Rap Albums charts, Scarlet also earned several Grammy nominations, including Best Pop Solo Performance for \"Paint the Town Red\" and Best Rap Song for \"Attention\" <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Doja+Cat\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Drake was an actor on the teen drama television series Degrassi: The Next Generation in the early 2000s. Intent on pursuing a career in music, he left the series in 2007 after releasing his debut mixtape, Room for Improvement. He released two further independent projects, Comeback Season and So Far Gone, before signing to Lil Wayne\'s Young Money Entertainment in June 2009.\r\n\r\nDrake released his debut studio album Thank Me Later in 2010, which debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 and was soon certified platinum. His next two releases, 2011\'s Take Care and 2013\'s Nothing Was the Same, were critically and commercially successful; the former earned him his first Grammy Award for Best Rap Album. In 2015, he released two mixtapes—the trap-influenced If You\'re Reading This It\'s Too Late and collaboration with Future titled What a Time to Be Alive—both of which earned platinum certification in the U.S. His fourth album, Views (2016), broke several chart records. The dancehall-influenced album sat atop the Billboard 200 for 13 nonconsecutive weeks, becoming the first album by a male solo artist to do so in over 10 years. The album\'s second single, \"One Dance\", topped the charts in several countries, and became his first number-one single as a lead artist. That year, Drake led both the Billboard Hot 100 and the Billboard 200 charts simultaneously for eight weeks.\r\n\r\nViews achieved quadruple platinum status in the US, and earned over 1 million album-equivalent units in the first week of its release. It became Drake\'s best-selling album to date. Its lead single \"Hotline Bling\" peaked at number two on the Hot 100 and received Grammy Awards for Best Rap/Sung Performance and Best Rap Song, as well as \"One Dance\" which was proclaimed the song of the summer in 2016. In 2017, he released the \"playlist\" More Life. It became his seventh consecutive number one on the Billboard 200, and set multiple streaming records.

Drake holds several Billboard chart records. He has the most charted songs (205) among solo artists in the history of the Billboard Hot 100, the most simultaneously charted Hot 100 songs in a single week (27), the most time on the Hot 100 (431 weeks) and the most Hot 100 debuts in a week (22). He also has the most number one singles on the Hot Rap Songs, Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay and Rhythmic Charts. Drake has also won four Grammy Awards, six American Music Awards, twenty-seven Billboard Music Awards and three Juno Awards. As an entrepreneur, Drake has founded the OVO Sound record label with longtime collaborator 40 in 2012.\r\n\r\nEarly life\r\nDrake attended both Forest Hill Collegiate Institute (left) and Vaughan Road Academy (right) during high school.\r\nAubrey Drake Graham was born on October 24, 1986, in Toronto, Ontario. His father, Dennis Graham, is an African American and a practicing Catholic from Memphis, Tennessee, and worked as a drummer, performing alongside country musician Jerry Lee Lewis. Drake\'s mother, Sandra \"Sandi\" Graham (née Sher), is an Ashkenazi Jewish Canadian who worked as an English teacher and florist. His parents met after Dennis performed at Club Bluenote in Toronto, where he first interacted with Sandra, who was in attendance. He is a dual citizen of the United States and Canada. In his youth, Drake attended a Jewish day school, and formally celebrated becoming a Bar Mitzvah in a religious service.\r\n\r\nDrake\'s parents divorced when he was five years old. After the divorce, he and his mother remained in Toronto, while his father returned to Memphis, where he was incarcerated for a number of years on drug-related charges. Dennis\' limited finances and legal issues caused him to remain in the United States until Drake\'s early adulthood. Prior to his arrest, however, Dennis would travel to Toronto and bring Drake to Memphis every summer. His father later collaborated with Canadian music group Arkells on the music video for a song titled \"Drake\'s Dad\". Graham claimed in an interview that Drake\'s assertions of him being an absent father were embellishments used to sell records, which Drake vehemently denies.\r\n\r\nDrake was raised in two Toronto neighborhoods. He lived on Weston Road in the city\'s working-class west end until grade six, playing minor hockey with the Weston Red Wings. He then moved to one of the city\'s affluent neighborhoods, Forest Hill, in 2000. When asked about the move, Drake replied, \"[We had] a half of a house we could live in. The other people had the top half we had the bottom half. I lived in the basement; my mom lived on the first floor. It was not big it was not luxurious. It was what we could afford.\"\r\n\r\nHe attended Forest Hill Collegiate Institute, where he demonstrated an affinity for the arts, first acting while an active student at the school. He later attended Vaughan Road Academy in the city\'s multicultural Oakwood–Vaughan neighborhood. Due to the economic status associated with the neighborhood, Drake described the school as \"not by any means the easiest school to go to.\" Drake was often bullied in school for his racial and religious background, and upon realizing that his busy class schedule was detrimental to his burgeoning acting career, Drake dropped out of school. He later graduated in October 2012.\r\n\r\nCareer - 2001–2005: Degrassi: The Next Generation\r\nAt 15, eager to begin as an actor, a high school friend introduced Drake to his father, who was an acting agent. The agent found Drake a role on Canadian teen drama series Degrassi: The Next Generation. Drake portrayed Jimmy Brooks a basketball star who became physically disabled after a classmate shot him. When asked about his early acting career, Drake replied, \"My mother was very sick. We were very poor, like broke. The only money I had coming in was off of Canadian TV\". He would continue to appear on the show until 2007, returning for sporadic appearances until his character graduated from school. Overall, Drake appeared in a total of 145 episodes.\r\n\r\n2006–2009: Early mixtapes and So Far Gone\r\nLil Wayne, the founder of Young Money Entertainment, would sign Drake to the label in 2009.\r\nAfter becoming musically inspired by Jay Z and Clipse, Drake self-released his debut mixtape, Room for Improvement, in 2006. The mixtape featured Trey Songz and Lupe Fiasco, and included vast production from Canadian producers Boi-1da, and Frank Dukes. When asked about the mixtape, Drake described the project as \"pretty straightforward, radio friendly, [and] not much content to it.\" The mixtape was released for sale only, and confirmed to have sold over 6,000 copies. In 2007, he released his second mixtape, Comeback Season. Released from his recently founded October\'s Very Own label, it spawned the single \"Replacement Girl\", featuring Trey Songz. The song made Drake become the first ever-unsigned Canadian rapper to have his music video featured on BET, with \"Replacement Girl\" being featured on the channel\'s \"New Joint of the Day\" segment on April 30, 2007. The song also saw Drake sample \"Man of the Year\" by Brisco, Flo Rida and Lil Wayne, retaining Lil Wayne\'s verse, and adjoined his own to the song\'s earlier half. This caused Jas Prince to gift Lil Wayne the song, which prompted the rapper to invite Drake to Houston in order to join his Tha Carter III tour. Throughout the duration of the tour, Drake and Lil Wayne recorded multiple songs together, including \"Ransom\", \"Forever\", and a remix to \"Brand New\". Despite the collaborations between the duo, Drake was yet to be signed by Young Money Entertainment.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Drake released his third mixtape, So Far Gone. It was made available for free download through his OVO blog website, and featured Lil Wayne, Trey Songz, Omarion, Lloyd, and Bun B. It received over 2,000 downloads in the first 2 hours of release, finding mainstream commercial success due to the singles \"Best I Ever Had\" and \"Successful\", both gaining Gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), with the former also peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100. This prompted the mixtape\'s re-release as an EP, featuring only four songs from the original, as well as the additions of the songs \"I\'m Goin\' In\" and \"Fear\". It debuted at number six on the Billboard 200, and won the Rap Recording of the Year at the 2010 Juno Awards.\r\n\r\nDue to the success of the mixtape, Drake was the subject of a bidding war from various labels, often reported as \"one of the biggest bidding wars ever\". Despite this, Drake was rumoured to have secured a recording contract with Young Money Entertainment on June 29, 2009. This was later confirmed following a planned lawsuit from Young Money, in conjunction with Drake, against an unauthorized album titled The Girls Love Drake, which was released on iTunes under dubious means.\r\n\r\nDrake then joined the rest of the label\'s roster on the America\'s Most Wanted Tour in July 2009. However, during a performance of \"Best I Ever Had\" in Camden, New Jersey, Drake fell on stage, and tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee. He underwent surgery later that year.\r\n\r\n2010–2012: Thank Me Later and Take Care\r\nDrake planned to release his debut album, Thank Me Later, in late 2008, but the album\'s release date was postponed, first to March 2010, and then to May 25, 2010. Young Money and Universal Motown had then released a statement that the album had again been pushed back three weeks, for a June 15, 2010, release.\r\n\r\nOn March 9, 2010, Drake released the debut single \"Over\", which peaked at number fourteen on the Billboard Hot 100, as well as topping the Rap Songs chart. It also received a nomination for Best Rap Solo Performance at the 53rd Grammy Awards. His second single, \"Find Your Love\", became an even bigger success; peaking at number five on the Hot 100, and was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[76] The music video for the single was shot in Kingston, Jamaica, and was criticized by Jamaica\'s minister of tourism, Edmund Bartlett. Bartlett condemned the portrayal of the island in the video, saying, \"]Care has to be taken by all, including our creative artists, in [showcasing] images of our destination and people. Gun culture, while not unique to Jamaica, is not enhancing [the island\'s image].\" The third single and fourth singles, \"Miss Me\" and \"Fancy\" respectively, attained moderate commercial success, however, the latter garnered Drake his second nomination at the 53rd Grammy Awards, for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group. On April 29, it was reportedly announced that Drake had finished Thank Me Later during a show in Kansas City, Missouri.\r\n\r\nThank Me Later was released on June 15, 2010, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 with sales of over 447,000 copies in its first week. Upon the album\'s release, 25,000 fans gathered at New York City\'s South Street Seaport for a free concert, hosted by Drake and Hanson, which was later cancelled by police after a near-riot ensued due to overflowing crowds. The album became the top selling debut album for any artist in 2010, and featured Lil Wayne, Kanye West, and Jay Z.\r\n\r\nIt was soon announced that Drake would have a prominent role in military science fiction video game, Gears of War 3. He was scheduled to play the part of Jace Stratton, but scheduling conflicts with his upcoming Away from Home Tour prevented Drake from accepting the role. He began the tour on September 20, 2010, in Miami, Florida, performing at 78 shows over four different legs. It concluded in Las Vegas in November 2010. Due to the success of the Away from Home Tour, Drake hosted the first OVO Festival in 2010. It would soon become a regular event during the summer, with the Molson Amphitheatre in Toronto playing host to the festival on its annual cycle. Drake also had an eco-friendly college tour to support the album, beginning with Eastern Illinois University in Charleston, Illinois. It concluded in Plymouth, New Hampshire on May 8, and he had also performed at The Bamboozle on May 1.\r\n\r\nBeginning his second effort in fall 2010, Drake announced his intentions to allow for Noah \"40\" Shebib to handle most of the production and record a more cohesive sound than on Thank Me Later, which featured disparate production duties by Shebib and others. In November 2010, Drake revealed the title of his next studio album will be Take Care. In comparison to his debut album, Drake revealed to Y.C Radio 1 that Thank Me Later was a rushed album, stating, \"I didn\'t get to take the time that I wanted to on that record. I rushed many of the songs and sonically I didn\'t get to sit with the record and say, \'I should change this verse.\' Once it was done, it was done. That\'s why my new album is called Take Care, because I get to take my time this go-round.\" Drake sought to expand on the low-tempo, sensuous, and dark sonic aesthetic of Thank Me Later. Primarily a hip hop album, Drake also attempted to incorporate R&B and pop to create a languid, grandiose sound.\r\n\r\nIn January 2011, Drake was in negotiations to join Eva Green and Susan Sarandon as a member of the cast in Nicholas Jarecki\'s Arbitrage, before ultimately deciding against starring in the movie, to focus on the album. \"Dreams Money Can Buy\" and \"Marvins Room\" were released on Drake\'s October\'s Very Own Blog, on May 20 and June 9, respectively. Acting as promotional singles for Take Care, the former was eventually unincluded on the album\'s final track listing, while \"Marvins Room\" gained Gold certification by the RIAA, as well as peaking at number 21 on the Billboard Hot 100, and reaching the top 10 of the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, coupled with extensive play on contemporary urban radio. Drake would soon release the song\'s music video on June 28.\r\n\r\n\"Headlines\" was released on August 9, acting as the lead single for Take Care. It was met with positive critical and commercial response, reaching number thirteen on the Hot 100, as well as becoming his tenth single to reach the summit of the Billboard Hot Rap Songs, making Drake the artist with the most number-one singles on the chart, with 12. It was eventually certified Platinum in both the United States and Canada. The music video for the single was released on October 2, and foresaw Drake performing the song during the second intermission of the 59th National Hockey League All-Star Game in January 2012. \"Make Me Proud\" was released as the album\'s second single, on October 16. It was the final single to be released prior to the launch of the album, and debuted at number 97 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song reached number nine the following week, tying the record for the largest jump on the Billboard Hot 100 for a male artist, with 88. \"Make Me Proud\" soon became Drake\'s fourth consecutive single to receive Platinum certification by the RIAA.\r\n\r\nPrior to the album\'s release, Drake had planned to record a collaborative album with Lil Wayne, however, it was ultimately scrapped due to the success of Watch the Throne. He had also begun collaborations with Rick Ross for a mixtape titled Y.O.L.O., but the duo decided against the project, in favor of increased concern for their respective studio albums.\r\n\r\nTake Care was released on November 15, 2011, and received generally positive reviews from music critics. John McDonnell of NME dubbed it \"an affecting masterpiece\" and commended its \"delicate, mellifluous sound and unashamedly candid, emotive lyrics.\" Pitchfork\'s Ryan Dombal found Drake\'s \"technical abilities\" to be improved and stated, \"Just as his thematic concerns have become richer, so has the music backing them up.\" Andy Hutchins of The Village Voice called it \"a carefully crafted bundle of contradictory sentiments from a conflicted rapper who explores his own neuroses in as compelling a manner as anyone not named Kanye West.\" Chicago Tribune writer Greg Kot complimented the depth of Drake\'s \"moral psychodramas\" and stated, \"the best of it affirms that Drake is shaping a pop persona with staying power.\" It also won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album at the 55th Annual Grammy Awards, and achieved great commercial success, eventually being certified quadruple platinum by the RIAA in 2016, with sales for the album marking 2.6 million in the US.\r\n\r\nThe album\'s third and fourth singles, \"The Motto\" and Take Care\", were released on November 29, and February 21, 2012 respectively. Each song was subject to commercial success, while also having large societal impacts, with \"The Motto\" credited for popularizing the phrase \"YOLO\" in the United States. The music video for \"Take Care\" saw widespread acclaim, with MTV stating, \"None of his contemporaries – not even the ever-obtuse Kanye [West] - make videos like this, mostly because no one else can get away with it.\" The video received four nominations at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards, for Best Male Video, Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, and Video of the Year. The song was also featured on the channel\'s \"Pop Songs You Must Hear\" list of 2011. \"HYFR\" was the final single to be released from the album, and became certified Gold. It would later win the MTV Video Music Award for Best Hip-Hop Video in 2012, and the channel also ranked him at number two on their \"Hottest MCs in the Game\" list.\r\n\r\nIn promotion of his second album, Drake embarked on the worldwide Club Paradise Tour. It became the most successful hip-hop tour of 2012, grossing over $42 million. He then returned to acting, starring in Ice Age: Continental Drift as Ethan.\r\n\r\n2013–2015: Nothing Was the Same and commercial mixtapes\r\nDuring the European leg of the Club Paradise Tour, Drake spoke in an interview stating that he had begun working on his third studio album. Revealing his intentions to remain with 40 as the album\'s executive producer, Drake spoke fondly about Jamie xx, hoping to include and expand the British producer\'s influence over his next album. Drake had also revealed that the album would stylistically differ from Take Care, departing from the ambient production and despondent lyrics prevalent previously.\r\n\r\nIn January 2013, Drake announced that he would release the first single off of his third album at the conclusion of the 55th Annual Grammy Awards. Despite an initial delay, it was released in the wake of his win for the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album at the event, and it foresaw Drake announcing Nothing Was the Same as the title of his third album. The album\'s second single, \"Hold On, We\'re Going Home\", was released in August 2013, becoming the most successful single off of the album, peaking at number-one on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Drake sought inspiration from the 1980s television series Miami Vice during the composition of the song\'s music video, incorporating the dramatic elements seen in the show en route to winning his second MTV Video Music Award in 2014 for the video. Drake appeared on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, performing the album\'s third single, \"Too Much\", alongside featured artist Sampha.\r\n\r\nNothing Was the Same was released on September 24, 2013, debuting at number one on the US Billboard 200, with 658,000 copies sold in its first week of release. The album debuted atop the charts in Canada, Denmark, Australia and the United Kingdom. The album also enjoyed generally favorable reviews by contemporary music critics, commending the musical shift in terms of the tone and subject matter, comparing it to the distinct change showcased in 808s & Heartbreak. The album was also reported to have sold over 1,720,000 copies in the United States, and was further promoted by the \"Would You like a Tour?\" throughout late 2013, to early 2014. It became the 22nd-most successful tour of the year, grossing an estimated $46 million. Drake then returned to acting in January 2014, hosting Saturday Night Live, as well as serving as the musical guest. His versatility, acting ability and comedic timing were all praised by critics, describing it as what \"kept him afloat during the tough and murky SNL waters\". Drake also performed in Dubai, being one of the only artists ever to perform in the city. In late 2014, Drake announced that he had begun recording sessions for his fourth studio album.\r\n\r\nIn 2014, Drake performed in Spanish as a featured artist on the Romeo Santos song Odio. He also appeared on a remix of Tuesday by ILoveMakonnen, which peaked at number one on Billboard\'s Rhythmic chart and number twelve on the \"Hot 100\", and released \"0 to 100 / The Catch Up\" as a non-album single. The latter went double platinum in the United States.\r\n\r\nOn February 12, 2015, Drake released If You\'re Reading This It\'s Too Late onto iTunes, with no prior announcement. Despite debate on whether it is an album or a mixtape, its commercial stance quantifies it as his fourth retail project with Cash Money Records, a scheme that was rumored to allow Drake to leave the label. However, he eventually remained with Cash Money, and If You\'re Reading This It\'s Too Late sold over 1 million units in 2015, making Drake the first artist with a platinum project in 2015, as well as his fourth overall. Drake proceeded If You\'re Reading This It\'s Too Late with a collaborative mixtape with Future, which was recorded in Atlanta in just under a week.\r\n\r\nWhat a Time to Be Alive debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, making Drake the first hip hop artist to have two projects reach number one in the same year since 2004. It was later certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for combined sales, streaming and track-sales equivalent of over 1 million units. Drake also appeared on the cover of The Fader for their 100th issue.\r\n\r\n2016–2017: Views and More Life\r\nDrake announced in January 2016 that his fourth studio album would be launched during the spring, releasing the promotional single \"Summer Sixteen\" later that month. The album was originally titled Views from the six, but would later be shortened to Views. \"Summer Sixteen\" debuted at number six on the US Billboard Hot 100, and proved controversial, with Drake comparing his standing in hip-hop to more tenured artists. This move divided many contemporary music critics, describing his self-comparison as \"goodly brash\" or \"conventionally disrespectful.\" It was also interpreted as a diss track towards Tory Lanez, who was unhappy at Drake popularizing the term \"The Six\" when referencing Toronto. Drake also crashed a Bat Mitzvah in New York City on February 20, performing at the event.\r\n\r\nDrake soon released the album\'s lead singles, \"Pop Style\" and the dancehall-infused \"One Dance\", on April 5. Both debuted within the top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100, however, the latter proved more commercially successful, with \"One Dance\" becoming Drake\'s first number-one single in Canada and the US as a leading artist. The single also became Drake\'s first number one single as a lead artist in the United Kingdom, and peaked at number one in Germany, France, Australia, Brazil, Sweden, Belgium, Norway and the Netherlands. During an episode for OVO Sound Radio, Drake confirmed the album\'s release date of April 29, and followed it up with various promotional videos. On October 15, \"One Dance\" became Spotify\'s most-streamed song ever, amassing over 882 million plays as of October 2016.\r\n\r\n\r\nDrake performing at the Summer Sixteen Tour in Toronto in 2016.\r\nViews was previewed in London, before its premiere on Beats 1 a day later. It was released as an Apple Music and iTunes exclusive on April 29, before being made available to various other platforms later that week. Views would become Drake\'s most commercially successful album, sitting atop the Billboard 200 for ten nonconsecutive weeks, as well as simultaneously leading the Billboard Hot 100 and the Billboard 200 for eight weeks. It also achieved double-platinum status in the US, and earned over 1 million album-equivalent units in the first week of its release, as well as gaining over half-billion overall streams of the album. Despite its success, critical opinion towards the album remained much divided, drawing criticism for being overlong and lacking in a cohesive theme, while also claiming Drake was not challenging himself artistically, as opposed to his contemporaries. He would later to release a short film titled Please Forgive Me, starring frequent collaborators, Swedish twin models Elizabeth and Victoria Lejonhjärta. As of 2019, Views remains Drake\'s best-selling album.\r\n\r\nDrake returned to host Saturday Night Live on May 14, serving as the show\'s musical guest. Later, Drake was named as a member of the Forbes Five, which ranks the wealthiest artists in hip-hop, placing fifth after Birdman, Jay Z, Dr. Dre, and Diddy respectively. Drake and Future then announced the Summer Sixteen Tour to showcase their collective mixtape, as well as their respective studio albums. This marked Drake\'s third co-headlining tour, which began in Austin, Texas on July 20. On July 23, Drake announced that he was working on a new project, scheduled to be released in early 2017, and was later named as the headline act for the 2016 iHeartRadio Music Festival. The latter dates of the Summer Sixteen Tour were postponed, however, due to Drake suffering an ankle injury. During the 2016 OVO Festival, Kanye West confirmed that he and Drake had begun working on a collaborative album. Soon after, the music video for \"Child\'s Play\" was released, depicting Drake and Tyra Banks playing a couple encountering relationship issues at the Cheesecake Factory in a reference to one of the song\'s lyrics. On September 26, Please Forgive Me was released as an Apple Music exclusive. It ran a total of 25 minutes, and featured music from Views. At the 2016 BET Hip-Hop Awards, Drake received the most nominations, with 10, winning the awards for Album of the Year and Best Hip-Hop Video. Drake later announced the Boy Meets World Tour on October 10, with twenty-six dates announced for the course of the tour in Europe. Seven additional dates were added a day later due to overwhelming demands.\r\n\r\nSoon after, during an episode of OVO Sound Radio, Drake confirmed he would be releasing a project titled More Life in December, however he later pushed the date back to the new year. The project was described as a \"playlist of original music\", rather than being classified as a traditional mixtape or solo album. He was later revealed to be Spotify\'s most streamed artist for the second consecutive year in 2016, amassing a total 4.7 billion streams for all projects on the service, which is more than double the amount of streams he had in 2015. Drake later secured his second and third Grammy Awards, winning for Best Rap/Sung Performance and Best Rap Song at the 59th ceremony. Despite multiple setbacks, Drake announced More Life would be released on March 18, 2017, via a series of multiple video commercials released through Instagram. Upon release, More Life received mostly positive reviews, and debuted atop the Billboard 200, earning 505,000 album-equivalent units in its first week. It also set a streaming record, becoming the highest ever streamed album in 24 hours, with a total of 89.9 million streams on Apple Music alone. The album also garnered 61.3 million streams on Spotify, dethroning Ed Sheeran\'s ÷ as the highest opening on the service in a single day. He later won 13 awards at the 2017 Billboard Music Awards in May, which saw him breaking the record for the most wins in a single show. Billboard also reported Drake had been present on the Hot 100 chart for eight consecutive years, and has the most recorded entries by a solo artist.\r\n\r\nHe then released the single \"Signs\" on June 24, as well as reuniting with Metro Boomin on a single with Offset. The singles marked his first releases since More Life, with \"Signs\" was initially released as a collaboration between Drake and French fashion house Louis Vuitton, as part of the \"Louis Vuitton Men’s Spring-Summer 2018\" fashion show. The event also had a playlist exclusively from OVO Sound, curated by label co-founder Oliver El-Khatib. Drake later hosted the first annual NBA Awards on June 26, and starred in multiple commercials alongside his father in promotion of Virginia Black. Drake then appeared in The Carter Effect documentary, honouring the basketball career of Vince Carter, who was the first superstar player to appear for the Toronto Raptors since the franchise\'s inception in 1995. The documentary also featured NBA players Chris Bosh, Tracy McGrady, Steve Nash, and LeBron James.\r\n\r\n2018: Scorpion and return to television\r\nAfter rumours circulated of Drake possibly collaborating with various artists, including rapper Trippie Redd and producer Pi\'erre Bourne, for his new studio album, multiple snippets of songs were leaked near the closing end of 2017. Two songs would later be released as members of a mini EP, titled Scary Hours, on January 20, 2018, marking Drake\'s first solo release since More Life, as well as his first appearance on any song after featuring on a remix of the Jay-Z song \"Family Feud\" with Lil Wayne, as the lead single of the latter\'s Dedication 6: Reloaded mixtape. Scary Hours featured the songs \"Diplomatic Immunity\" and \"God\'s Plan\", which both debuted within the top-ten, with the latter eventually breaking various streaming records as it debuted at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100. The song was Drake\'s second as a solo artist to reach number one.\r\n\r\nDrake earned his 70th top 40 hit after featuring on the Migos song \"Walk It Talk It\", which debuted at number eighteen, and peaked at number ten. He later featured on BlocBoy JB\'s debut single, \"Look Alive\", which was released on February 9, 2018. The song\'s entry at number six on the Hot 100 made Drake the rapper with the top 10 hits on the Hot 100, with 23. He then featured on a remix to \"Lemon\", a song originally released as collaboration between band N.E.R.D and Rihanna. On April 5, Drake announced he was finishing his fifth studio album and he was releasing a single later that night. On April 6, \"Nice for What\" was released, alongside a music video, which featured several female celebrities.\r\n\r\nAfter \"Nice For What\" replaced his own \"God\'s Plan\" on the Billboard Hot 100 at number one, making him the first artist to have a new number-one debut replace their former number-one debut, Drake announced the title of his fifth studio album as Scorpion, with a planned release date of June 29, 2018. He then released \"I\'m Upset\" on May 26, as the album\'s third single. Scorpion was then released as a double-album, and marked Drake\'s longest project, with a run-time of just under 90 minutes. The album broke both the one-day global records on Spotify and Apple Music, as it gained 132.45 million and 170 million plays on each streaming service, respectively. It eventually sold 749,000 album equivalent units in its first week of sales, and debuted at number one on the Billboard 200.\r\n\r\nShortly thereafter, Drake collaborated with British hip hop promotion Link Up TV on July 7, releasing a freestyle as a part of the promotion\'s \'Behind Barz\' segment, before releasing another freestyle a week later after featuring on Charlie Sloth\'s long-running Fire in the Booth program on BBC Radio 1Xtra. Drake then earned his sixth number-one hit with \"In My Feelings\" on July 21, which also spawned the viral \"#InMyFeelingsChallenge\" or \"#KiKiChallenge\". The success of \"In My Feelings\" also made Drake the record holder for most number one hits among rappers. Soon after, he released the music video for \"Nonstop\", which was filmed in London during his surprise performance at the Wireless Festival.\r\n\r\nHe then appeared on the album Astroworld, featuring uncredited vocals for the song \"Sicko Mode\", which peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100. Drake announced in July 2018 that he planned to \"take 6 months to a year\" to himself in order to produce television and films, including Euphoria. He then began the Aubrey & the Three Migos Tour with co-headliners Migos on August 12. This preceded collaboration with Bad Bunny titled \"Mia\", which featured Drake performing in Spanish. He later received the award for Hot Ticket Performer at the 2018 BET Hip Hop Awards on October 16. During a performance in Edmonton on November 7, Drake announced his intention to begin composing his next project in early 2019.\r\n\r\n2019–present: Upcoming album\r\nIn February 2019, he received his fourth Grammy Award for Best Rap Song, for \"God\'s Plan\", at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards. During his speech, producers abruptly cut to a commercial break, leading viewers to speculate they were censoring his speech during which he criticized The Recording Academy. A legal representative for the Academy then released a statement stating \"a natural pause [led] the producers [to] assume that he was done and cut to commercial,\" and added the organization offered him an opportunity to return to stage, but he declined.\r\n\r\nOn February 14, Drake re-released his third mixtape, So Far Gone, onto streaming services for the first time to commemorate its 10-year anniversary, and later collaborated with Summer Walker on a remix of Walker\'s song \"Girls Need Love\", marking his first release of 2019. On April 10, 2019 during a London performance on his Assassination Vacation Tour, the OVO leader told the crowd he was working on his new album before the show. On June 8, Drake appeared on Chris Brown\'s single \"No Guidance\". On June 15, Drake released two songs, \"Omertà\" and \"Money in the Grave\", on his EP The Best in the World Pack to celebrate the NBA Championship win of the Toronto Raptors. On August 2, he released the compilation album Care Package, consisting of songs released between 2010 and 2016 that were initially unavailable for purchase or commercial streaming; it debuted at number one.\r\n\r\nArtistry - influences\r\nDrake has cited several hip hop artists as influencing his rapping style, including Kanye West, Jay Z, and Lil Wayne, while also attributing various R&B artists as influential to the incorporation of the genre into his own music, including Aaliyah, and Usher. Drake has also credited several dancehall artists for later influencing his Caribbean-inflected style, including Vybz Kartel, whom he has called one of his \"biggest inspirations\".\r\n\r\nMusical style\r\nDrake has credited Kanye West (left) and Aaliyah (right) as being his biggest musical influences. Drake is known for his egotistical lyrics, technical ability, and integration of personal backstory when dealing with relationships with women. His vocal abilities have been lauded for an audible contrast between typical hip-hop beats and melody, with sometimes abrasive rapping coupled with softer accents, delivered on technical lyricism. His songs often include audible changes in lyrical pronunciation in parallel with his upbringing in Toronto, and connections with Caribbean and Middle Eastern countries which include such phrases as \"ting\", \"touching road\", \"talkin\' boasy\" and \"gwanin\' wassy\". Most of his songs contain R&B and Canadian hip-hop elements, and he combines rapping with singing. He credits his father with the introduction of singing into his rap mixtapes, which have become a staple in his musical repertoire. His incorporation of melody into technically complex lyrics was supported by Lil Wayne, and has subsequently been a critically acclaimed component to Drake\'s singles and albums.\r\n\r\nThe lyrical content that Drake deploys is typically considered to be emotional or boastful. However, Drake is often revered for incorporating \"degrading\" themes of money, drug use, and women into newer, idealized contexts, often achieving this through his augmentation of the typical meaning of phrases in which he combines an objective and subjective perspective into one vocal delivery. His songs often maintain tension between \"pause and pace, tone timbre, and volume and vocal fermata.\" Drake is credited with innovating what has been referred to as \"hyper-reality rap\", which is characterized by its focus on themes of celebrity as being distinct from the \"real world.\"\r\n\r\nPublic image\r\nThe Washington Post editor Maura Judkis credits Drake for popularizing the phrase \"YOLO\" in the United States, with his single, \"The Motto\", which includes, \"You only live once: that\'s the motto, nigga, YOLO.\" Drake later popularized the term \"The Six\" in 2015 in relation his hometown Toronto, subsequently becoming a point of reference to the city. Furthermore, the subject matter of his artistry often revolving around relationships, have had widespread impact on social media through photo captions commonly used to reference emotions or personal situations. However, his lyrical contents have had a negative reception from fans and critics deeming him as sensitive; a trait that is understood as being antithetical to hip hop culture. June 10 was declared \"Drake Day\" in Houston, Texas. In 2016, Drake visited Drake University after a show in Des Moines, in response to an extensive social media campaign by students that began in 2009, advocating for his appearance. In 2016, Drake spoke on the shooting of Alton Sterling, publishing an open letter expressing his concern for the safety of ethnic minorities against police brutality in the United States. He would also donate $200,000 in order to aid relief efforts in Houston as a result of Hurricane Harvey. In February 2018, following the single \"God\'s Plan\" debut at no. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, Drake donated $50,000 to a Miami homeless shelter and giving a University of Miami student $50,000 to help with her tuition. Drake then \"kept up the spending spree\" by donating the rest of the song\'s video budget, $996,631.90, to several charitable causes and regular people across Miami.\r\n\r\nThe music video for \"Hotline Bling\" went viral, due to Drake\'s eccentric choices in dancing. The video has been remixed, memed, and was heavily commented on due to Drake\'s unconventional nature on the song, causing it to gain popularity on YouTube, spawning several parodies. Drake has also been critiqued for his expensive, product placement-heavy attire, exampled by the video for \"Hotline Bling\". Drake modelled a $1,500 Moncler Puffer Jacket, a $400 Acne Studios turtleneck, and limited edition Timberland 6\" Classic Boots. This foresaw collaborations between OVO and Canada Goose, in which various items of clothing were produced. Drake had also released his own collection of Air Jordans, dubbed the \"Air Jordan OVOs\". Moreover, his style and dress sense have caused GQ magazine to describe him as \"[one of] the most stylish men alive\".\r\n\r\nControversies - legal issues\r\nIn 2012, singer Ericka Lee filed a lawsuit against Drake for the usage of her voice on \"Marvins Room\". Claiming to have provided the female vocals, Lee also alleged she was owed songwriting credits and royalties. Despite Drake\'s legal team countering by claiming that Lee simply requested a credit in the liner notes of the album, the matter was resolved in February 2013, with both parties agreeing to an out-of-court settlement. In 2014, Drake was sued for $300,000 for sampling \"Jimmy Smith Rap\", a 1982 single by jazz musician, Jimmy Smith. The suit was filed by Smith\'s estate, who stated Drake never asked for permission when sampling it for the intro on \"Pound Cake / Paris Morton Music 2\", claiming Smith himself would have disagreed as he disliked hip hop. Drake would win the lawsuit in 2017, with federal judge William Pauley ruling the content used was transformative, and there was no liability for copyright infringement. Also in 2014, it emerged that Drake was sued by rapper Rappin\' 4-Tay, claiming Drake misused his lyrics on when collaborating with YG on the song \"Who Do You Love?\". He sought $100,000 for mistreatment and artistic theft, which Drake paid to the rapper later that year. In 2016, Drake caused a nightclub in Oklahoma City to close down, due to his usage of marijuana and other illegal drugs being prevalent at the club.\r\n\r\nIn 2017, Drake was embroiled in another lawsuit, being sued by producer Detail (Noel Fisher) over an alleged assault in 2014. Fisher claimed Drake\'s bodyguard, Nessel \"Chubbs\" Beezer, punched him in the face and allegedly broke his jaw over musical and financial disputes. Fisher also says the injuries caused him to be hospitalized for days and had to undergo several surgeries, following which he sued for damages related to medical bills and physical and emotional suffering. The case, which was set to undergo trial in May 2018, was eventually dismissed by Superior Court Judge Elaine Lu, after Fisher failed to show up for a final status conference; the judge ruled that Beezer solely acted in self-defense.\r\n\r\nFeuds\r\nDrake and Chris Brown were allegedly involved in a physical altercation in June 2012, when Drake and his entourage threw glass bottles at Brown in a SoHo nightclub in Manhattan, New York City. Chris Brown tweeted about the incident and released a song criticizing Drake weeks later. Despite no response from Drake, he and Brown both appeared in a comedic skit for the 2014 ESPY Awards, and rehearsed the skit together prior to the televised airing, virtually ending the dispute.\r\n\r\nIn December 2014, Drake was involved in another altercation, being punched by Diddy outside the LIV nightclub in Miami, Florida. The altercation was reported to be over Drake\'s usage of the instrumental for \"0 to 100 / The Catch Up\", allegedly produced by Boi-1da for Diddy, before Drake appropriated the track for his own use. Drake was later rushed to the ER after aggravating an old arm injury during the dispute. Drake was also involved in a feud with Tyga, stemming from Tyga\'s negative comments towards him during an interview with Vibe magazine. Drake would later respond on \"6 God\" and \"6PM in New York\", which has been interpreted as directly involved in Tyga\'s abrupt removal from Young Money Entertainment.\r\n\r\nFurther controversy arose in July 2015, when it was alleged by Meek Mill that Drake had used ghostwriters during recording sessions for \"RICO\", one of the lead singles off of Mill\'s second studio album. This proceeded further allegations that Drake did not help in promotion of the album, due to Mill discovering the ghostwriter, widely believed to be Quentin Miller. Despite Miller collaborating with Drake and receiving past credits, Mill assured that Miller had written Drake\'s verse for \"R.I.C.O.\". Soon after, Funkmaster Flex aired reference tracks in support of Mill\'s claims, notably for \"R.I.C.O.\", \"10 Bands\", and \"Know Yourself\". This prompted Drake to respond with two diss tracks, titled \"Charged Up\" and \"Back to Back\", in the space of four days. Mill would later respond with \"Wanna Know\", before removing it from SoundCloud weeks later. Despite subliminal disses from either artist, the feud has not been officially reignited. Drake would further seek to denounce Funkmaster Flex during his Madison Square Garden shows on the Summer Sixteen Tour. Following Meek Mill\'s sentencing of two to four years for probation violation, Drake stated \"Free Meek Mill\" at a concert in Australia, and ended their rivalry on \"Family Feud\". Pusha T would also use the same rationale to criticize Drake on \"Infrared\" in 2018, prompting Drake to respond with the \"Duppy Freestyle\" diss track on May 25. Pusha T would directly respond to the track through \"The Story of Adidon\" on May 29, which presented several claims, including an accusation of Drake fathering a secret child. The pair is considered to have been in a rivalry since 2012, with Drake yet to respond to \"The Story of Adidon\".\r\n\r\nIn 2016, Drake was embroiled in a feud with Joe Budden, stemming from Budden\'s derogatory comments when reviewing Views. Drake would allegedly respond to Budden through \"4PM in Calabasas\", prompting Budden to respond with two diss tracks in the space of five days, echoing the same sentiment Drake deployed during his feud with Meek Mill. Drake would later appear on \"No Shopping\" alongside French Montana, directly referencing Budden throughout the song. However, French Montana claimed that Drake\'s verse was recorded before the release of Budden\'s diss tracks. Despite Budden releasing two further songs in reference to Drake, he has yet to officially respond to Budden. In the same year, Drake mocked Kid Cudi for his mental health, drug use and suicidal urges on \"Two Birds, One Stone\" after Cudi launched an expletive-filled rant on the artist on Twitter. Cudi later checked into a rehabilitation facility following the release of the song, and continued to disparage Drake in further tweets.\r\n\r\nIn mid-2018, Drake was embroiled in a feud with long-time collaborator, Kanye West. In an appearance on the talk show The Shop in October, Drake recounted several business meetings with West, who voiced his desire to \"be Quincy Jones\" and work with him, in order to replicate the producer-artist relationship between Jones and Michael Jackson. West requested Drake play and inform him of upcoming releases, which was agreed to as Drake \"felt a genuine vibe\" from West, and after West gifted him the beat to \"Lift Yourself\", which inspired Drake to begin writing to the instrumental. West then requested Drake to travel to Wyoming to continue working, and arrived a day after close friend 40. 40 said West was working on an album; contradictory to his previous aim of just wanting to \"give [Drake] beats\". Drake responded by saying West stated he would release in late 2018, and they should continue on. However, upon his arrival in Wyoming, Drake \"[spent] the majority of time working on [West\'s] music\", only exploring his own after playing the producer the song \"March 14\", which addresses Drake\'s relationship with his newborn son and co-parent. This prompted a conversation with West regarding his personal issues, after which, news of his son would be exposed by Pusha T. West would also release \"Lift Yourself\", and produce \"Infrared\"; actions that greatly displeased Drake. This prompted him to denounce West in several songs and live performances. West would retaliate in a series of tweets in late 2018.\r\n\r\nDrake has purported to have been in reported feuds with DMX, Kendrick Lamar, Common, The Weeknd, XXXTentacion, Jay-Z, Tory Lanez, and Ludacris, although the latter three have been reported to be resolved.\r\n\r\nBusiness ventures - Endorsements\r\nPrior to venturing into business, Drake garnered several endorsement deals with various companies, notably gaining one with Sprite following his mention of drinking purple drank, a concoction that contains Sprite as a key ingredient. In the aftermath of his highly publicized feud with Meek Mill, Drake was also endorsed by fast food restaurants Burger King and Whataburger. Business magazine Forbes commented his endorsement deals and business partnerships \"combined heavily\" for Drake\'s reported pre-tax earnings at $94 million between June 2016 to June 2017, being one of the highest-paid celebrities during that period.\r\n\r\nMain article: OVO Sound\r\nDuring the composition of Nothing Was the Same, Drake started his own record label in late 2012 with producer Noah \"40\" Shebib, and business partner, Oliver El-Khatib. Drake sought for an avenue to release his own music, as well helping in the nurturing of other artists, while Shebib and El-Khatib yearned to start a label with a distinct sound, prompting the trio to team up to form OVO Sound. The name is an abbreviation derived from the October\'s Very Own moniker Drake used to publish his earlier projects. Warner Bros. Records currently distribute the label.\r\n\r\nDrake, 40 and PartyNextDoor were the label\'s inaugural artists. The label houses artists including Drake, PartyNextDoor, Majid Jordan, OB O\'Brien, Roy Woods, dvsn, Plaza, and Kash Doll, as well as producers including 40, Boi-1da, T-Minus, Mike Zombie, Nineteen85, and Future the Prince. OVO Sound has released six albums, with two certified platinum or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\r\n\r\nToronto Raptors\r\nOn September 30, 2013, at a press conference with Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment CEO Tim Leiweke, Drake was announced as the new \"global ambassador\" for the Toronto Raptors, thereby joining the executive committee of the NBA franchise, in conjunction with the announcement of the 2016 NBA All-Star Game being awarded to the Air Canada Centre in Toronto. This would also be the setting where Drake was given The Key to the City. In the role, it was announced that Drake would help to promote and serve as a host of festivities, beginning with the All-Star Game. He would also provide consulting services to rebrand the team, helping to redesign its image and clothing line in commemoration of the franchise\'s 20th anniversary. He began by hosting an annual \"Drake Night\" segment with the organization, which began in 2013.\r\n\r\nApple Music\r\nFollowing the launch of Apple Music, a music and video streaming service developed by Apple Inc., the company announced Drake as the figurehead for the platform at their Worldwide Developers Conference in 2015, with the artist also penning an exclusivity deal with the service worth a reported $19 million. This saw all future solo releases by Drake becoming available first on Apple Music, before seeing roll out to other streaming services and music retailers. Drake had also developed the OVO Sound Radio station on Beats 1, which is utilized as the primary avenue for debuting singles and projects, with the station overseeing over 300 million unique users when it debuted More Life. Drake\'s partnership with Apple Music has largely been credited for the platform\'s sharp success, as it attained 10 million subscribers after six months, as well as giving birth to exclusivity from artists, with many independent and signed artists, such as Frank Ocean and The Weeknd, also brokering exclusivity deals with streaming services. Through signing with the company, Drake was one of the artists, alongside Pharrell and Katy Perry, to exclusively own an Apple Watch before the smartwatch saw public release.\r\n\r\nVirginia Black\r\nTwo months prior to the release of Views, Drake announced the development of Virginia Black, a bourbon-based whiskey. This would be his second foray into selling foodstuffs, previously partnering with celebrity chef Susur Lee to open Fring\'s Restaurant in Toronto. The beverage was created and also distributed alongside Proximo Spirits, as well as with Brent Hocking, a spirits producer who founded DeLeón Tequila in 2008. The company described the partnership as \"fruitful [as they] share a passion for style, music, and the pursuit of taste [on] a quest to redefine whiskey.\"\r\n\r\nThe product was launched in June 2016, and contained two, three and four-year old Bourbon whiskies. The company sold over 4,000 bottles in the first week domestically. The brand was also promoted and marketed through Drake\'s music and various tours, such as being part of the \"Virginia Black VIP Lounge\" additional package available for purchase during the Summer Sixteen Tour. Virginia Black shipped a further 30,000 units when rollout was extended to select international markets in late 2016. The company later aired commercials with Dennis Graham, which featured the tagline of \"The Realest Dude Ever\" (in reference toward \"The Most Interesting Man in the World\" tagline employed by Dos Equis) after extending the sale of the drink to various European countries in 2017.\r\n\r\nPersonal life\r\nDrake lives in Hidden Hills, California, since 2012. He also owns a property in Toronto, which was built from the ground-up in 2017, and a Toronto condo adjacent to the CN Tower. He owns a Boeing 767 airplane.\r\n\r\nDrake\'s paternal uncles are bass guitarist Larry Graham and musician Teenie Hodges. Graham achieved both critical and commercial success as a member of the band Sly and the Family Stone, while Hodges featured as the lead guitarist and songwriter for Al Green, and contributed heavily on much of his work in the 1970s, including the hits \"Take Me to the River\", \"Love and Happiness\", and \"Here I Am (Come and Take Me)\".\r\n\r\nDrake is a father to one son named Adonis, who was born on October 11, 2017, to French artist Sophie Brussaux. Brussaux\'s pregnancy was the subject of several rumors after featuring in a TMZ article in early 2017; Drake eventually confirmed his fatherhood on the album Scorpion in 2018.\r\n\r\nDrake dated singer Rihanna off-and-on from 2009 to 2016. He has mentioned the relationship in every one of his studio albums, and when presenting Rihanna with the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award in 2016, he said \"she\'s a woman I\'ve been in love with since I was 22 years old.\" On becoming a single parent, he mused on the talk show The Shop:\r\n\r\nAs life takes shape and teaches you your own lessons, I end up in this situation where I don\'t have the fairy tale, like, \'Oh, Drake started a family with Rihanna and this is like so perfect.\' It looks so good on paper. By the way, I wanted that too at one time.\r\n\r\nOther artists\r\nThere are several other artists that have performed under the name Drake:\r\n1) heavy metal act\r\n2) Jason Drake\r\n3) 60s garage rock\r\n4) Polish sea folk band\r\n5) character from the film “The Pebble and the Penguin” <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Drake\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Musically, we look for songs that reach beyond our eardrums, touching our hearts. Cody Johnson\'s unique blend of country and rock does just that.\r\n\r\nMany Texan music fans met Cody Johnson’s honest style through the radio singles from his \"Six Strings, One Dream\" album: \"Nobody to Blame\" (#6 on the Texas music charts in 2009);  #1\"Pray for Rain\" (2009 - 2010); and \"Texas Kind of Way\" (#6, late 2010 – 2011). \r\n\r\nAt first he opened for other artists, but Cody has also taken the Texas dance-halls by storm. Increasingly, the Cody Johnson Band is the attraction, and an honest-to-goodness one.\r\n\r\nCody’s childhood, though, was different from his rowdy onstage personality. Growing up, home was Sebastopol, a speck on the East Texas piney woods map, the perfect setting for that country boy to roam the woods, hunt, and fish. Home-schooling and family times around the piano provided the kind of life the kind many folks envy. Even Cody\'s music training started when dad Carl taught him the chords to “I’ll Fly Away,” a  southern gospel favorite.\r\n\r\nStarting public school as a freshman, Cody expanded beyond playing the guitar and drums at church. When his AG science teacher overheard Cody playing an original song, he convinced Cody to form a band with other FFA (Future Farmers of America) members. A few months later, Cody\'s band placed runner-up in the highly-competitive Texas State FFA talent contest. \r\n\r\nCody left the contest realizing he was in love for life: in love with the music, the crowd, and the energy of performing onstage. Beginning in small honky-tonks and bars, he tried different musical styles. Discarding many, today Cody\'s shows still keep a Garth Brooks-level of energy and a Ronnie Van Zant-outlaw dedication to individual style. Like the late Chris LeDoux\'s musical beginnings, “CoJo” sold his acoustic CDs from the back of his truck during three years of bull-riding. Cody still shows up today as the true cowboy he is.\r\n\r\nAfter graduation, Johnson worked for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice in Huntsville. There, supervising prison inmates, Cody confides, \"I developed an even greater appreciation for family and friends. Seeing how easy it was to go to prison set me on the \'straight and narrow.\'\" \r\n\r\nAlso in Huntsville, Cody met Nathan Reedy, who became his new drummer. With Carl Johnson playing bass, the trio began traveling as the Cody Johnson Band. Their first CD, \"Black & White Label,\" provided funding for travel and radio promotion—and the assurance that the music dream was real.\r\n\r\nAlong the way, several popular artists have shared their friendship, fans, and wisdom with Cody. Some gave business advice and warned him of issues musicians face on the road. The common thread is that other professionals respect Cody as a performer, songwriter, and individual. In turn, Cody Johnson earns that respect, giving as much effort to an audience of 30 or 30,000. As he states, “I like the crowd to sing along, yell, or whatever makes them feel part of the show. I love big crowds because of the energy and showmanship I can exhibit. I love acoustic shows because of the intimacy and how candid they are. Acoustic shows are like sittin’ around the living room pickin\' and grinnin\'.\"\r\n\r\nWinning the Texas’ Regional Music Awards as “New Male Vocalist of the Year 2011” caused Cody to choose whether leave the security of state employment to chase his dreams. He followed his own advice to \"Always pray for direction, and know that no matter what... the good Lord has a plan.\"\r\n\r\nThe answer to that prayer came when Cody\'s wife Brandi gave her “thumbs-up.” As Cody puts it, \"When the woman I love—and plan to spend the rest of my life with—told me that she \'stands by her man\' and believes in me 100%, I believed even more confidently that I could live my dream. Though I\'ve had lots of people believe, contribute, push and pull me along, no one\'s efforts affected my decision emotionally the way Brandi\'s faith in me did.\"\r\n\r\nCody indeed left his \"day job\" for the more-than-full-time music career. But, that’s where the story really begins.\r\nExpanding his boundaries beyond Texas, he flew to Nashville to record a new CD with Nashville studio musicians hand-picked by his \"big brother,\" Nashville-based fellow Texan, Trent Willmon, producer of the new album, A Different Day (released October 31, 2011). \r\nThough new to Nashville recording ways, Johnson’s musical confidence showed in the Music City recording studio. Together, he and the studio musicians tweaked songs to obtain the exact intended effect. Listening to the Music City veterans, Cody adopted suggestions when they felt right, and would \"hang tough\" when he felt the music differently.\r\n\r\nAccording to CoJo, \"I don\'t want to be labeled as \'Texas\' or \'Nashville.\' I am me: Texas, outlaw, cowboy, country, and a God-fearing man using the gift He gave me.\"\r\n\r\n- Billie Willmon Jenkin <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Cody+Johnson\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was during this time that he adopted the name Del Water Gap, inspired by the sight of it handwritten on the back of a box truck. Initially, Jaffe played drums in a noise rock band, where he had limited opportunities to showcase his vocals. Seeking further education in music and sound production, he pursued studies at the Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music at NYU.\r\n\r\nWhile Del Water Gap was originally a band, it eventually transitioned into Jaffe\'s solo project. The lineup underwent changes during his college years, including a collaboration with singer-songwriter Maggie Rogers, who was involved for a six-month period. Jaffe and Rogers initially connected during their freshman year of college, and they released the song \"New Song,\" recorded in 2014. Collaborations have played a significant role in Jaffe\'s career, as he also worked with Claud on the single \"My Body\" and co-wrote and produced Claud\'s \"Never Meant To Call.\"\r\n\r\nIn 2018, Jaffe signed with Terrible Records and released the single \"Laid Down My Arms.\" This was followed by the release of the singles \"Chastain\" and \"Theory of Emotion\" as a lead-up to his third EP, \"Don\'t Get Dark,\" also under Terrible Records.\r\n\r\nDel Water Gap signed with Atlantic Records in 2020, and subsequently released the tracks \"Ode to a Conversation Stuck in Your Throat\" and \"Mariposa.\" The song \"Ode to a Conversation Stuck in Your Throat\" gained significant attention when actresses Margaret Qualley and Kaitlyn Dever shared an Instagram video of themselves participating in a \"socially distant dance party\" to the song during the initial summer of the COVID-19 pandemic.\r\n\r\nIn 2021, Del Water Gap joined Mom + Pop Music, releasing the single \"Hurting Kind\" along with a music video co-directed by Charlie Plummer.

Kara\'s Flowers signed to Reprise Records and released an album, \"The Fourth World\", in 1997. After a tepid response to the album, the band parted ways with the record label and the members attended college. Dusick and Madden stayed local at UCLA, while Levine and Carmichael relocated to the east coast to attend Five Towns College. While Levine and Carmichael were in New York, they began to take notice of the urban music surrounding them and later let the style influence the songs they wrote.\r\n\r\nIn 2001, the band regrouped, with guitarist James Valentine added to the line-up, and pursued a new direction under the name: Maroon 5. At this point, Jesse Carmichael switched to playing the keyboards and this has become his main instrument in the band (although he also plays rhythm guitar to this day). After these changes, Maroon 5 signed with Octone Records and released their debut album, \"Songs About Jane\", in June 2002.

However, his estranged former producer Jeremy Rose claims the name was his idea. The letter E was excluded to avoid trademark problems with the Canadian band The Weekend.\r\n\r\nThe Weeknd gained widespread critical acclaim for his three mixtapes: House of Balloons, Thursday, and Echoes of Silence, which he later compiled to make a remastered, three-disc album titled Trilogy after signing his record deal with Republic. In 2013, he released Kiss Land, which was considered to be his debut studio album.\r\n\r\nIn 2014, he dropped “Often,” a remix of Beyonce’s “Drunk In Love,” and “King of the Fall.” The Weeknd released two songs in collaboration with the film Fifty Shades of Grey, with Earned It becoming his solo breakout hit.\r\n\r\nHis second studio album became highly-anticipated, with riveting singles like  The Hills and Can’t Feel My Face leaving fans hungry for more.

The Daft Punk-assisted title track led the project as its first official single, released on Wednesday, September 21, 2016, before becoming his third number one track in the United States, as also his home country, Canada. The effort was a commercial success, topping the Billboard 200 albums chart with over 348,000 copies sold in its first week, all eighteen tracks debuting on the Billboard Hot 100, receiving a GRAMMY Award for the Best Urban Contemporary Album, category at the 60th annual ceremony, overall for the second time in his music career and being ranked as the third most popular album of 2017 in the U.S.\r\n\r\nNext came the My Dear Melancholy EP, released on March 30, 2018 and revolving around his breakups with Bella Hadid during summer of 2016 and Selena Gomez in October 2017.

The title track and In Your Eyes were also released as singles.\r\n\r\nAlthough widely expected to receive multiple nominations for After Hours, Tesfaye failed to receive any nominations for the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards (2021). Tesfaye took to his social media to criticize the Recording Academy, claiming corruption. Speculation arose that the announcement of his then-upcoming Super Bowl performance as well as the discrepancy of being nominated as pop music versus R&B contributed to the snubs. On February 5, 2021 The Highlights was released, as his second greatest hits album. Tesfaye performed at the Super Bowl LV halftime show on February 7, 2021 after announcing he would perform in November 2020. He reportedly spent $7 million on his performance at the show.

Her breakout track, \"Sailor Song,\" released in July 2024, showcases her penchant for intimate storytelling and has drawn comparisons to artists like Hozier and Bon Iver. The song explores themes of love and identity, particularly focusing on a sapphic romance, which has sparked both widespread praise and controversy from conservative groups.\r\n\r\nPerez began her music career with the single \"Sometimes (Backwood)\" in 2021, which earned her a deal with Interscope Records. However, by 2024, she had gone independent, releasing \"Sailor Song\" through her own label. This track became her first charting single in the UK, peaking at number 35. Her 2023 EP, How to Catch a Falling Knife, also contributed to her growing acclaim.\r\n\r\nDespite facing some criticism, Perez has remained outspoken about her creative freedom, stating that her songwriting is a personal expression, not subject to external approval.

The lineup currently consists of Ryan Tedder (lead vocals, piano), Zach Filkins (lead guitar, viola), Drew Brown (rhythm guitar), Brent Kutzle (bass, cello), Eddie Fisher (drums), and Brian Willett (keyboards, violin).\r\n\r\nThe band achieved its first commercial success on Myspace as an unsigned act. In late 2002, after OneRepublic played shows throughout the Los Angeles area, several record labels approached the band with interest, but the band signed with Velvet Hammer, an imprint of Columbia Records. They made their first album with producer Greg Wells during the summer and fall of 2005 at his studio, Rocket Carousel, in Culver City, California. The album was scheduled for release on June 6, 2006, but the group was dropped by Columbia two months before the album was released. The lead single of that album, \"Apologize\", was released on April 30, 2006, on Myspace, eventually reaching number one on the Myspace charts.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, OneRepublic released their debut album, Dreaming Out Loud. Their lead single, \"Apologize\", was remixed by Timbaland, becoming a huge international success, reaching number one in sixteen countries and subsequently earning them a Grammy Award nomination. The second single, \"Stop and Stare\", mirrored its predecessor\'s success. The album was later certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The band\'s second album, Waking Up (2009), produced the singles \"All the Right Moves\", \"Secrets\", \"Marchin On\", and \"Good Life\", with the last reaching the top ten of the US Billboard Hot 100.\r\n\r\nOneRepublic\'s third album, Native (2013), became the band\'s first top ten album on the Billboard 200, and highest-charting album to date, charting at number four. The lead single, \"If I Lose Myself\", charted within the top ten in several countries, while the album\'s third single, \"Counting Stars\", became the band\'s most successful single in recent years, obtaining top-five placements in Australia, Canada, Germany, Ireland, New Zealand, the US, and the UK. This marks their highest-charting single in the United Kingdom to date. It also peaked at number 2 on the US Billboard Hot 100, matching the group\'s highest peak of \"Apologize\" in 2007.\r\n\r\nOn October 7, 2016, OneRepublic released Oh My My, their fourth studio album, featuring several collaborators, including Cassius, Peter Gabriel, and Santigold. Preceded by the singles \"Wherever I Go\", released on May 13, 2016, and \"Kids\", released on August 12, 2016, it was recognized as a change in their sound from previous albums by critics and by the band. In 2017, the band released the singles \"No Vacancy\", \"Truth to Power\", \"Stranger Things\" with Kygo and \"Rich Love\" with Seeb. Their fifth studio album, Human, was released in 2021. The band has sold approximately over 16 million records worldwide.\r\n\r\nOn November 1, 2021, OneRepublic released the song \"Sunshine\". The song is used as the theme song to the 2021 film Clifford the Big Red Dog.\r\n\r\nIn February 2022, OneRepublic released the song \"West Coast\". The song is the lead single from OneRepublic’s upcoming sixth studio album. The song is an ode to the American state of California and evokes classic 1960s California sounds, stemming from groups such as The Beach Boys and The Mamas and the Papas, along with inspiration from Gorillaz. It has been both a band favorite and a fan favorite for a long time, and it ultimately became a tone-setter for their sixth studio effort. They first started working on “West Coast” during the production process of their 2016 album, Oh My My, but ended up shelving it for later. An earlier version of the song was used for U2’s 2017 hit, “Summer of Love,” which actually turned the original demo into an anti-war track.\r\n\r\nAfter years of anticipation and re-tooling, the final version of “West Coast” was officially made public on February 25, 2022.\r\n\r\nOn April 1, 2022, OneRepublic released \"You Were Loved\" as a single with DJ and producer Gryffin.

It will also be featured on their upcoming sixth studio album which is rumored to be released by the end of the summer.

Their primary signature comprises inimitable, elegant, four-part harmonies, earworm melodic hooks, and rhythmic imagination. Beginning with 2005\'s \"Ella y Yo\" (feat. Don Omar) they placed numerous singles inside the Top Ten, including the chart-toppers \"Por un Segundo\" and \"Dile al Amor.\" Further, nine of their albums charted, including 2009\'s pop crossover The Last, which topped the list, as did its live follow-up, 2011\'s 14 +14. They have won countless Premio Lo Nuestro, Premio Juventud, and Billboard Music awards. After taking a multi-year hiatus in 2011, they returned in 2014 as part of Romeo\'s sold-out Yankee Stadium concert, and in 2016 played sold-out shows across Latin America, Europe, and the United States. In 2019 they issued the single \"Inmortal\" as the final chart-topping track on Romeo\'s Utopia album and later performed it live with him at MetLife Stadium. In 2021, Aventura teamed with Bad Bunny on the chart-topping single \"Volví.\" The quartet released the single \"Brindo con Agua\" in 2024.\r\n\r\nThe group was formed in 1994 in the Bronx by four boys of Dominican heritage (Anthony \"Romeo\" Santos, Lenny Santos, Max Santos, and Henry Santos Jeter) determined to break bachata music into the pop mainstream by fusing it with sounds they heard every day on the radio, including hip-hop and R&B. Unlike other young acts seeking success, they didn\'t hand themselves over to a producer who would mold their image and sound. Instead, they proceeded to learn skills needed to succeed, from production and arrangement to songwriting and playing instruments. \r\n\r\nAfter years playing parties and local festivals, they caught a break and signed to BMG. They released their debut long-player, Generation Next, with the assistance of an outside producer (at the label\'s insistence). The group insisted on writing their own material, and they successfully resisted the label\'s attempt to turn them into a cookie-cutter boy band in the style of the Backstreet Boys or *NSYNC by ensuring bachata remained dominant in all their songs. Unfortunately, the album fell between the cracks of both the burgeoning Latin movement and the pop/R&B chart-toppers.\r\n\r\nAfter touring regionally, opening for other acts, and playing their own shows across the East Coast, they released We Broke the Rules, a blueprint that showcased their mature style. The album title proved prescient as Romeo penned lyrics outside the subjects of romance and heartbreak, and Max\'s guitar work strayed from the classic, clean bachata lead and rhythmic styles by employing all manner of electronics and effects. Further, Lenny was the first to incorporate funky slap bass and chordal rock riffs into bachata. \"Obsesión,\" the set\'s first single, became a hit with Latin audiences, finding a strong crossover into hip-hop. The album peaked at number 56 on the Top Latin Albums list. \r\n\r\nWhile growing a North American audience, they also became popular in Europe, thanks to frequent touring. In 2003, they returned with Love & Hate, which saw them experimenting even further with their sound, adding merengue into the mix and upping the R&B/hip-hop quotient without losing touch with their background, singing in Spanish, English, and Spanglish. The set reached number 66 at Top Latin Albums. These releases, promising and adventurous as they were, were a prologue to 2005\'s God\'s Project. Widely regarded as the group\'s best album to date, it went all the way to number five on the Latin albums list and netted the chart-topping single \"Ella y Yo\" (feat. Don Omar); they followed with the two-CD/one-DVD set K.O.B.: Live. \r\n\r\nBy 2007, Aventura were one of the biggest Latin groups in the world. They became the first bachata group to sell out Madison Square Garden in the round. Later that year they released Kings of Bachata: Sold Out at Madison Square Garden featuring guest performances from Miri Ben-Ari, Wisin & Yandel, and Don Omar. It topped the Tropical and Latin albums charts and placed inside the top half of the Top 200. That same year, they also took home two Lo Nuestro awards and three Billboard Music Awards. \r\n\r\nThese successes set the table for their fifth studio outing, 2009\'s The Last. The best-selling set featured guest appearances from Wyclef Jean, Ludacris, Akon, and Wisin y Yandel. It netted six charting singles including the number ones \"Dime el Amor\" and \"El Malo.\" The Last became the top-selling Latin album of 2009 and 2010. It spent 23 weeks at number one on the Latin Billboard chart and peaked at number five in the Top 200. Two years later, the audio-video set 14 Plus 14 arrived, featuring 14 of the group\'s greatest hits along with their accompanying videos. It was a swan song, and they went on hiatus in 2011 to pursue other projects. Romeo and Henry Santos both engaged in successful solo careers while Lenny and Max formed Grupo Vena.\r\n\r\nAventura unofficially reunited in 2014 when they performed together during Romeo\'s sold-out Yankee Stadium concert. They officially reunited a year later by announcing a month-long series of concerts at the United Palace Theater in New York. These took place in early 2016. That year, the band\'s compilation Todavía Me Amas: Lo Mejor De Aventura, peaked at number one on the Tropical albums chart. \r\n\r\nIn April 2019 Aventura released the single and music video \"Inmortal,\" as part of Santos\'s fourth studio album, Utopia. It debuted at number five at Hot Latin Songs, and at number 95 on the Hot 100. Aventura won Tropical Duo/Group of the Year at the Billboard Latin Music Awards and performed \"Inmortal\" alongside Raulin Rodriguez. They also performed during Romeo\'s Utopia concert at the MetLife Stadium, offering \"Dile al Amor,\" \"Todavia Me Amas,\" and \"Inmortal\" (The latter, issued as a single, peaked at number one, spending 18 weeks on the Hot 100.) In December, Aventura announced the La Gira Inmortal tour, their first in a decade. It kicked off in February of 2020, but after only ten shows they were forced off the road by the COVID-19 pandemic that canceled live music all over the world. \r\n\r\nIn August 2021, Aventura surprised fans with the release of the single and video for \"Volvi\" in collaboration with Bad Bunny. It topped the Hot Latin Songs charts and the video racked up 250 million views during its first two weeks. The quartet returned in 2024 with the single \"Brindo con Agua.\" ~ Chris Nickson & Thom Jurek <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Aventura\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

If its predecessor, Gold Chain Cowboy, announced Parker’s arrival in the country music mainstream, Never Enough (MCA Nashville) says that, damn right, he’s here to stay.\r\n\r\nLike Gold Chain Cowboy, it pairs Parker with producer Jon Randall (Miranda Lambert, Dierks Bentley), a fellow Texan who understands exactly what fuels Parker’s artistry: authenticity, vulnerability, and a little bit of defiance. Never Enough bristles with honesty and attitude and is shot through with equal parts rock guitar and country songwriting.\r\n\r\n“What I do best is write songs from a very real place and sing country music, but also be very ‘me’ and not try to sound like someone else,” Parker says. “We definitely did that on this record and every one of the 15 songs sounds different.”\r\n\r\nCompare album opener “Hurricane” and the confessional ballad “Have Your Heart Again” to hear his point. “Hurricane,” a song about a strong-willed girl who blows through your life and leaves it in tatters, is a driving rock anthem with a guitar riff that calls to mind the theme from Friends (“I’m sure some people will hate on that, but I don’t give a shit,” Parker laughs. “I thought it was cool”). “Have Your Heart Again,” meanwhile, is a simple vocal-and-piano arrangement with Parker hitting a stunning falsetto note. The songs are each irresistible and unique, rich in lyrical imagery, and unlike anything you’ll hear coming out of Nashville today.\r\n\r\nCredit that to Parker, as sturdy as a live oak, for knowing exactly who he is.\r\n\r\n“This town can eat you alive, the music business can eat you alive, with artists trying to remain relevant and have hit songs. That’s something I never cared about when I’m writing or making a record,” he says. “I’m never thinking about singles. I’m trying to just write songs that can potentially stand the test of time. That’s the sole purpose of writing songs for me.”\r\n\r\nEven Never Enough tracks that have since become gold-certified hits weren’t written with radio in mind. To Parker, “Handle on You” was just a drinking song with clever lyricism (“I tell myself that I should quit/but I don’t listen to drunks”) and a late-Eighties country sound as smooth as Tennessee whiskey or, perhaps, a Shiner Bock.\r\n\r\n“That song is a nod to some of the great records I grew up with,” says Parker, who counts George Strait, Willie Nelson, and cult hero Chris Knight as chief inspirations. “A lot of radio songs nowadays are kind of bubble-gummy. I don’t have any problem with pop-country, but I’d like to hear a little more classic country too. My team kept saying ‘Handle on You’ was a radio song and I said, ‘If y’all put that on the radio, then hell yeah.’”\r\n\r\nA mostly solitary songwriter prior to his entrée into Nashville, Parker has now written with some of country music’s finest. Hillary Lindsey, Lori McKenna, and Liz Rose (a.k.a. The Love Junkies), David Lee Murphy, Brett James, and Ashley Gorley all contribute to Never Enough, along with Parker’s Texas peers Randy Rogers, Wade Bowen, and Ryan Beaver.\r\n\r\n“That’s been the biggest change since coming to Nashville: having access to some of the best songwriters in the world and sitting in a room with them to write,” Parker says. “The way these songwriters care and write, it’s from a place that I think I do as well. It’s made me look at songwriting differently.”\r\n\r\nThe proof is in Parker’s chart history. He scored his first-ever No. 1 country hit with 2020’s “Pretty Heart,” his debut single. “To Be Loved by You” followed suit, also hitting No. 1. Now, he’s staring down a career-making single in “Burn It Down,” a moody, smoldering break-up song that equates a busted relationship to a house reduced to just ashes and smoke.\r\n\r\n\r\nWritten with the Love Junkies, “Burn It Down” was born during a writing session at Parker’s home, where he spontaneously started singing the words “burn it down” over and over again. “Some days are like that, where the melody and the idea for the song is so good and everybody is on the same page,” he says. “If you’re talking about moving the needle in my career, ‘Burn It Down’ is probably going to be the song.”\r\n\r\nParker lives for the type of spontaneous creation that happened that day. He’ll often challenge himself to write a song without changing a single word. He did that with “Too Tight This Time.” With a pretty acoustic guitar lick, a Dobro guest shot by Jerry Douglas, and a heavy dose of humility and introspection in Parker’s vocal performance, “Too Tight This Time” is Parker’s favorite track on Never Enough.\r\n\r\n“I said, ‘Let’s pour this thing out and whatever it is in 15 minutes, that’s what it’s going to be forever.’ I love to write songs like that and live with the end result. This one was easy to do because the melody was so good,” he says. “The line ‘There must be something broken inside this lonely man’ just hits so hard.”\r\n\r\nFor all his quiet strength and rough-hewn masculinity, Parker isn’t afraid to bare his soul. But, ironically, one of the most personal songs on Never Enough is the only song he didn’t write: “Things I Never Told You,” penned by Monty Criswell, Lynn Hutton, and Taylor Phillips, parallels Parker’s relationship with his mother. “When I moved away from home/I didn’t realize how much I’d miss ya,” he sings. “A phone call don’t take the place/of your smilin’ face cooking in that kitchen.”\r\n\r\n“Those lines were all in there. People send me songs all the time and I never really hear any that I’m blown away by,” he says. Currently getting ready for a massive summer tour, including stadium dates with Morgan Wallen, Parker debuted “Things I Never Told You” for his mother during rehearsals. “We were in this massive amphitheater and my mom came the last day and I sang it for her. It was pretty cool.”\r\n\r\nTo Parker, the gesture was a way to show he cared. Never Enough then is a testament to how much he cares about country music.\r\n\r\n“Sometimes I wish I didn’t care so much because everything would be easier. Hopefully one day people will look back at what I’ve done in country music and think it was honest and good for the genre,” Parker says. “This album may be called Never Enough, but if they see that what I did was real, that’ll be enough for me.” <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Parker+McCollum\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Kahan followed it up with the release of \"Northern Attitude\" on September 16.\r\n\r\nOn October 14, 2022, Kahan released his album Stick Season. According to early reviews of the album from AP News, \"There’s irony there because these feel like songs both longtime listeners and newer fans will want to belt back to Kahan — not because they’re produced for stadiums or arenas, but because they’re full of nostalgic melodies that will resonate far beyond New England.\" Kahan wrote this album during the pandemic which he spent back home in Vermont. Stick Season leans more into the folk genre than the rest of his older music which were more pop sounding. Kahan says that in his album, Stick Season, he wanted to pay homage to the folk singers that he grew up listening to. He adds that his greatest goal as a songwriter is to write music that other people can relate to and to be able to throw that lifeline to someone.\r\n\r\nOn March 17, 2023, Kahan was featured on Joy Oladokun\'s single \"We\'re All Gonna Die\", which was also released as part of her April 2023 album, Proof of Life.\r\n\r\nOn June 9, 2023, Kahan released a deluxe version of Stick Season titled, Stick Season (We\'ll All Be Here Forever), which includes seven previously unreleased tracks. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Noah+Kahan\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Duran Duran have sold over 100 million records, making them one of the world\'s best-selling music artists. They achieved 30 top 40 singles in the UK Singles Chart (14 of them top 10) and 21 top 40 singles in the US Billboard Hot 100. The band have won numerous awards throughout their career: two Brit Awards including the 2004 award for Outstanding Contribution to Music, two Grammy Awards, an MTV Video Music Award for Lifetime Achievement, and a Video Visionary Award from the MTV Europe Music Awards. They were also awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The band was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame as part of the class of 2022.\r\n\r\nCreated by Nick Rhodes (keyboards) and John Taylor (bass) in Birmingham, England in 1978, it later add took in Roger Taylor  (drums), Andy Taylor (guitar), and Simon Le Bon (lead vocals). The band has sold more than 100 million records over their more than 40 years of existence, making them one of the best-selling groups in history.\r\n\r\nTheir songs are often vivid, hook-laden pieces dance pop that have fared well on the radio, but what many remember best about Duran Duran is their iconic music videos. Though many of the videos were tongue-in-cheek, the band has never quite escaped the glamorous and decadent \'jet set\' image that their early videos projected. Their flashy outfits and strident, art rock influenced music showed an immense debt to 70s English glam artists such as David Bowie and Roxy Music, yet the band grasped a sense of their own identity and became one of the keystones of the new romantic movement.\r\n\r\nTheir first singer and one of their original founding members was Stephen Duffy, and their original bassist was Simon Colley. Several drummers and guitarists were subsequently tried, as well as a handful of vocalists, after Duffy left Duran Duran early in 1979. The band felt that they had something special with vocalist Simon Le Bon, and the group smashed into the pop scene shortly afterwards when \"Planet Earth\", their debut single, was released on 2 February 1981.\r\n\r\n\"Planet Earth\" became an immediate hit in the band\'s native U.K., reaching #12 on the U.K. Singles Chart on 21 February, and it did even better in Australia, hitting #8 there. Being Duran Duran\'s first Top 10 hit anywhere in the world, the song showed the group\'s interest in international stardom. The band\'s eponymous debut album came out promptly afterwards in June 1981. \'Duran Duran\' hit #3 on the album charts and remained in the U.K. Top 100 for 117 weeks, achieving platinum status by December 1982. The initial United States release failed to generate much interest at first, but the group was a British sensation due to their strident mix of pop rock and electronic music.\r\n\r\nMusic videos for hit singles \"Planet Earth\" and \"Careless Memories\" were filmed in December 1980. As they also experienced considerable success with \"Girls on Film\", which hit #5 on the UK Singles Chart and #11 on the Australian Singles Chart, the group firmly grasped the opportunity to make a name for themselves in musical television. As their fame grew, some fans worried that Duran Duran could have peaked too early. They headed into AIR Studios in London in early 1982 anxious to somehow top themselves.\r\n\r\nBand member John Taylor came up with the new album\'s title, \'Rio\', as a product of his fascination with the flaunting sexuality and diverse atmosphere of Brazil. He later said, \"Rio, to me, was shorthand for the truly foreign, the exotic, a cornucopia of earthly delights, a party that would never stop.\" The band had their own plans and ambitions for promotion and reunited with director Russell Mulcahy (who was behind the video for \"Planet Earth\") to plan out the release of a full length \'video album\'— eleven videos in total. Totally dedicated to on-site filming,  guitarist Andy Taylor even contracted a tropical virus and ended up hospitalized, thankfully getting better relatively quickly.\r\n\r\n\'Rio\' was, simply, a commercial juggernaut. The band\'s second studio album, originally released worldwide on 10 May 1982, reached #2 in the UK and #1 in Australia. Massively popular in the U.S., it earned a gold disc on 1 March 1983 and went platinum on 26 April 1983, eventually reaching double-platinum status. As songs such as \"Hungry Like the Wolf\" and \"Rio\" received considerable airplay, critical acclaim also grew for the release. With MTV heavily playing the band\'s music videos, the album is still held as one of the best new wave albums ever. In April 2013, \'Rio\' was even voted #3 in BBC Radio 2\'s \'Top 100 Favourite Albums of all time\' list.\r\n\r\nIn 1985, Duran Duran performed \"A View To A Kill\" for the the James Bond film of the same name. The song appeared in the movie\'s title sequence and was also a best-selling single in its own right. In 1987, \"Out Of My Mind\" was featured at the end credits of the drama film \'The Saint\' as well.\r\n\r\nLike Depeche Mode, Duran Duran was among the earliest bands to work on their own remixes. From the very beginning, the band had a keen sense of style, and worked with stylist Perry Haines and fashion designers such as Kahn & Bell and Antony Price to build a sharp and elegant image, soon growing beyond the ruffles and sashes of the pirate-flavoured New Romantic look.\r\n\r\nAlthough the group never disbanded, it went through several line-up changes over the years - American guitarist Warren Cuccurullo (formerly of Missing Persons) was also a member of the band from 1989 to 2001, and drummer Sterling Campbell was a member from 1989 to 1991. John Taylor, Roger Taylor and Andy Taylor all returned in 2001 and created a stir among music media and the band\'s fans. Duran Duran released the first album from the reunited line-up, Astronaut, in 2004, which was in turn followed up by many sold out shows in England, most notably Wembley Arena, where a live DVD of the tour was filmed in 2004/2005.\r\n\r\nIn October of 2006, it was announced on Duran Duran\'s website that Andy Taylor had left the band. The band\'s latest album, \'Red Carpet Massacre\' was released in November 2007.  They performed the album live in New York City on Broadway at the Barrymore Theater, for what was originally scheduled as an unprecedented 10-night run. A stage hand union strike shortened the run by a few nights, but Duran Duran were able to re-schedule the shows elsewhere. They went on to tour the world, ending their successful run in December of 2008. \r\n\r\n2008 also saw the release of a new DVD that documents the making of their now-classic \"Rio\" album (called \"Classic Albums: Rio (Collector\'s Edition)\"), and a book called \"Would Someone Please Explain?\"- a compilation of questions from the \"Ask Katy\" area of their popular website.   \r\n\r\nDuran Duran returned at the end of 2010 with their 13th album, the digital and self-released album All You Need Is Now which debuted at number one on the iTunes charts in many countries (including the USA).  The physical version of the album will be released with bonus tracks in February 2011.  The album was produced by Mark Ronson.  \r\n\r\n2015 saw the band return with the album Paper Gods, which was led by the single \"Pressure Off\" featuring Janelle Monae and Nile Rodgers. The album was the band\'s first top 10 chart success in the U.S. in over 20 years, and also reached number 5 in the U.K. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Duran+Duran\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

He was raised by his father, Richard Post, and his stepmother, Jodie. His father had been a DJ in his youth and introduced Malone to many different genres of music including hip-hop, country, and rock. When Malone was nine years old, he and his family moved to Grapevine, Texas, after his father became the manager of concessions for the Dallas Cowboys. Malone began to play the guitar and auditioned for the American band Crown the Empire in 2010, but was rejected after his guitar strings broke during the audition. He credited his initial interest in learning guitar to the video game Guitar Hero.\r\n\r\nMalone has always had a love for alternative rock music, and appeared for a DJ set at Emo Nite in Los Angeles, California, in June 2017, playing songs by American alt-rock band My Chemical Romance at the event. According to Malone, his first foray into professional music began when he was in a heavy metal band. He says soon afterward he transitioned to softer rock as well as hip-hop, before beginning to experiment on FL Studio.\r\n\r\nAccording to Malone, he chose \"Post Malone\" as his stage name when he was 14 or 15. The name was rumored to be a reference to the professional basketball player Karl Malone, but Malone later explained that \"Post\" is his last name, and he used a \"rap name generator\" to get \"Malone\".

Malone recorded the song two days after writing it. The lyrics of \"White Iverson\" allude to Basketball Hall of Fame player Allen Iverson. In February 2015, upon completion, it was uploaded to Malone\'s SoundCloud account. On July 19, 2015, Malone released a music video for \"White Iverson\".\r\n\r\nAfter hitting one million views within a month of releasing \"White Iverson\", Malone quickly garnered attention from record labels.

In August 2015, he performed at Kylie Jenner\'s 18th birthday party, where he met Kanye West, who enjoyed his music, leading to him collaborating with Malone on his single \"Fade\" from his album The Life of Pablo.

He was going in more of a rock/pop/country direction.\" However, Malone denied these claims, explaining that his latest mixtape, as well as his album, were both hip-hop. In August 2016, Malone issued an apology for his album, Stoney, being late. It was available for pre-order on November 4 and was finally released on December 9. Malone later went on to call the album \"mediocre\", despite the success of the single \"Congratulations\" featuring Quavo, Malone\'s first top-ten song on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number eight.

The band consists of Dan Reynolds (vocals), Wayne Sermon (guitar) and Ben McKee (bass) . The band released four EPs - \"Imagine Dragons\" (2009), \"Hell and Silence\" (2010), \"It\'s Time\" (2011) and \"Continued Silence\" (2012) - before releasing their debut full length album \"Night Visions\" on 4 September 2012.\r\n\r\nThe band\'s single \"It\'s Time\", which previously appeared on the \"It\'s Time\" and \"Continued Silence\" EPs in addition to appearing on \"Night Visions\", is the group\'s biggest hit, reaching #33 on the Billboard Hot 100.\r\n\r\nIn a dark kitchen in the middle of a sweaty night in Las Vegas, all 6’4” of Dan Reynolds is hunched over a laptop, slapping beats on the table and crooning lyrics into a tiny microphone.  Before long, he and the other three members of pop rock band Imagine Dragons would be playing “It’s Time,” that same laptop-demo-turned-supersized-anthem, from the roof of a parking garage to a wave of thousands of screaming fans.  This song title to the single from their 2012 debut KidInaKorner/Interscope release “Continued Silence EP” is an all too apt descriptor of the band’s hard-earned success—but it’s also emblematic of the deep-seated anxiety Reynolds and the rest of the band experienced leaving behind any realistic expectation of a normal job to do the thing they love most. \r\n\r\nA third-generation Las Vegas native, Reynolds is no stranger to the adage “the house always wins,” choosing to pave his musical career with a near obsessive work ethic and hundreds of unused demos rather than roll the dice with the first songs that sprung from his mouth.  It’s no surprise, then, that he was drawn to guitarist Wayne Sermon, another founding member of Imagine Dragons.  Having practically grown up in a recording studio and graduated Berklee College of Music, Wayne had been practicing his guitar through meals and other socially inappropriate situations as long as he could remember; he challenged Dan in a way that was both uncomfortable and exactly what they both needed.  When they began writing songs together and recognized something special was happening, Wayne called up his Berklee friend Ben McKee, who promptly dropped out of school with only a few credits left, moving across the country to play bass for the band.  This sort of reckless/genius behavior is typical for Ben, who has an uncanny penchant for spicy food and a suitcase full of unbelievable road stories.  More recently, the band was joined by drummer Daniel Platzman, another Bostonian schoolmate who seems way too nice to be playing rock and roll until you actually see him in action.\r\n\r\nSeveral tours and three self-released EPs later, Imagine Dragons had made a serious name for itself, particularly in the west coast circuit.  Although their songs vary from nearly whimsical and light to brooding and powerful, listeners are drawn to the inherent honesty in the music.  The only rule of thumb for the band, it seems, is to write from a true place; the result is songs that literally run the spectrum of human emotion.  Attend a concert, and it becomes clear that the live performance of deeply personal songs has a real effect on people.  And the band itself is not immune, as demonstrated when Dan literally passed out into the drum set during a finale song, sending cymbals and drum stands crashing while the rest of the band played on until the close.\r\n\r\nGreat songwriting is bound to be noticed eventually.  As proof that the harder you work, the luckier you get, one of those people who noticed was Grammy winning producer Alex da Kid (Eminem, Rihanna).  Alex and Dan began collaborating on projects, and soon the band had developed a relationship with Alex and his team.  The alchemy resulting from Alex’s hip hop sensibilities and Imagine Dragons’ anthemic pop is nothing short of explosive.  The byproduct of this creative collision is “Continued Silence,” a six song in-your-face sonic grenade that breaks musical boundaries and yet is strangely relatable by its improbably diverse audience. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Imagine+Dragons\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Stellar (스텔라)  was a South Korean girl group whose final lineup was composed of Minhee, Hyoeun, Soyoung and Youngheun. Formed in 2011 by The Entertainment Pascal, the group attracted attention as they were initially produced by Eric Mun of the boy band Shinhwa (신화). Following an unsuccessful debut with the single \"Rocket Girl\" in August 2011, Stellar underwent a line-up change and released \"UFO\" in February 2012, which fared similarly. The group began working with the production team MonoTree in July 2013 and released \"Study\", which experienced modest success and became their first single to chart in the top 100 of the Gaon Digital Chart.\r\n\r\nStellar gained notoriety in February 2014, when they adopted a more \"provocative\" image for the release of their first extended play Marionette. The album\'s title track peaked at number thirty-five on the Gaon Digital Chart, making it their most commercially successful single. This stylistic change in direction would be maintained in Stellar\'s subsequent releases \"Vibrato\" in 2015 and their second extended play Sting in 2016. With the addition of new member Soyoung, the group released their third and last extended play Stellar Into the World and its title track \"Archangels of the Sephiroth\" on June 27, 2017. On February 25, 2018, the group announced their disbandment in a fan-meeting after deciding to not renew their contracts with their agency.\r\n\r\n2. Stellar is  from a small town outside of Lowell, Massachusetts. His career launched on August 6th, 2019 with the release of his debut mixtape Bipolar. Almost a year later Stellar established himself as an upcoming artist with the release of his breakout Dark Pop single \'Ashes\'. Stellar represents the city of Boston, trying to further the prominence of the city\'s sound in Hip Hop, R&B, and Pop. Some of Stellar\'s major influences range from the late rapper Juice WRLD, to the highly coveted pop band Maroon 5.\r\n\r\n3. Stellar is a band formed in 1995 in Rio de JaneiroBrazil with the end of the bands: Second Come, Drivellers and Stellarblast. The band members are: Fábio Leopoldino (ex-Second Come), Beatriz Lamego (ex-Drivellers), Cadu (ex-Drivellers) and Leandro Ferreira. They recorded their first demo “Thrumming Soothingly” in this year.\r\nIn 1997 Leandro leaves the band and Sol Moras (ex-Swallow 5) join the band in his place. They decided to record some new music and from that, \"Transmigrations\", their second demo was launched.\r\nTheir first full album, \"Ultramar\", was launched in 1999. In 2000 the band reunited to make their fourth show in six years. From the rehearsal for this show the band recorded their last album, \"4\". Today, 2007, some of the members are playing in shows with the band Pelvs. Official site: http://mmrecords.com.br/200705/stellar/\r\n\r\n4. Stellar* is a band from New Zealand. In 1992, musicians Boh Runga and Andrew Maclaren moved to Auckland from Christchurch. Eventually with other musicians, initially guitarist Joel Haines they formed Stellar* in 1994. Originally a three piece they wrote their fist single Ride. This featured in a short film Headlong by Simon Raby. The band in its initial form didn\'t last. Later Runga and Maclaren came across bass player Kurt Shanks and reformed the band as a four piece.\r\nIn 1998 the band signed on with Sony BMG music NZ, later that year they released their first commecial single What You Do (Bastard). 1999 saw their first album release Mix, then the second-highest selling NZ album ever. The album was produced by ex-Thompson Twins singer Tom Bailey.\r\nMix would go on to gain Stellar* numorous accolades at New Zealand\'s 2000 Tui awards. It was also released in Australia, and resulted in Stellar* being a tour support for Alanis Morissette (who they got along well with) and Garbage (who they did not get along with, owing to similarities between the two bands). An extended version of Mix was also released, which featured a CD-ROM of three of their music videos.\r\nIn 2001 a follow-up album was released, Magic Line, a far more pop-rock based album than their first. After the release of a few singles from it, the band took an extended break, which due to different band members solo projects, took five years. Finally, 2006 bore release of their third album Something like Strangers.\r\n\r\n5. Stellar began life in 1995. The origins of the band lay with Ronan O\'Hanlon and Martin Carroll who had been writing and recording together since 1991, developing their songwriting, and recording demos. They moved to Liverpool in 1995, by which time Sarah Mason (vocals), Graham Tonks (bass) and Shane Johnson (keyboards) had joined the band. A demo was sent to 4AD, who responded positively and signed Stellar for a one-off deal with Detox Artifacts where they released a 4-track CD. Stellar played the launch party for Detox at Disgracelands, London in September 1996. The audience included Liz Frazer, and Andrew Weatherall. The CD came out shortly afterwards. Stellar continued for another year, gigging up North at venues such as The Hacienda, Night and Day in Manchester and Liverpool Lomax. After a move to London, the band disbanded and Ronan and Martin are now based in London as The Sleepless.

I just don\'t say anything now... Everything is wrong online.\"\r\n\r\nShe explained choosing a music career: \"One day I was at the park with my family, all my cousins and stuff, in Frankston... We were all just singing a song and my aunty was like \'oh guys, she can actually hold a note.\' I think that\'s the earliest memory of someone actually pointing me out as someone that has an ability to sing. I was probably like 7 years old.\" The singer-songwriter had learned to play keyboards and drum pads while at secondary school.She started busking in Melbourne, while working in fashion retail at the Universal Store.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, as Toni Watson, she created a YouTube page and posted a cappella cover versions of songs. She performed local gigs and festivals, including the Let Go festival. Tones was the vocalist for a duo in 2014, and remembered: \"I started out singing in small pubs and bars in Mornington, I was singing along to a guitarist until I ended up branching out on my own.\" She explained her shift to a solo career: \"I actually got made redundant from my retail job and with that money I bought an RC300 (loop station) and just started to try to figure it all out.\" She busked \"up and down the east coast with her synthesizers and loop pedal, she has been building a loyal fanbase and captivating crowds with her genre-diverse style.\"\r\n\r\nIn September 2017, the singer-songwriter travelled to Byron Bay in the Australian state of New South Wales to try busking there. At an early performance, she met Jackson Walkden-Brown who became her manager about a month later. Her busking success led to a greater commitment to a music career. The artist spent 2018 living between Walkden-Brown\'s home in the Gold Coast hinterland and in her van in Byron Bay, writing music and busking full-time.

Writing and singing have always been the saving grace that helped Barrett feel less alone in the world and less alone with her thoughts as she battled demons from her past and mental health struggles, including borderline personality disorder and an eating disorder.\r\n\r\nWith young forever, Barrett embraces her internal and external conflicts, takes bleak thoughts, and expresses them bravely. \"I like the darkness in things,\" she says. \"I talk about a lot of things my generation is struggling with on this album.\" From the moody single \"tired of california,\" where Barrett muses on the lack of authenticity in the City of Angels, to the psychological thriller-themed \"madhouse,\" which deliciously weaves synth with Barrett\'s manic melody, to the acoustic \"lovebomb,\" which finds Barrett singing about her struggles with BPD, young forever, is a dynamic debut rooted in reflection and raw emotions.\r\n\r\nPunctuated by her grit-glam marvel, Barrett\'s music has intrinsically always been about empowering people who feel isolated. \"Growing up, I was very ashamed of my struggles, so the second I got a platform, I knew what I had to do with it because I didn\'t want anyone to feel the way I felt - alone.\" With young forever, Barrett has crafted something truly special. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Nessa+Barrett\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Founded in 2014, the indie dance band from Montreal, Canada loves smooth sounds, calm melodies and simple rhythms that relax, but make your right foot tap and your chin bounce on the beats. They record, mix, master and shoot their music videos. \r\n\r\nJessy and Dragos knew each other since their fourth year of high school. Back then (mid-2000’s), Dragos had somewhat of a background in classical piano and Jessy mastered the dark and esoteric art of the metal guitar solist.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, while finishing his master’s degree in audio postproduction at Laval University, Dragos spent most of his days and sleeping hours at the “LARC” studio working on his solo projects. He randomly met Jessy again, who was finishing his bachelor degree in Jazz guitar, in one of the faculty’s hallways and talked about doing a French-Touch / Italo-Disco track together. Some weeks later, they did just that. And it worked out so well that they decided to extend their collaboration to a whole project where many singers such as Odile Marmet-Rochefort, Gabrielle Shonk, Helena Deland and Geoffroy Sauvé, would be involved.\r\n\r\nBetween 2012 and 2016, all of Jessy’s and Dragos’ releases were made as part of Dragos’ masters and (dropped) PhD studies in order to gain access to the LARC’s infrastructure and to develop a unique sound.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmma was a fortuitous encounter. In 2015 a mutual friend presented her to Dragos through a video posted over the Internet. She was casually singing and playing the guitar around a campfire with some of her friends. Emma’s voice was different, being less clear, more grainy and fragile with a mysterious twist that caught their attention. They reached her and tried recording one song called “Out in myself”, which turned to be one of the band’s easiest to record.\r\n\r\nJessy and Dragos then invited her to join them on live shows with Odile at the beginning of 2015. The womans\' voices blended wonderfully together and the band got lots of positive feedback from the experience.

In spite of their popularity and impact, Coldplay have earned a reputation as polarizing music icons.\r\n\r\nHowever, in 2023 during the first concert in Romania, Coldplay made a totally blunder move in choosing a manele \"singer\' babasha as representative for the Romanian music which made the stadium start boo-ing the band and the singer. The band as well as the management failed to do proper research and see that Romanian Coldplay fans and generally Romanian rock fans dislike manele. This caused a scandal on social media where babasha said that whoever dislikes manele is a racist.\r\n\r\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coldplay\r\n\r\nStudio albums\r\nParachutes (2000)\r\nA Rush of Blood to the Head (2002)\r\nX&Y (2005)\r\nViva la Vida or Death and All His Friends (2008)\r\nMylo Xyloto (2011)\r\nGhost Stories (2014)\r\nA Head Full of Dreams (2015)\r\nEveryday Life (2019)\r\nMusic of the Spheres (2021)\r\nMoon Music (2024) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Coldplay\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Feuerstein endured a hardship-filled childhood in which his parents divorced, his mother\'s boyfriend physically abused him, and his mother eventually killed herself. Music was his escape, and he began recording songs on a karaoke machine, with instrumentals on one microphone and his raps in the other. Placing second in a nationwide Fine Arts Festival rap competition in 2008, and first in Michigan the following year, he independently released a debut album, Moments, in 2010. The album attracted the attention of Xist Music, which signed him to a recording deal in 2012, by which time Feuerstein had taken on the stage name NF. The label announced the release of an EP that same year, but it never appeared, and NF and Xist parted ways. NF spent the next two years looking for a label and working with local producer Tommee Profitt in his studio; they came up with the song \"Wake Up,\" which convinced Capitol Christian Music Group to sign him. CMG released a six-song (including a Manny Marroquin remix of \"Wake Up\") self-titled EP late in the summer of 2014. His debut album, Mansion, was released in early 2015 and reached number 62 on the Billboard 200 while topping the Christian Albums chart. The aptly titled Therapy Session followed in 2016 and also topped the Christian Albums chart with its raw emotions and honest lyrics. The following Summer saw the release of the singles \"Outro\" and \"Green Lights\", in anticipation of the arrival of his third studio long player, Perception, which dropped later that October. NF achieved mainstream popularity in 2017 with Perception; the album charted at number one in the United States and was certified platinum, while its third single, \"Let You Down\", reached number twelve on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, and was a top-ten hit internationally.

The band consists of Jesse Rutherford, Jeremy Freedman, Zach Abels, and Mikey Margott. Brandon Fried (drums) was kicked out of the band on November 15 2022 after groping allegations. Bryan Sammis (drums) left the group in January 2014.\r\n\r\nThe band released their first EP, I\'m Sorry... in January 2013, where their single Sweater Weather reached #1 in the U.S. Alternative Tracks and #8 on the U.S. Rock Tracks and #33 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song also charted at #68 in Canada. Their first album, I Love You. was released on April 23, 2013. \r\n\r\nIn early 2012 a mysterious band appeared online. The group, The Neighbourhood, revealed no biographical information, no photos and no backstory, offering only a moody track titled \"Female Robbery.\" Fans and the press were confounded, scouring the Internet for any information that might lead them to the identity of these musicians. Pieces of the puzzle, some reflecting reality and some not so much, began to emerge. The Neighbourhood were a quintet. They were from California despite the British spelling of their name. They had a second track, \"Sweater Weather,\" which had an accompanying -- and equally dark -- video.\r\n\r\nAlthough The Neighbourhood\'s identity remained hazy, it became clear that the music they were making felt transformative to critics and fans alike. The evocative combination of rock instruments with R&B and hip-hop aesthetics seemed, in many ways, revelatory, a reimagining of sounds that seemed to make people clamour for more information with even greater fervour. In April, BBC Radio One DJ Zane Lowe, an early champion of the group, let it slip that The Neighbourhood was the handiwork of musician Jesse Rutherford, a resident of Newbury Park, CA. By early May, as the band unveiled a free, self-released EP titled \"I\'m Sorry,\" it became understood that the identity of this young band was, ultimately, secondary to the music itself.\r\n\r\nSo who is The Neighbourhood? In essence, the group, which was formed in August 2011, is a collection of five friends who make music together. They\'re headed by Rutherford, a 21-year-old singer who has dabbled in various genres, including hip-hop, before crafting the merge of sounds that categorizes The Neighbourhood\'s style. Their debut EP was produced by Justyn Pilbrow, who brought Emile Haynie on board to collaborate on \"Female Robbery.\" The EP, recorded at the end of last year, is composed of shadowy, emotional music with visuals to match. And it\'s all part of the band\'s master plan.\r\n\r\n\"I always have a strong vision before I go into anything,\" Rutherford says. \"I don\'t know how to make music any other way. It was all in my head, and that vision for the music was to make hip-hop beats with guitars and I was going to sing and rap over them. We wanted to do that hip-hop aesthetic on an indie platform.\"\r\n\r\n\"I\'m Sorry,\" a five-song disc, is a precursor to the band\'s debut album, which is also being produced by Pilbrow and Haynie. The album, expected out in March 2013, will expand the group\'s moody sensibility, which pairs brooding layers of instrumentals with Rutherford\'s hip-hop-inspired croon. The style, which the band has dubbed \"black and white\" due to its confident inspirations, is based largely on rhythm, as evidenced by the EP. \"When I started in music I started doing drums and then I started doing vocals,\" Rutherford explains. \"And then I combined the two together because to me rapping is just rhythmic vocals. I think the rhythm of hip-hop is really what got me into it. It\'s not just words being said; it\'s about how the words are said.\"\r\n\r\nIn the end, all you need to know about The Neighbourhood is in that music and in those words. There are more facts, more pieces of the puzzle, more information to unveil. But what\'s the fun in being given the full picture when you can slowly discover it for yourself? It\'s better to leave some mystery lingering. Because, after all, it\'s that unknowing that brought The Neighbourhood to people\'s attention to begin with. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Neighbourhood\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

She was born in London of refugee parents from The Republic of Kosovo, growing up between both countries until fully moving back to London at age 15.\r\n\r\nDua Lipa began to write her name in the music industry. Lipa gained attention from the specialized media as an artist after the release of her debut album in 2017,  \"Dua Lipa\" (self-titled). It won the third position on the UK Albums Chart and featured eight singles. \"New Rules\"  and \"IDGAF\" have become global hits, reaching the number 1 position in countries such as Australia, Belgium, Ireland, and the United Kingdom, as well as reaching the top ten positions in more than 30 countries, including the USA for \"New Rules\" . The album featured the hits \"One Kiss\" with Calvin Harris, \"Be The One\", \"Scared To Be Lonely\" with Martin Garrix, \"No Lie\" with Sean Paul and many others.  It later received 5 nominations at the BRITs Awards, the most important British awards ceremony in music. She also won with her debut album two Grammys, \"Best Dance Recording\" for her song \"Electricity\" with Silk City, and moreover the \"Best New Artist\" award. \"Dua Lipa\" (self-titled) is the most streamed female album of all-time on Spotify.\r\n\r\nBut Lipa\'s great success would even come in her second album \"Future Nostalgia\", which made the promising young woman a true pillar of world pop music. Having hits such as \"Don\'t Start Now\", \"Break My Heart\" and \"Levitating\" , the album is currently the most played female album of the 2020\'s decade on Spotify and secured a Grammy at the 2021 ceremony for \"Best Pop Vocal Album\" and was present among the nominations for \"Album of the Year\". It also won the Brit Award for \"Album of the Year\". \"Future Nostalgia\" is the 2nd most streamed female album of all-time on Spotify. \"Don\'t Start Now\" became her most streamed hit on Spotify, nominated for \"Record of the Year\" at the Grammys. It was the biggest female song of the year 2020.\r\n\r\nThe British phenomenon has captured an all-time record on the Billboard Hot 100, all thanks to the success of \"Levitating\". The track became the longest-charting female song on the chart, with 77 weeks, being the 4th song overall to reach this astonishing feat. The same track became the biggest hit of 2021 in the United States and globally without ever reaching #1, proving once and for all that the disputed #1 position on the Billboard Hot 100, that she still doesn\'t have reached, doesn\'t define the success of an artist. For Lipa, it seems that longevity is more important than an instant success.\r\n\r\nHer song, \"Cold Heart\"  with  Elton John and  PNAU, was one of the biggest hits of 2022. She had during that year a sold-out global stadium and arena tour with \"The Future Nostalgia Tour\", marking her as a definitive icon of the beginning of the 2020\'s decade, especially in the European continent, her main music market.\r\n\r\nShe began her third album cycle in 2024, while also making her acting debut that year with \"Barbie\" and \"Argylle\" in 2024.

The septet co-writes and produces much of their output. Originally a hip hop group, their musical style has evolved to include a wide range of genres. Their lyrics, often focused on personal and social commentary, touch on the themes of mental health, troubles of school-age youth, loss, the journey towards loving oneself, and individualism. Their work features references to literature and psychological concepts and includes an alternative universe storyline. Popular for their live performances, the group have staged several world tours.\r\n\r\nThe group initially formed as teenagers under Big Hit Entertainment and released their debut single album, 2 Cool 4 Skool (2013). Subsequent work such as their first U.S. Billboard 200 entries The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Part 2 (2015), The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever (2016), and Wings (2016) helped establish BTS\' reputation as a socially conscious group. Wings became BTS\' first album to sell one million copies in South Korea. By 2017, BTS crossed into the international music market, leading the Korean Wave into the United States and breaking numerous sales records, becoming the first Korean group to receive a certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) with their single \"Mic Drop\".

Featured on Time\'s international cover as \"Next Generation Leaders\", BTS has appeared in the magazine\'s 25 most influential people on the internet (2017–2019) and Time\'s 100 most influential people in the world (2019), with the outlet giving them the nickname \'Princes of Pop\'. Forbes Korea named BTS the most influential celebrities of Korea in 2018, and BTS ranked 43rd in the Forbes Celebrity 100 (2019) as one of the world\'s top-earning celebrities. During their 2019 Love Yourself World Tour, BTS became the first Asian artist ever to headline and sell out Wembley Stadium and broke the record for the single highest-grossing engagement in Rose Bowl Stadium history.

This, although, leads us further to indulge in new possibilities about the anonymity, in which Macabre Plaza may be numerous persons instead of a singular being. That possibility though is again a shaky one, being that in the description of the YouTube version of their song \"Abandoned Plaza\" posted by the Vada Vada label, it is stated that the song had been written/composed by someone named Oreole, which can easily be interpreted as \"Oreole\" being the hidden figure behind the project all along. \r\n\r\nUntil then, little is known about the acclaimed Macabre Plaza, and with it\'s swift uprise in popularity as of 2023, there is plenty of fun to be had divulging into the rabbit hole of music commonly labelled as \"elevator music\" that is produced under this moniker. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Macabre+Plaza\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

She is a founding member of indie hip hop groups The Chalice, Grrrl Prty, The Clerb, Ellypseas, and Absynthe. Her debut album, Lizzobangers, was released in 2013. In 2015, she released her sophomore album, Big Grrrl Small World.\r\n\r\nBorn in Detroit in the late 80’s, Lizzo spent much of her formative years in the church, where she was raised on the gospel sounds of The Winans, The Clark Sisters, and Fred Hammond, along with mainstay secular artists such as Stevie Wonder and Elton John. At the age of 10 her family moved to Houston, TX, and Lizzo was exposed to a wide array of emerging Southern musical styles, from the trademark chopped and screwed rap tracks of the underground, to the progressive and polished R&B sounds of groups like Destiny’s Child that were raising the city’s national profile to new heights. In fact, it was after she stumbled across a Destiny’s Child performance at Wal-Mart that Lizzo—then a 5th grader-- was inspired to start writing music on her own. Over the next decade that decision would take her through the trenches of some of the most varied musical genres: R&B girl groups (I.N.I.T.I.A.L.S., Cornrow Clique), progressive rock bands (Elypseas), solo rap ventures, and electro-pop duos (Lizzo & The Larva Ink).\r\n\r\nIn 2011 she made the move to Minneapolis with Larva Ink in order to be a part of that city’s blossoming and collaborative musical community. Lizzo & The Larva Ink was well received there, and the group earned a few encouraging nods from the press. Lizzo was soon introduced to Sophia Eris and Claire de Lune, with whom she would form The Chalice, the three-piece all-female rap/R&B group that would elevate Lizzo’s profile and reputation. In 2012 The Chalice released We Are The Chalice, an album that would gain them instant local success amongst fans and critics alike, garnering City Pages’ prestigious Best New Band and Picked To Click accolades in the same year. \r\n\r\nThe success brought setbacks, though, and a falling out soon led to the demise of Lizzo & The Larva Ink. Feeling discontent with the loss of one group and the hurried blur of success of another, Lizzo was creatively drained from writing We Are The Chalice in two short months. She found herself in the throes of her first full-blown case of writer’s block. Unable to create music for herself, she began listening to several different local albums in hopes of finding inspiration. It was LAVA BANGERS, a 20-track instrumental mixtape from Doomtree producer and Minneapolis music vet Lazerbeak, that ultimately caught her ear. Beaks’ beats proved the fix for Lizzo’s problem. “I sat at home and listened to LAVA BANGERS, and when “Lift Every Voice” came on, my writer’s block was cured,” says Lizzo. “I think it revived my gospel roots. I wrote pages and pages of songs, and finally reached out to Lazerbeak, not thinking anything would come of it.” \r\n\r\nHer timing could not have been better. Beak, impressed with Lizzo’s output with The Chalice, as well as her guest appearances on several other local releases, was looking for a change of pace from his daily Doomtree production and business responsibilities. He immediately signed on to work on some demos. Beat tapes were exchanged, songs were written, and mutual friend and musical collaborator Ryan Olson (Totally Gross National Product founder, Gayngs/Marijuana Deathsquads mastermind) was brought on board to creatively oversee the project. Olson recorded and edited all 15 tracks in his bedroom studio, bringing in laid back hype-man Cliff Rhymes along the way to add even more layers to Lizzo’s dynamic vocals.\r\n\r\nLIZZOBANGERS is the culmination of that four-way collaboration, an album that manages to capture all of the varied musical influences of Lizzo’s upbringing and combine them with the forward-thinking experimental production style of Beak and Olson. The end result is a brave new project that encapsulates the best parts of both the familiar and the future.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Lizzo\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

He gained a following in 2013, posting song covers on the video-sharing application Vine. The following year, he caught the attention of artist manager Andrew Gertler and Island Records A&R Ziggy Chareton, which led to him signing a deal with the record label. Mendes\'s self-titled debut EP was released in 2014, followed by his debut studio album Handwritten in 2015. Handwritten debuted atop the US Billboard 200, making Mendes one of five artists ever to debut at number one before the age of 18. The single \"Stitches\" reached number one in the UK and the top 10 in the US and Canada.\r\n\r\nHis second studio album Illuminate (2016) also debuted at number one in the US, with its singles \"Treat You Better\" and \"There\'s Nothing Holdin\' Me Back\" reaching the top 10 in several countries. His self-titled third studio album (2018) was supported by the lead single \"In My Blood\". The album\'s number one debut in the US made Mendes the third-youngest artist to achieve three number one albums. In 2019, he released the hit singles \"If I Can\'t Have You\" and \"Señorita\", with the latter peaking atop the US Billboard Hot 100. His fourth studio album, Wonder (2020), made Mendes the youngest male artist ever to top the Billboard 200 with four studio albums.\r\n\r\nAmong his accolades, Mendes has won 13 SOCAN awards, 10 MTV Europe Music Awards, eight Juno Awards, eight iHeartRadio MMVAs, two American Music Awards, and received three nominations for a Grammy Award and one nomination for a Brit Award.

His career has spanned over 24 years, during which he has released eleven albums. According to the He\'s a Mental Giant Songfacts, his stage name originated from the TEC-9 semi-automatic handgun, given to him by rapper Black Walt due to his fast rhyming style. (Tech is short for technique and 9 is the number of completion. That\'s why he says the technique\'s complete so often.)\r\n\r\nHis tenth studio album, K.O.D., was released October 27, 2009. He has spent his illustrious career making sure he’s been grinding harder than the average rapper, and is the best selling artist out of his hometown. With nine solo albums and two powerhouse collaboration projects under his belt, the Kansas City MC’s flow is sharper and slicker than it’s ever been.\r\n“This is another roller coaster ride,” explains TECH N9NE about the release.  “When it came time for Sickology 101, I knew I wanted to do a collabo album based on the study of being sick. It’s a beginner’s course for people who don’t know how to be sick lyrically or how to choose sick beats. It all starts with beats because they tell me exactly what to do.” Epic beats from YoungFyre, Wyshmaster, Seven and Matic Lee set the stage for TECH N9NE to weave his introspective and sometimes roguish lyrics around. \r\n\r\nSickology 101 brims with stellar appearances from lyrical heavyweights. On the opening title track, TECH N9NE slays alongside Chino XL and Crooked I, pulling listeners into the Hip-Hop classroom for a lesson in murdering a beat. It’s a twisted vision forged on undeniable grooves and quixotic wordplay. \r\n\r\nThe single, “Nothin,’” is an inspiring, honest anthem that features Messy Marv and Big Scoob. Meanwhile, on “Midwest Choppers 2,” TECH N9NE and Krayzie Bone cruise to the depths of darkness. “Krayzie Bone came through and murdered it,” says TECH N9NE. “I modeled the song after movies. When you do a sequel, there has to be a bigger body count and more people have to die. ‘Midwest Choppers 2’ is Autobahn-style. It makes you want to speed.” \r\n\r\nTECH N9NE’s inimitable flow and rhyming take center stage on solo tracks, including the haunting, hypnotic “Red Nose.” He doesn’t pull any punches on the vitriolic, YoungFyre-produced “Blown Away,” either. It’s an open letter to several prominent urban artists who refused to play before him at radio festivals despite his massive concert draw. \r\n\r\nWith hits like “I’m A Playa,” “Caribou Lou” (which boasts 7.2 million MySpace plays), “Riotmaker,” “Like Yeah” and “Everybody Move,” it’s no wonder TECH N9NE counts a total of over 4.5 million YouTube video plays and an average of 40,000 MySpace visitors each day. His success knows no limits. The July 2008 release, Killer, debuted at Number 1 on the Billboard Top Independent Albums chart and Number 12 on the Billboard Top 200 Albums chart. He did it all on his own. There was no major label — just TECH N9NE’s own record company, Strange Music. TECH N9NE’s tracks have appeared in films like Gang Related and Alpha Dog as well as various TV shows, and he recently made his motion picture debut in The Life of Lucky Cucumber alongside members of MTV’s “Jackass” crew. \r\n\r\nIt hasn’t been an easy road, but TECH N9NE soldiers on and he’ll never stop. “They call me devil worshipper because I’m different. I give you music for my core. They’re the people that put me over the million mark. I raise my middle finger to everybody who judges me because my core audience is there for me. They will always love me, but I’m trying to reach others, too. It’s not over. My music is supposed to be for everybody, but some people just don’t get it. This album is the result; swallow it. It’s middle finger music, all-day and all-night.” \r\n\r\nTECH N9NE never stops bringing that music directly to his fans, constantly reinforcing his status as one of the hardest-touring rap acts in the business.  In 2008, TECH N9NE performed over 200 shows and he doesn’t show any signs of slowing down in 2009.  In April, TECH will head out in support of Sickology 101 and spend two months on the road, performing live for his rabid fans.   \r\n\r\nSickology 101 is prepping the world for TECH N9NE’s next masterpiece, K.O.D. “I want people to know that I’m getting better and better and I’m a machine. I do these collabo albums to give the fans more. This is a bridge record to K.O.D. It’s the farewell to the TECH N9NE you’ve known lately. It’s getting darker. A lot of people might not be able to go to the place I’m going, but this place is my specialty.” \r\n\r\n“I don’t need people to kiss my hand,” assures TECH N9NE. “I’m not trippin’ on status, and I’m not a narcissist when it comes to rap. It’s my heart and soul pouring onto the paper. I write my life and I can’t hold back. This is what I know.”\r\n\r\nOrigin: Kansas City, Missouri\r\nYear Formed: 1991\r\nOfficial Site: http://www.therealtechn9ne.com/\r\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Tech+N9ne\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Seneca is a moving snapshot of his 26 years of life and well-soiled roots in the Appalachian hills, a backdrop that has given birth to some of the most intelligent and hard-working people in the country.\r\n\r\nWhen you partake in his gripping storytelling, it comes as no surprise that Godwin’s shared bills with the likes of Shooter Jennings, Tyler Childers, Colter Wall, Luke Combs, Aaron Watson, David Allan Coe, Sundy Best, Waymore’s Outlaws and Nicholas Jamerson. Godwin is truly at home on stage and alongside like-minded musicians who go against the grain and shake up the status quo.\r\n\r\n“This album will give people a really good look into what it’s like culturally in Appalachia. People have a way-off view from the outside of what we’re all about, what our priorities are and how smart we are,” says Godwin. The record is steeped to perfection in gentle mountain streams and a way of living that is surprisingly universal. Through earnest, sinewy craftsmanship, he mitigates the stereotypes that plague the state and reconfigures expectations.\r\n\r\nAnother essential piece of his story, “Shrinks and Pills” exhibits a dry, sly humor and sees Godwin lament the roar of the open road in his ears and an unquenchable homesickness wedged deep in his bones. He misses the comfort of his homestead, but he wouldn’t have it any other way–heartache be damned. “Hardwood Floors” dazzles in the dim light of a local pub as he shares a tender embrace with his wife amidst the ho-hum of the crowd.\r\n\r\nNotable players include Eric Heywood (Son Volt, Ray LaMontagne & the Pariah Dogs) on pedal steel and Ben Townsend (of Hillbilly Gypsies) on fiddle and banjo. From start to finish, the record is riddled with an abundance of “human things,” Godwin says, like failure, the ups and downs of marriage, and getting back to a simpler way of life.\r\n\r\nHis ideals seep into every inch of his work and stem from humble beginnings of working the West Virginia land and being taught what really matters in life at an early age. Godwin’s father was a coal miner and his mother a schoolteacher. He grew up hunting, fishing, and playing sports, living a pretty traditional homespun life.\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t until much later–after being cut from auditions for the West Virginia University football team–that he picked up the guitar in his spare time. A year later, he could play a full song quite expertly, and he knew then he was on to something. During his 2013 study abroad in Estonia, his frequent rehearsal sessions in his apartment flat drew the attention of flatmates and led to his first-ever gig at a fashion show. “It was really never anything I intended to do,” he recalls.\r\n\r\nBut it was clear this was his destiny. When he returned to the United States and later graduated from WVU in 2014, he realized he had a great talent in singing and playing bluegrass and traditional country music. Godwin soon started touring and playing out professionally, beginning a full-time music career in 2015. He enjoyed a short run in a band called Union Sound Treaty, but conflicting schedules led to lackluster shows and overall unreliability.\r\n\r\nIt was time to branch out on his own, and that’s when Seneca began to take shape. The album, especially in such moments as “The Last Bite” and “Sorry for the Wait,” is an amalgam of influences, running from Creedence Clearwater Revival to Simon & Garfunkel to The Allman Brothers. Godwin’s voice echoes off the weathered but still vibrant Appalachian countryside, rumbling up the peaks and tumbling back down into the valleys, and his heart-torn confessionals are born of the earth itself.\r\n\r\nCharles Wesley Godwin carries his past firmly on his shoulders. He hasn’t been damaged by such a symbolic act, however, and he’s only grown wiser and more aware. On Seneca, he proves to be a fitting ambassador for West Virginia and a people long misunderstood and tragically forgotten. If anything, listeners will rediscover their own wants and desires within the album’s sonic walls and universal themes of compassion, strength, and unity. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Charles+Wesley+Godwin\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The duo went on to perform a stellar rendition of “Greased Lightning” with his buddy in the back of the car, fake cigarette in mouth, sliding down the front of the car, and with detailed choreography to match the racy lyrics. You could say it was quite salacious for the small town of Patoka, IL, population 600.\r\n\r\nThis memory only marks one of the upbeat mid-westerner’s childhood performances. “I’ve loved performing from a very early age. I performed to “Thriller” and “Men in Black” at my elementary school talent show. My mom would make up choreography to go along with the songs. It was great,” recalls Baldridge. “I would take to the dance floor at wedding reception even if no one was dancing just to be able to perform in front of people. That’s when I learned how to win over a crowd. They would all be applauding by the end of the song,” says Drew with a smile.\r\n\r\nStanding at 6’1\", Drew grew up playing basketball and baseball, but would perform the “National Anthem” at all his games. “The high school I went to was too small for a band, but no one thought anything of me being a jock and a singer. I used any and every outlet I could to share my passion with others. The openly Christian teenager joined a quartet at church singing bass while his father sang tenor. Later on he began playing acoustic gigs at a nearby bar on Saturday nights. “My Dad stood by me and my preacher told me Jesus didn’t just preach in church, and I could be that light through my music.”\r\n\r\n“It made perfect sense to become a country artist. I like to tell stories, and singing about where I come from,” explains Baldridge. He recalls his father buying a Dodge Intrepid when he was five years old and the owner threw in a cassette tape with the deal. “Alabama’s ‘Born Country’ was the first country song I fell in love with. We played that cassette over and over. The song rang true to me because my grandpa’s childhood home was just down the road, where the house that his father built by hand still stands.” Four generations of Baldridge’s family have lived and farmed that land in rural Illinois.\r\n\r\n“If you have to describe my music in 3 words, I would have to say it’s fun, real, and positive,” says the singer/songwriter. “I love what Keith Urban says about creating music; ‘We don’t make music to impress, but to inspire.’ I truly believe that you know.” One of his favorite songs he recently worked on is “God’s Front Porch,” which was released on Easter of this year and is featured on Crossing County Lines Vol. II. “What a blessing it would be to be in the presence of the Lord on his front porch.”\r\n\r\nIn 2013, Drew signed with THiS Music, joining the ranks of Nashville’s most prominent and prolific songwriters. He went on to release his debut EP, All Good and his singles “BYOB” and “She’s Taken” became Midwestern radio staples. His new music project, Crossing County Lines is being released in three installments throughout 2015. The first volume was released this past December and debuted at #15 on the iTunes Country Chart. CCL Vol. II released April 7.\r\n\r\nKnown as much as a performer as a singer, Drew brings a rousing, energy-packed show to every opening or headlining date. “I am so very excited for my fans and future fans to hear my song ‘Dance With Ya.’ I went into the songwriting session with this melody in my head, and I said I want something that I could dance to. That’s what we created,” says Baldridge. The tune features a horn section, hypnotic chorus and topped off with Drew’s signature dance moves, “Dance With Ya” is destined to be a crowd-pleaser.\r\n\r\n“I want to build my career the way Eric Church built his.

Playing music influenced by alternative bands and power pop artists among others, they\'re sometimes viewed as a part of the 90s indie movement.\r\n\r\nWeezer started in Los Angeles, California when Rivers Cuomo joined with Patrick Wilson, Matt Sharp, Jason Cropper (who was later replaced by Brian Bell), and their friend  Karl Koch. Five weeks after forming, they had their first gig, opening for Dogstar at Raji\'s Bar and Ribshack on Hollywood Boulevard. Weezer began playing clubs to small audiences around L.A. and recording homemade demos. The group soon received attention from various A&R reps, and the guys were signed on June 26, 1993 by Todd Sullivan, an A&R rep from Geffen Records. The band became a part of the DGC label (which later turned into Interscope).\r\n\r\n\"The Blue Album\"  (1993-1994)\r\n\r\nThe self-titled debut, \'Weezer\', commonly referred to as \'The Blue Album\', came out on May 10, 1994. It picked up considerable acclaim. Tracks \"Undone (The Sweater Song)\" (also known as \"Undone - The Sweater Song\"), \"Buddy Holly\", and \"Say It Ain\'t So” were released as singles. The album was produced by former The Cars frontman Ric Ocasek. During the recording of the Blue Album, Jason Cropper left the band to take care of his future wife, who was pregnant with their first child. Jason was replaced by Brian Bell, a then bassist from a band called Carnival Art.\r\n\r\nThe first single, \"Undone - The Sweater Song\", garnered attention given that Spike Jonze directed the music video for the track. In a single, unbroken take, that video featured Weezer performing the song on a sound stage with various amusing studio antics, including a pack of dogs swarming the set. Jonze also later directed the band\'s second video, which was made for the single \"Buddy Holly\".\r\n\r\nNamed after the famous 50s rock star, the \"Buddy Holly\" music video featured footage of the television sitcom Happy Days spliced with the band performing in a remade \"Arnold\'s Diner\", a setting from the series. The video had heavy rotation on MTV. It went on to win Jonze and the band four MTV Video Music Awards (including Breakthrough Video and Best Alternative Music Video) and two Billboard Music Video Awards. This video was also included as a bonus on the Microsoft Windows 95 CD. The success of the video arguably served as the key for pushing the band into the mainstream rock spotlight.\r\n\r\nThe video for Weezer\'s third single, \"Say It Ain\'t So\", was directed by Sophie Muller. It featured the bandmates playing hacky-sack and performing in the band\'s original rehearsal space in California. A photo of what the band calls the \"Garage\" is featured on the inside cover of the album.\r\n\r\n\'The Blue Album\' is currently certified three times platinum, making it Weezer\'s all-time best seller and one of the most popular rock albums of the early 90s. It was re-released and repackaged in 2004 as a \"Deluxe Edition\". That version of the album included a second disc of B-sides along with other previously unreleased rarities.\r\n\r\nSongs From The Black Hole & Pinkerton (1995-1997)\r\n\r\nIn late December 1994, Weezer took a break from touring for the Christmas holidays. Cuomo traveled back east to his home state of Connecticut. Using an eight-track recorder, he began piecing together demo material for Weezer\'s next album. Cuomo\'s original concept for Weezer\'s sophomore effort was to be a space-themed rock opera, with him mulling over the title \'Songs from the Black Hole\'.\r\n\r\nThe album was intended to feature songs that flowed together seamlessly, and it was planned to end with a special coda that briefly revisited the major musical elements of the piece (something reminiscent of progressive rock works from the 70s). The band began demoing and working on Cuomo\'s concept through intermittent recording sessions in the spring and summer of 1995. Ultimately, the \'Songs from the Black Hole\' album concept was dropped. The album that actually came out would instead feature some old tunes made from before their first album (which had briefly been incorporated into the space-opera) as well as some new ones written while Cuomo was at Harvard.\r\n\r\nAfter the multi-platinum success of their debut album, Weezer\'s sophomore album was finally released on September 24, 1996. Titled \'Pinkerton\', the work peaked at #19 in the U.S. upon its release. It didn\'t sell as many copies as its predecessor, probably due to its darker, more abrasive nature. Pinkerton was labeled \"one of the worst albums of 1996\" by a Rolling Stone reader poll. Eventually, the album grew into a cult classic, and is viewed by some fans as Weezer\'s greatest album. In fact, in 2004, the magazine changed their rating to a 5-star rating and inducted it into The Rolling Stone Hall Of Fame. This article can be found in the Reviews sections of the 500 Greatest Songs Of All Time issue.\r\n\r\nThree singles were taken from the album: \"El Scorcho\", \"The Good Life\" and \"Pink Triangle\". The video for \"El Scorcho\" featured the band inside a darkened room, sitting in a circle, that would be lit differently throughout parts of the song; it was directed by Mark Romanek. The video for \"The Good Life\" was directed by the team of Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris (though no known video was made for \"Pink Triangle\"). However, the singles did not receive as much airtime as the singles from their debut album.\r\n\r\nThe title of the album comes from the character Lieutenant Pinkerton in Giacomo Puccini\'s opera Madame Butterfly. The entire album is heavily influenced by the opera\'s story line. Madame Butterfly is mentioned under her real name, Cio-Cio San, in \"El Scorcho.\" The song \"Butterfly\" is written from Pinkerton\'s point of view at the end of the opera.\r\n\r\nThe album\'s title was the source of a legal challenge. Pinkerton Securities of Encino, Calif., filed a temporary restraining order against the band and its Geffen record label for copyright infringement two days before the album was to be released on September 24, 1996. A judge ruled against the security company and the album was finally released.\r\n\r\nWeezer completed their touring for Pinkerton in the summer of 1997. The members of the band took a break, with drummer Patrick Wilson returning to his home in Portland, Oregon to work on his side project, The Special Goodness, Matt Sharp left to complete the follow-up album for his group The Rentals, and Brian Bell went to work on his group, Space Twins.\r\n\r\nRivers Cuomo returned to Boston, Massachusetts, but dropped out of Harvard to focus on songwriting. He eventually went into seclusion. He painted his walls black, disconnected his phone, and didn\'t communicate with anyone. Later, he formed a solo group, The Rivers Cuomo Band. Cuomo used the group to try out unreleased material, including possible new songs for the next Weezer album. The band played their first show at T.T. the Bear\'s on October 8, 1997. Future Weezer bassist Mikey Welsh was part of the solo band\'s lineup. The Boston songs were later abandoned and not used on the next Weezer album, but live recordings of the Boston shows are openly traded on the internet. In February of 1998, Rivers left Boston and Harvard academia behind and returned to Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nPat Wilson and Brian Bell joined Cuomo in L.A. to start work on the next album. Matt Sharp did not rejoin the band and officially left the group in April of 1998. The group decided on Mikey Welsh as Sharp\'s replacement. Weezer continued rehearsal and cut demos until the fall of 1998. Frustration and creative disagreements led to a decline in rehearsals, and in late fall of 1998, drummer Pat Wilson left for his home in Portland pending renewed productivity from Cuomo.\r\n\r\nThe band would not reunite until April of 2000, when the Fuji Festival in Japan offered Weezer a high-paying gig to play in August 2000. The festival served as a catalyst for Weezer\'s productivity, and from April to May, 2000, the band rehearsed and demoed new songs in Los Angeles. The band returned to live shows in June 2000, but without the Weezer name. Instead the shows featured the group\'s first use of the pseudonym Goat Punishment.\r\n\r\nOn June 23, 2000, the band, now back under the Weezer name, joined the Warped Tour for eight planned dates. Weezer was received well at the festival, leading the band to book more tour dates for the summer.\r\n\r\nSS2K - The Summer Sessions (2000)\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 2000, Weezer (now consisting of Rivers Cuomo, Mikey Welsh, Pat Wilson, and Brian Bell) went on tour. Weezer\'s setlist consisted of 14 new songs that fans have labeled the Summer Songs of 2000 (commonly abbreviated, SS2K). When 13 of these songs did not appear on Weezer\'s next album, fans of the songs started a petition demanding the release of studio demos. Eventually, mp3s were made available on the band\'s official website for download. Three SS2K songs, \"Hash Pipe\", \"Dope Nose\" and \"Slob,\" have appeared on studio albums (\"Hash Pipe\" on the Green Album and \"Dope Nose\" and \"Slob\" appearing on Maladroit).\r\n\r\nGreen Album & Maladroit (2001-2003)\r\n\r\nEventually, the band went back into the studio to produce a third album. Weezer (2001) chose to repeat the self-titled name of their first release. This album quickly became known as The Green Album due to its distinctive bright green coloring. Shortly after the release of The Green Album, Weezer went on another American tour. They attracted a new generation of fans thanks to heavy MTV rotation for the videos of their hit singles \"Hash Pipe\" and \"Island in the Sun.\"\r\n\r\nThe video for \"Hash Pipe,\" directed by Marcos Siega featured sumo wrestlers and was nominated for Best Rock Video at the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards, but lost out to Limp Bizkit\'s \"Rollin.\" Two videos were recorded for \"Island in the Sun.\" Marcos Siega directed the first, which focused on a Mexican wedding, and Spike Jonze directed the second, which involved Weezer with animals in a wildlife reserve. Their video for \"Photograph\" was shot and put together by Weezer friend and unofficial \"5th member\" Karl Koch.\r\n\r\nAs reported on August 16th, 2001, by MTV, bassist Mikey Welsh was checked into a psychiatric hospital. His whereabouts were previously unknown, as he mysteriously went missing before their second filming of the \"Island in the Sun\" music video, featuring the band with various animals. Weezer was prompted to find a temporary replacement for Welsh. Through a mutual friend, Cuomo received Scott Shriner\'s number and asked if he was interested to fill in for Welsh. Shriner, at first believing it was a prank phone call, accepted.\r\n\r\nMuch to the ire of their recording label, Weezer decided to forgo the industry-preferred waiting period of 2 to 3 years between albums and began recording demos for their fourth album. The band took an experimental approach for the recording process by allowing fans to download the demos from their official website in return for feedback. After the release of the album, the band subsequently stated that the process was somewhat of a failure, as the fans did not supply them with cohesive constructive advice. Only the song \"Slob\" was included on the album due to general fan advice.\r\n\r\nThe fourth album, Maladroit, was released in 2002 with Scott Shriner replacing Mikey Welsh on the bass. The album served as a harder-edged version of their trademark catchy pop-influenced music. Although met with generally positive critical reviews (including making many \"Best of \'02\" lists), its sales were not as strong as The Green Album and remains their worst-selling album to date.\r\n\r\nTwo singles were released from the album. The \"Dope Nose\" music video featured a Japanese motorcycle gang, and was put into regular rotation. The music video for \"Keep Fishin\'\" combined Weezer with The Muppets, and had heavy rotation on MTV. Both videos were directed by Marcos Siega.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Maladroit had wrapped up, the band immediately began work on their fifth album, recording numerous demos between tours for Maladroit (often recording as many as 24 songs in a day). These songs were eventually scrapped, and Weezer took a break after the release of two albums in quick succession.\r\n\r\nMake Believe (2003-2005)\r\n\r\nIn March of 2004, Weezer released their first DVD. Titled Video Capture Device, the DVD contains all of their then-current music videos. It also included live concerts and homemade movies. The DVD was certified \"gold\" on November 8, 2004.\r\n\r\nFrom December 2003 to the summer and early fall of 2004, the members of Weezer recorded a large amount of material intended for a new album to be released in the spring of 2005 with producer Rick Rubin. The band\'s early recording efforts became available to the public through the band\'s website. The demos, entitled the Album Five Demos (or album 4.5), were a big hit with fans but only one song, \"Hold Me\", would be included on the finished album. That album, entitled Make Believe, was released on May 10, 2005. The album was very well received by the public. However, long-time Weezer fans often consider it as a decline from their earlier albums, and has received mixed reviews.\r\n\r\nThe album\'s first single, \"Beverly Hills,\" became a hit in the U.S. and worldwide, staying on the charts for several months after its release. The video for \"Beverly Hills\", directed by Marcos Siega, featured the band and a select choice of fans interacting with Playboy Bunnies and Hugh Hefner at the Playboy Mansion. It became the first Weezer song to hit #1 on the Billboard Modern Rock chart. The song was nominated for Best Rock Song at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards, the first ever Grammy nomination for the band. The video for the song was also nominated for Best Rock Video at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards.\r\n\r\nDuring the \"Make Believe\" tour of 2005, Cuomo allowed other members of the band to step into the spotlight of certain songs:\r\n\r\n    * Brian Bell: \"Getchoo\" and \"Why Bother?\" (from Pinkerton), \"Smile\" (from \"The Green Album\"), and \"Keep Fishin\'\" (from Maladroit)\r\n    * Scott Shriner: \"Fall Together\", and \"Dope Nose\", and \"In the Garage\" (from \"The Blue Album\")\r\n    * Patrick Wilson: \"Photograph\" (from \"The Green Album\"), \"Song 2\" (Blur cover, whilst playing lead guitar)\r\n\r\nIn late August 2005, Weezer performed with the rock band The Pixies, which was one of Rivers\' influences, at Summerfest and other dates. From September 8 to October 28, 2005, Weezer set out on a tour with the Foo Fighters, which, to many, was simply called Foozer. The Foozer tour was awarded \"Most Creative Tour Package\" at The 17th Annual Concert Industry Awards.\r\n\r\nOn December 13th, 2005, Winter Weezerland EP was released on iTunes. The EP was essentially a re-release of the 2000 Weezer christmas CD which featured \"The Christmas Song\" and \"Christmas Celebration\". Also, in late 2005 the band released the second single off Make Believe, called \"We Are All on Drugs\" (for family-oriented purposes, some releases of the song were renamed \"We Are All in Love\"), and the music video was directed by Justin Francis.\r\n\r\nIn early 2006, it was announced that Make Believe was certified platinum, and \"Beverly Hills\" was the second most popular download on iTunes for 2005. Also in early 2006, Make Believe\'s third single, \"Perfect Situation\", spent four weeks in a row at the #1 spot on the Billboard Modern Rock chart, a personal record for Weezer. The Perfect Situation video starred Elisha Cuthbert and was directed by Marc Webb. The only other Weezer track to hit #1 was \"Beverly Hills,\" for one week. \"This is Such a Pity\" is the band\'s fourth single from the album, but no music video was made for its release.\r\n\r\nRivers Cuomo announced a new song called \"Piece of the Pie\" while onstage during the band\'s October 7th, 2005 show in Detroit (but did not perform it). Cuomo has mentioned other song ideas recently, dropping titles and ideas such as \"East Coast or West Coast,\" \"Pig\" and new songs with lyrics he described as \"bloggy\".\r\n\r\nRivers has commented on his myspace blog that his recent comments to mtv.com were \'misquoted\' and said that what he meant \"was that the soccer song, \"Our Time will Come\", certainly won\'t be on a Weezer album.\" and said \"The rest of the songs, though, are definite contenders for a Weezer record.\" A strong hint that the band are in fact only on a break and that a sixth album is on the card.\r\n\r\nIn late 2006, Brian Bell began work on a new project called The Relationship which fans can follow on the band\'s myspace page. Pat Wilson told Keifer Wells and Martin Michalek in a radio interview for Andover High School that he and Scott Shriner had been creating songs together and are trying to get Rivers to sing for when the band has jam sessions. Pat has also been creating a few Special Goodness songs, but said little more on the subject. Fans can currently follow the news of the band at Rivers Cuomo\'s myspace page and the official Weezer website.\r\n\r\nThe Red Album (2008)\r\n\r\nLead singer Rivers Cuomo released a demo-compilation album entitled Alone: The Home Recordings of Rivers Cuomo on December 18, 2007. The album contains demos of Cuomo\'s that span from 1992 to 2007, including songs from Weezer\'s abandoned second album, Songs from the Black Hole. Also included in Alone is a song intended for Weezer\'s upcoming 6th studio album, entitled \"This is the Way\". The booklet of Alone tells of the band wanting the song for the album, but ultimately choosing \"an epic, 6-minute, symphonic type of art song\" entitled \"Daydreamer\" instead.\r\n\r\nWeezer\'s \"Weezer\" (also referred to as \"The Red Album\") was released in June 2008. Rick Rubin produced the album and Rich Costey mixed it. The record is being described as \"experimental\", and according to Cuomo, includes longer and non-traditional songs, TR-808 drum machines, synthesizers, Southern rap, baroque counterpoint, and band members other than Cuomo writing, singing, and switching instruments. Pat Wilson said that the album cost about a million dollars to make, contrasting it with the $150,000 budget of \"The Blue Album\". The album\'s singles were produced by Jacknife Lee. Its lead single, \"Pork and Beans\", topped the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks charts for 11 weeks, and its music video won a Grammy for Best Short Form Music Video. The album\'s second single, \"Troublemaker\", debuted at #39 on the Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart and peaked at #2. In October 2008, the group announced that the third single would be \"The Greatest Man That Ever Lived (Variations on a Shaker Hymn)\".\r\n\r\nRaditude (2009)\r\n\r\nIn 2009, the band announced their next album, \"Raditude\", would be released on November 3, 2009, where it debuted as the seventh best-selling album of the week on the Billboard 200 chart. The band scheduled tour dates in December 2009 extending into early 2010 to coincide with the new album\'s release. On December 6, 2009, Weezer frontman Rivers Cuomo was injured when his tour bus crashed in upstate New York due to black ice. Cuomo suffered three broken ribs, and his assistant broke two ribs. His wife, baby daughter, and their nanny were also on the bus; however, they escaped injury. Weezer cancelled tour dates the following day. The band resumed touring on January 20, 2010.\r\n\r\nHurley (2010)\r\n\r\nIn December 2009, it was revealed that the band was no longer with Geffen Records. The band stated that they would still release new material, but they are unsure of the means, whether it be self-released, released online, or getting signed by another label. Eventually, the band was signed to the independent label Epitaph.\r\n\r\nThe album \"Hurley\" was released in September 2010 through Epitaph Records. The name comes from the character Hugo \"Hurley\" Reyes from the television show \"Lost\". Jorge Garcia, the actor who portrayed Hurley, stated that being featured on the album cover is \"one of the biggest honors of [his] career.\" Weezer used internet streaming service YouTube as a way to promote the album. Weezer loaned itself to 15 amateur online video producers, \"going along with whatever plans the creator could execute in about 30 minutes.\" They have used many of the popular channels to promote themselves, such as Barely Political, Ray William Johnson and Fred Figglehorn. The Gregory Brothers solicited musical and vocal contributions from the band on one of its compositions built around speeches by Rep. Charles Rangel and President Barack Obama. Weezer calls the promotion \"The YouTube Invasion\"\r\n\r\nOn November 2, 2010, Weezer released another studio album called \"Death to False Metal\". This album was composed of newly re-recorded versions of unused recordings spanning the band\'s career.\r\n\r\nOn October 9, 2011, the band announced on their website that former bassist Mikey Welsh had died.\r\n\r\nEcce Homo & Everything Will Be Alright in The End(2011–2015)\r\n\r\nRivers Cuomo first mentioned a follow-up to Weezer\'s eighth album, Hurley, shortly after that album\'s release. Cuomo told The A.V. Club, \"I was talking to the producer and he was saying \'These songs sound totally different from Hurley. Hurley was kind of dark, and the new songs sound like you’re 16, riding your bicycle to get a Slurpee.\' As a writer, I had no idea—I wasn’t shooting for anything different. That’s just what happened to come up.\" It is unknown what happened to these songs, as he was not referring to the songs that were written in-between the years of 2011 and 2013.\r\n\r\nIn 2020, upon the release of the digital compilation Alone XI: The EWBAITE Years, Cuomo summarized the period of songwriting (2011-2014) that ultimately resulted in EWBAITE by citing several important life events: The bus accident that had shattered Cuomo\'s ribs, Cuomo\'s loss of his grandfather, a former girlfriend, and his Vipassana meditation teacher. He was separated from his family for five months due to the difficult birth of his son, Leo, during this period.\r\n\r\nRivers Cuomo began developing a concept in 2011, Ecce Homo, deriving a title from the book of the same name by Friedrich Nietzsche. The album concept centered around the character Sebastian who, for deliberately ambiguous reasons, appears to exist throughout various eras of history and, over the course of the narrative, realizes the necessity of faith in a higher power. The album cover would have been the 1474 Antonello da Messina painting \"Ecce Homo\", later used for the fan-club single \"Everybody Needs Salvation,\" and purportedly would have included a fold-out star map and a picture of the Tower of Babel. Several of the tracks from this collection would eventually appear on Everything Will Be Alright in the End. According to a press release for EWBAITE, Rivers Cuomo, after Weezer had put out three albums in only three years, decided to begin writing at a slower pace, composing songs on the piano first before transferring them the to guitar and presenting them to the band. \"I wanted to make a complex, classic album,” Cuomo told Rolling Stone, \"And I knew it was going to take time.\"\r\n\r\nAround this period, Cuomo reconciled with his father, Frank, who left the family when Rivers was very young and later became a Pentecostal preacher (as alluded to in the Weezer song \"Say It Ain\'t So,\"). Said Cuomo, \"Now that I’m a father, I’ve forgiven my parents.\"\r\n\r\nIn October of 2013, Cuomo confided with fans that Weezer would begin working with producer Ric Ocasek in January, and as said, in January 2014, the band started to record its ninth studio album with producer Ric Ocasek, who previously worked with the band on its first two self-titled albums. A clip of a new song was posted on the band\'s official YouTube account on March 19, 2014, which confirmed previous rumors of the band being in the studio. \r\n\r\nKarl Koch had said that \"there are numerous great songs that didn\'t make it onto EWBAITE\". An early contender, \"Everybody Needs Salvation\", was released on a fan club exclusive 7-inch. The most talked about of the unreleased tracks was \"The Rules of Life\", which Rivers had specifically mentioned in a few articles. In Entertainment Weekly, he said of the song: \"Sometimes there’s just songs that are really difficult for me to finish a lyric. The one we may start today, ‘The Rules of Life,’ that’s another one. The chorus is great, but I can’t tell you how many verses I’ve written trying to figure out what my perspective is on that chorus\". Some songs that were not included and not released were \"The Rules of Life\", \"When We Were Young\", \"Hyde\", \"Gravity Will Bring You Down\", \"Flight Plans\", and \"I Need Some of That\". A song called \"Weekend Girl\" was later reworked into \"Weekend Woman,\" which appeared on Pacific Daydream.\r\n\r\nOn June 12, 2014, it was revealed that the album title would be Everything Will Be Alright in the End. It was released on October 7, 2014 to generally favorable reviews, becoming the band\'s best-reviewed release since Pinkerton.\r\n\r\nThe White Album (2016)\r\n\r\nAfter the disappointing sales of the previous album, Everything Will Be Alright in the End, the band left Republic Records and joined Crush Music. A new producer was signed, Jake Sinclair, whom the band met during the recording for Raditude, A self-confessed Weezer fan. When work began for the album, Rivers showed his dropbox account to Jake, which had almost 250 songs and demos. Only one song would make the cut: \"California Kids\", which set the tone and beach theme of the album.\r\n\r\nOn October 20, 2015, \"Thank God for Girls\" was played live at a small iHeart Radio show in Burbank, California. On October 26, 2015, the band released a new single, \"Thank God for Girls\", through Apple Music and to radio the same day. The following week, the band released a second single, \"Do You Wanna Get High?\". Cuomo claimed in an interview with Zane Lowe, that the band was not working on a new album. In January of 2016, weezer.com became a blank white screen and the band\'s Facebook and Twitter pages posted blank white pictures. A video was posted to the band\'s youtube channel that was a white screen with static in the background. On January 14, 2016, Weezer released a third single, \"King of the World\", and announced that the band\'s fourth self-titled album, also known as the White Album.\r\n\r\nProducer Jake Sinclair revealed himself on allthingsweezer.com as user \"wannabeezer\" and began to share insight on the new album. As a weezer fan himself, his goal was to make a weezer album that would change the third album on people\'s rankings. Two more songs were released before the album: \"L.A. Girlz\" on February 16th, and \"California Kids\" which leaked on Apple Music for a short amount of time. The latter was a remake of the 2014 Scott & Rivers song \"California.\" The song was officially released on March 9. Bandmate Brian Bell cowrote the former, \"L.A. Girlz\", and \"Endless Bummer\".\r\n\r\nMuch of the album\'s lyrics come from Cuomo\'s stream of consciousness diary as well as his experiences living in California. Cuomo annotated the lyrics of \"Thank God for Girls,\" \"Do You Wanna Get High?,\" and \"King of the World\" on the site genius.com, \"King of the World,\" which is about Cuomo\'s wife Kyoko Ito Cuomo, was annotated by both of them together. He was featured on the SongExploder podcast, where he detailed the writing and development of \"Summer Elaine and Drunk Dori\". \"Do You Wanna Get High?\" was written about Cuomo\'s girlfriend in 2000, the same subject as \"O Girl\" and \"O Girlfriend. \"Summer Elaine and Drunk Dori\" is about two mothers Cuomo met at his daughter\'s school.\r\n\r\nThe White Album, upon release on April 1, 2016, continued the critical success of the band\'s previous release. In support of the album, the band performed on the Weezer & Panic! at the Disco Summer Tour 2016 with Panic! at the Disco in 2016. The band later signed to Atlantic Records as part of a joint venture between Warner Music Group and Crush Management. The album was nominated for the Best Rock Album Grammy on December 5, 2016.\r\n\r\nOn October 5th, a digital deluxe version was announced to release on the 7th. It contained previously released \"I Love the USA\" as well as the previously announced \"Fake Smiles and Nervous Laughter\" which later received a vinyl release in December. It also includes two new tracks, \"Friend of a Friend\" and a new remix of \"Jacked Up\" featuring Fitz of Fitz and the Tantrums & Nadya of Pussy Riot.\r\n\r\nPacific Daydream (2017–2018)\r\n\r\nSoon after the release of the White Album, Cuomo discussed plans for Weezer\'s next album, provisionally titled the Black Album: \"It’s going to maybe be like Beach Boys gone bad [...] I’m thinking of swearing, which is something I’ve never done in songs.” Cuomo also said the album would tackle “more mature topics” and be “less summer day and more winter night”. He suggested the band could return to the recording studio as soon as October 2016. Weezer delayed recording after Cuomo felt his new material was more \"like reveries from a beach at the end of the world [... as if] the Beach Boys and the Clash fell in love by the ocean and had one hell of an amazing baby\".\r\n\r\nOn March 16, 2017, the band released a new song titled \"Feels Like Summer\", later revealed to be the lead single of an upcoming album. The song drew a mixed reaction from fans but became their biggest hit on Alternative radio in a decade. \"Feels Like Summer\" was heard on The Weather Channel\'s local forecast segments on July 4, 2017, and again on August 18, 2017. It was also heard on some of the network\'s promos that summer. \r\n\r\nOn August 16, the band revealed the album title, Pacific Daydream, and scheduled for October 27. The next day, the a promotional single from the album, \"Mexican Fender\", was released. The following months, \"Beach Boys\" was released, and the month after, they released \"Weekend Woman\" to positive reception.\r\n\r\nAfrica, The Teal Album & The Black Album (2018 - 2019)\r\n\r\nOn May 29, 2018 Weezer released a cover of Toto\'s song \"Africa\" which reached number one on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart in August 2018, becoming the band\'s first number-one single since \"Pork and Beans\" in 2008. On August 10, Toto responded by releasing a cover of Weezer\'s single \"Hash Pipe\"\r\n\r\nOn October 11, 2018, Weezer released \"Can\'t Knock the Hustle\", the lead single from their upcoming self-titled album, also known as the \"Black Album\". On November 21, they released the second single, \"Zombie Bastards\", and announced the \"Black Album\", produced by Dave Sitek and scheduled for March 1, 2019.\r\n\r\nOn January 23rd, 2019 Weezer made a surprise release with a self-titled covers album dubbed \"The Teal Album\".\r\n\r\nDuring an interview with Zane Lowe on the DJ\'s Beats 1 show the day \"The Teal Album\" was released, Weezer revealed they were already mostly done recording their follow-up to the then-unreleased \"Black Album\".\r\n\r\nOK Human & Van Weezer (2021)\r\n\r\nRivers Cuomo has credited producer Jake Sinclair with planting \"the seed of an idea\" for OK Human in 2017. \"Just you and a piano, and an orchestra, and it\'s gonna be super-personal, quirky songs that only you could write, not worrying about commercial potential at all.\r\n\r\nCuomo first confirmed the album\'s existence to Zane Lowe in January of 2019. Said Cuomo: \"Our next album is not on the grid, we’ve just recorded the basic tracks there’s no click, no grid. We don’t have a real title, but the key word we have to inspire us at the moment is ‘masterpiece’. It’s produced by Jake Sinclair who did the White Album.\" Cuomo first mentioned the album\'s working title \"OK Human\" in an interview with the Los Angeles Times published on February 22, 2019, about a week before the release of The Black Album. Cuomo described the album as \"piano-based, very eccentric, with strings already recorded at Abbey Road.\" Cuomo mentioned that his influences for the album were George Gershwin and Harry Nilsson (specifically, Nilsson Sings Newman). Cuomo also confirmed the existence of another project tentatively titled Van Weezer.\r\n\r\nRivers Cuomo first publicly mentioned the album title Van Weezer while discussing the band\'s progress on the album OK Human in an interview with Los Angeles Times in February of 2019, indicating that the album was inspired by Van Halen. When asked about Weezer\'s two upcoming albums in an interview with Billboard published March 1st, Cuomo said: \"One was mostly done before the Black Album. It’s currently called OK Human and was produced by Jake Sinclair, who did our White Album. The other one, I’m depressed thinking about it. I have this huge emotional block. It’s called Van Weezer, and it’s basically a super-rock album. Like the Blue Album, but more guitar riffs.\" Brian Bell acknowledged the album\'s existence in various interviews throughout 2019. In an August interview with Spanish blog Binaural, Bell suggested that Crush Management would prefer to release Van Weezer before OK Human.\r\n\r\nIn August of 2019, a casting call was posted to backstage.com looking for extras to play \"Weezer party goers\" in an upcoming music video. On August 23, musician and producer Tim Pagnotta posted a story to his Instagram page that read \"Jammin’ new @Weezer I worked on :)\". On September 6, 2019, the song \"The End of the Game\" leaked onto the American television music service Music Choice. The song\'s music video was released alongside the announcement of the album Van Weezer on September 10, 2019.\r\n\r\nOn April 9, 2020, it was revealed in a Zoom chat with fans that a single for the album was originally scheduled to be released either that day, or the next, but had been delayed (likely due to the COVID-19 pandemic). Karl Koch posted on the Weezer Fan Club Facebook group asking for footage of people involved in the outbreak, and that a deadline would be on April 15, leading fans to speculate that the footage would be used for an upcoming video. The next day, on April 10, Cuomo mentioned that there would be a Homie song on Van Weezer, as well as a bonus track originally written around 1992. It was also revealed that all the album\'s tracks were fully mastered, with the only track ordering left to be determined. On April 14, Cuomo sang a small segment of the song, \"Thrown It All Away\", during a webinar with fans hosted by Cuomo on the video platform Zoom, for which co-writer Jason Cropper was present.On September 2, Cuomo confirmed via a Riverpedia entry that the 1992 song \"Thrown It All Away\" had recently been recorded with the band. The article was later updated on September 6 to specify that it would be on the album. On September 3, Cuomo confirmed via another Riverpedia entry that \"Sheila Can Do It\" was the aforementioned Homie song appearing on Van Weezer. On April 17, during a Zoom chat with fans, Cuomo stated that the release of Van Weezer had been postponed (due to the COVID-19 pandemic). The postponement was formally announced alongside the release of the second single, \"Hero\", on May 6, 2020.\r\n\r\nAs for OK Human, on April 10, 2020, Cuomo stated on the video conferencing platform Zoom that, at the time, the album was 75% complete. He followed this up by stating the album would likely not be released in 2020. On April 16, he explained the premise to a fan as \"very much a day in the life of [himself], but from a very private place.\" On May 14, Cuomo shared a photo via Snapchat of a studio, with visible sheet music titled \"Dead Roses\". On May 15, Cuomo confirmed in an interview with Mike Jones of the radio station DC101 that the string section was the first to be recorded for the album and that, at the time of the interview, only his piano parts were yet to be completed.\r\n\r\nOn August 13, Weezer formally announced that Van Weezer was being postponed until May 2021, simultaneously hinting that OK Human would release in the meantime, tweeting \"More music coming for you Humans real soon, OK?\" On October 1 through the streaming platform TikTok, Cuomo revealed that the band had a photo shoot earlier that day, later confirming it to be \"for the OK Human artwork and the whole album cycle\". On November 16, Cuomo confirmed to users of Riverchat that the album was complete, adding that the radio mix for the first single was in the mixing process.\r\n\r\nOn January 18, 2021, a new release-date of May 7, 2021 was confirmed alongside the official announcement of OK Human, with a release date of January 29, with the lead single, \"All My Favorite Songs\" releasing on January 21.\r\n\r\nVan Weezer received generally favorable reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 67 based on 20 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine at AllMusic gave the album a positive review, stating \"...any of its retro origins are washed away by big, dumb sounds that keep the record grounded in the eternal now, an aesthetic choice that also helps the album be a rousing good time.\" Erlewin praised the homage to Van Halen on the album. Mark Beaumont from NME was a bit more mixed on the album, whom considered the choruses as some of the band\'s best, but opined that the second half of the album as lesser quality from the first half. Beaumont went on to observe \"there\'s a stone-cold classic Weezer album hidden beneath the fretboard flam.\" Although fans have been more-so critical of this album.\r\n\r\nOK Human received generally favorable reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from professional publications, the release received an average score of 75, based on 21 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Aggregator AnyDecentMusic? gave the album a 7.3 out of 10, based on their assessment of the critical consensus.\r\n\r\nWriting for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote a highly positive review of the album, stating that the album \"offers a singular, complete listening experience unlike anything else in their catalog.\" Similarly, R.A. Hagan, writing for Clash Music, praised the album for being \"more careful, sincere, and delicately crafted\" than the band\'s previous two studio albums, Pacific Daydream and the Black Album. Aaron Mook of Chorus.fm recommended the album, calling it \"a left-field masterpiece that comes dangerously close to reaching the heights of the band\'s early career.\"\r\n\r\nSZNZ: Spring (2022)\r\n\r\nSZNZ: Spring is the seventh EP by American rock band Weezer, and the first of four EPs in their SZNZ (pronounced \"seasons\") project. It was released digitally on March 20, 2022, coinciding with the spring equinox.[5] A physical version was released on CD later the same year, and a vinyl release is planned for winter 2023. The EP produced one single, titled \"A Little Bit of Love\".\r\n\r\nThe SZNZ concept was first revealed by Rivers Cuomo in an interview in January 2021. Cuomo stated that he wanted the Spring album to feature a \"Happy, chill, stress-free\" theme, later expressing a desire for an \"acoustic, breezy\" song in a similar vein to \"Island in the Sun.\"\r\n\r\nOn February 2, 2022, Cuomo shared a Google spreadsheet with fans which included the release dates, possible producers, overall emotion, spirituality tone, planned genre, and planned singles for each of the SZNZ EP. Spring\'s emotion was set to be optimistic sorrow. The spreadsheet also included the band\'s look and the aesthetic era the clothes and EP are based on. Aesthetically, the band linked SZNZ: Spring to a pre-Christian era with influences from Celts, Paganism, and Wicca.\r\n\r\nOn March 16, 2022, Weezer released the lead single, \"A Little Bit Of Love\". On March 16, Cuomo used his game, Weezle (a Weezer-themed spin on the popular web game Wordle), to preview snippets of the forthcoming Spring songs.\r\n\r\nSZNZ: Spring was officially released on March 20, 2022, the day of the Spring Equinox. SZNZ: Spring received generally favorable reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 63 based on 7 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". In a mixed review, Alex Hudson at Exclaim! stated that, while not the worst Weezer album, \"it\'s frustrating to hear them sabotaging their own songs in a futile attempt to pin down the sound of a season. So far, SZNZ feels less like a lofty concept and more like silly gimmick.\" Brady Gerber of Pitchfork was more critical, opining \"unlike the expensive-sounding and often pretty OK Human—and a rarity for any proper Weezer release—SZNZ sounds cheap.\" However, Gerber considered the tracks \"A Little Bit of Love\" and \"Wild at Heart\" highlights of the album.\r\n\r\nSZNZ: Summer (2022)\r\n\r\nSZNZ: Summer is the eighth EP by American rock band Weezer, and the second of four EPs in their SZNZ (pronounced \"seasons\") project. It was released digitally on June 21, 2022, coinciding with the Summer solstice. The EP received its lead single \"Records\" just a few days before its release. Rivers Cuomo described the EP\'s sound as \"21st century 90s\". Aesthetically, he linked the project to 44 BC at the end of the Roman Republic, with an intended emotion of \"youthful indignation\".\r\n\r\nOn June 16, 2022, Weezer released the lead single, \"Records\", on an app called \"Human Record Player\". The app would play the song once the user spins themselves around clockwise like a record player. SZNZ: Summer was officially released on June 21, 2022, the day of the Summer Solstice. Alex Hudson at Exclaim! opined that SZNZ: Summer is their heaviest release, surpassing Maladroit and Van Weezer, largely praising the EP. Hudson, however, added \"The only real blunder is Summer\'s glossy, quantized, computer-made sound; with the raw energy of playing live in a room, Weezer\'s Summer pyrotechnics display might have truly ignited, rather than simply smouldered.\" David Gill of Riff Magazine was slightly more critical of the EP, stating \"Cuomo\'s patented brand of plainspoken emotional vulnerability is still there, but the psychological urgency of The Blue Album and Pinkerton seems to have been replaced by a kind of ironic, almost vocational indifference. It\'s as if, 30 years after releasing some of the most intense and evocative emo rock ever made, Cuomo and Weezer now approach music as a problem to solve rather than a vehicle for their own catharsis.\" In a negative review, Jesse Locke of Pitchfork wrote: \"At this point in their career, Weezer are the musical equivalent of The Simpsons. Hacky, pandering, and decades past their best work...\"\r\n\r\nSZNZ: Autumn (2022)\r\n\r\nSZNZ: Autumn is the ninth EP by American rock band Weezer, and the third of four EPs in their SZNZ (pronounced \"seasons\") project. It was released digitally on September 22, 2022, coinciding with the September equinox. Weezer played one of the songs from the EP, \"What Happens After You?\", on Jimmy Kimmel Live! the day before its release.\r\n\r\nAccording to Rivers Cuomo, the record’s sound would reflect \'dance-rock\' artists such as Franz Ferdinand and The Strokes. He also mentioned the EP would include synths. Cuomo described the project\'s overall emotion as anxiety. The album\'s thematic and aesthetic location was described as being set in \"The Mount of Beatitudes\", with its associated era being passion and the last supper, along with the Salem Witch Trials.\r\n\r\nUnlike the other SZNZ releases, Autumn did not have a lead single. Weezer officially released SZNZ: Autumn on September 22, 2022, the day of the autumnal equinox. A music video for \"What Happens After You?\" was released on November 29, 2022. Rob Wilson at Gigwise described the album as \"an invigorating, emotionally potent update to Weezer\'s catalogue.\"[9] Alex Hudson from Exclaim! was much more critical of the album, saying \"Every musical idea on Autumn is so flimsy that Weezer quickly abandon it and senselessly move onto the next part without the slightest regard for quality, tempo, aesthetic or mood,\" while regarding \"Should She Stay or Should She Go\" as the only good song from it.\r\n\r\nSZNZ: Winter (2022)\r\n\r\nSZNZ: Winter is the tenth EP by American rock band Weezer, and the last of four EPs in their SZNZ (pronounced \"seasons\") project. It was released digitally on December 21, 2022, coinciding with the December solstice. It spawned a single, \"I Want a Dog\", released on December 9, 2022. Rivers Cuomo described the project\'s overall emotion as sadness. Cuomo said that the songwriting would be stylistically similar to Elliott Smith featuring \"lots of loss and despair\". \r\n\r\nWeezer, under their Goat Punishment pseudonym, performed SZNZ: Winter in its entirety at The Troubadour in West Hollywood, California on September 19, 2022. The lead single, \"I Want a Dog\", was released on December 9, 2022, with a live performance of the song on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on December 16, 2022.\r\n\r\nSZNZ: Winter officially released on December 21, 2022 alongside a video for \"Dark Enough to See the Stars\". Anne Erikson at Blabbermouth.net opined that the album \"proves\" that Weezer \"can still churn out music that\'s as strong as their mid-1990s debut.\" However, Michelle Dalarossa from Under the Radar was more critical of the album, stating \"Unfortunately, the combination of Christmas kitsch and Weezer kitsch makes for a grating mishmash of tackiness, angst, and blown-out fuzz that ultimately falls flat.\" Nonetheless, Dalarossa notes instances of \"knack for ear worm vocal melodies and exhilarating power-pop guitar riffs glimmer.\"\r\n\r\nAlbum 20 (2022-Present)\r\n\r\nThe earliest known mention of Weezer\'s 20th album was on September 24, 2022, in a forum post by Rivers Cuomo simply titled \"Album 20\". He simply stated he was excited for the album and asked the community what color it should be.\r\n\r\nOn April 20th, 2023, Rivers Cuomo brought up the idea of doing a musical for the next Weezer album, eventually, this morphed into being a sequel to the scrapped sophomore album \"Songs From The Black Hole\". The idea of a \"SFTBH II\" as it was referred to was workshopped around for a while before eventually being mostly forgotten about in lieu of a more traditional album 20.\r\n\r\nOn August 16th, 2023, Rivers Cuomo posted the names to five demos he was submitting to a potential producer, Klas Åhlund, the songs were entitled: Forget Yesterday, Kids Grow Up, Something Better On TV, CEO, and Black Rain. He described his vision for the album being anti-concept, comparing it to 2010\'s Hurley and 2021\'s Van Weezer. \r\n\r\nThe release date, track listing, or even title for Weezer\'s 20th album is still unknown, but as of now, there is a lot to think and speculate about.\r\n\r\nMembers\r\n\r\nThe band currently consists of the following members:\r\n\r\n    * Brian Bell — Guitar, backing vocals (1993-Present)\r\n    * Rivers Cuomo — Vocals, guitar (1992-Present)\r\n    * Scott Shriner — Bass guitar, backing vocals (2001-Present)\r\n    * Patrick Wilson — Drums (1992-Present)\r\n    * Karl Koch — Historian, webmaster, archivist (1992-Present)\r\n\r\nFormer members:\r\n    * Jason Cropper — Guitar (1992-1993), fired during the recording of The Blue Album in the late summer.\r\n    * Matt Sharp — Bass guitar, backing vocals (1992-1998) , plays on The Blue Album and Pinkerton, left during the band\'s hiatus in 1998.\r\n    * Mikey Welsh — Bass guitar, backing vocals (1998-2001), plays on The Green Album, retired from music after a drug overdose. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Weezer\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

While growing up Kinsley spent her time training in classical piano and violin. She took part in performing in youth orchestras. As Kinsley once said regarding music in her youth,\" it was just everything. It was always there. I think that was part of the reason why I had to do music, in some form. At some point, it just became inseparable from life.\"\r\n\r\nSarah spent her teen years posting covers of popular artists\' music like Justin Bieber and Julia Michaels. Kinsley then took on studying in Singapore until she was contacted by a former classmate, Luc Bradford, that went by the producer name Ford. He had seen her music covers online and was impressed to say the least. Ford looked to make a song with Sarah and ultimately they created the song Craving. This was something Kinsley was proud of so she started sending it to what she\'d describe as her good music industry contacts. She received some conflicting comments where these contacts focused on how small a part she played in the song itself. This kickstarted Sarah\'s interest in becoming her very own music producer. \r\n\r\nWhile studying music theory at Columbia University Kinsley learned that only 2% of producers identify as women. So when she was assigned a project to produce and record several songs she took to it and submitted a song titled Over+Under. Suffice to say she did well in that class. During her time at Columbia University Sarah details the male dominated environment she needed to navigate while learning. Sarah calls out the music industry in saying that it needs to recognize and empower female producers like herself. \r\n\r\nAfter one of the snippets of a song she was writing went viral on TikTok she was ready to release her second EP titled after the viral sensation, The King. This would launch her career into new, youthful eyes capturing the hearts of many around North America. Sarah Kinsley now continues to create track after track and even touring North America to support her latest EP release, Cypress. \r\n\r\nSarah Kinsley states she wants to create, \"juicy, sweet, daring, open, intimate, full songs that have no bounds\".

She later appeared on the TV program Sommarkrysset and participated in the reality series Jag ska bli stjärna in pursuit of an international music career. Managed by Laila Bagge, Larsson traveled to Los Angeles to meet with major record labels, including Universal Music Group, Sony Music, and Warner Music Group.

He continues the momentum with 2023\'s Pretty Little Poison. Released on the heels of his 717 Tapes compilation, Pretty Little Poison positions Zeiders as Nashville\'s newest headliner at just 24 years old.

Produced by chart-topping producers Ross Copperman and Bart Butler, Pretty Little Poison is modern country music at its most heartfelt, created by a young songwriter whose push into mainstream culture has been nothing short of meteoric. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Warren+Zeiders\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Nicknamed \"the Voice,\" she is regarded as one of the greatest singers in the history of music. Houston is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with over 220 million records sold worldwide. She influenced many singers in the recording industry and was known for her powerful, soulful vocals, vocal improvisation skills, use of gospel singing techniques in pop music, and live performances. Houston had 11 number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100 and is the only artist to have seven consecutive number-one singles on the chart. Her accolades include eight Grammy Awards, 16 Billboard Music Awards, two Emmy Awards, and 30 Guinness World Records. Houston\'s inductions include the Grammy Hall of Fame (twice), the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame, the Georgia Music Hall of Fame, the New Jersey Hall of Fame, and the National Recording Registry at the Library of Congress.\r\n\r\nHouston began singing at New Hope Baptist Church in Newark, New Jersey, as a child and became a background vocalist while in high school. She was one of the first black women to appear on the cover of Seventeen after becoming a teen model in 1981. With the guidance of Arista Records chairman Clive Davis, Houston signed to the label at age 19. Her first two studio albums, Whitney Houston (1985) and Whitney (1987), both peaked at number one on the Billboard 200 and are among the best-selling albums of all time. Hit singles from the albums, including \"How Will I Know\", \"Greatest Love of All\" and \"I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\", established her as a catalyst in the acceptance of black female artists on MTV. Her third studio album, I\'m Your Baby Tonight (1990), yielded two Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles, the title track and \"All the Man That I Need\". Houston\'s rendition of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" at Super Bowl XXV in 1991 received widespread media coverage.\r\n\r\nHouston made her acting debut with the romantic thriller film The Bodyguard (1992), which despite its mixed reviews became the tenth highest-grossing film to that date. Its soundtrack won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year and remains the bestselling soundtrack album of all time. It generated multiple hit singles, including \"I Have Nothing\", \"I\'m Every Woman\" and \"I Will Always Love You\"; the latter won the Grammy Award for Record of the Year, spent a then-record 14 weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100 and became the best-selling single by a woman in music history. Subsequently, she went on to star in the films Waiting to Exhale (1995) and The Preacher\'s Wife (1996), and she recorded their respective soundtracks; the former scored her last Billboard Hot 100 number-one single, \"Exhale (Shoop Shoop)\", while the latter, produced by Houston herself, became the bestselling gospel album of all time. As a film producer, she produced multicultural movies and series such as Cinderella (1997) and The Princess Diaries and The Cheetah Girls.\r\n\r\nHouston\'s first studio album in eight years, My Love Is Your Love (1998), spawned several hit singles, including the title track, \"Heartbreak Hotel\", \"It\'s Not Right but It\'s Okay\" and the Academy Award-winning Mariah Carey duet \"When You Believe\". Following the success, she renewed her contract with Arista for $100 million in 2001, one of the biggest recording deals of all time. However, her personal problems began to overshadow her career. Her 2002 studio album, Just Whitney, received mixed reviews, while her drug use and a tumultuous marriage to singer Bobby Brown received widespread media coverage. After divorcing Brown, Houston returned to the top of the Billboard 200 chart with her final studio album, I Look to You (2009). In February 2012, Houston accidentally drowned in a bathtub at the Beverly Hilton hotel in Beverly Hills, with heart disease and cocaine use as contributing factors. News of her death coincided with the 2012 Grammy Awards, which took place the day following her death, and was covered internationally. Her life and career were dramatized in the 2022 biopic I Wanna Dance with Somebody. Her assets amounted to $250 million, earned over a 25-year career.\r\n\r\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitney_Houston\r\n\r\nDiscography\r\nWhitney Houston (1985)\r\nWhitney (1987)\r\nI\'m Your Baby Tonight (1990)\r\nMy Love Is Your Love (1998)\r\nJust Whitney (2002)\r\nOne Wish: The Holiday Album (2003)\r\nI Look to You (2009) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Whitney+Houston\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Filling notebooks and iPads with lyrics, turns of phrase, and poems, the homeschooled artist would spend hours writing lyrics to songs that didn’t exist yet. Sometimes, she’d help her musician father, Ragnar, with melodies and lyrics for songs he’d been tasked to compose for TV shows and ad jingles. \r\n\r\nClaire describes her style as alternative blues-pop, equally as inspired by early influences (like The Beatles’ Help!, Frank Ocean, and the Jack Johnson songs the family would listen to around the house) as it is by the singer-songwriter’s contemporaries, like Benee, Bruno Major, and Still Woozy. \r\n\r\nClaire traffics in lo-fi songs with intricate yet totally relatable lyrics about friendship, crushes, family, and feelings. They plumb the depths of the human condition in very short bursts, exposing the songwriter’s remarkable emotional maturity and strong, singular grasp on her sound. Narratively, tracks like “Tough Guy” and “Seriouslaaay” follow Claire’s stories from start to finish while Ragnar’s clean, crisp production buoys his daughter’s crystal-clear vocals. “He totally captures my vision and if I don’t like something, I’m not afraid to say it,” Claire says of her dad. “Because we’re able to communicate so well, the process happens so quickly.”\r\n\r\nThe “star of the show,” Claire says of her catalogue, is “Backyard Boy,” the final song she wrote for the EP and one that grew legs of its own shortly after release, achieving massive viral success all on its own. “I was getting DMs from people telling me that ‘Backyard Boy’ was doing really well on TikTok,” she remembers. “Then, friends started texting me. Then more people were texting me. So I opened TikTok and I had 300,000 videos under the song and realized, “Oh, this is a thing!”\r\n\r\nSigning to slowplay/Republic Records in 2020, Claire realized the work and dedication she’d been putting into music for half her life was coming to fruition. In August, she shot the “Backyard Boy” music video but kept things close to the family, as she’s done for years (it’s directed by her uncle, the first AD is her cousin, and close family friends star alongside her onscreen). “I think people are connecting to that song because it’s about a feeling you long for, especially during this time,” she says. “Everyone wants to have this experience but it’s something we can’t have right now because of COVID. But ‘Backyard Boy’ makes you feel like you can.”\r\n\r\nClaire has spent a few years drilling down on her craft by refining her songwriting and learning to play instruments like the ukulele, the piano, and the jazz electric guitar (“that’s the one I absolutely enjoy the most,” she says), which have helped her turn her lyrics into fully imagined soundscapes. “I consider myself a writer first and foremost,” she’s quick to note. “I’m super fortunate to be able to sing all my songs, and I want to sing them, but writing is my favorite part of the entire process.” <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Claire+Rosinkranz\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

He was briefly signed to T.I.\'s label Grand Hustle Records and in February 2011 signed to Rick Ross\' Maybach Music Group. He adopted the rap name “Meek Mill” after family and friends from his neighborhood kept referencing him by his middle name. Meek is coined as the latest rap phenomenon to come out of the city of Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nRaised in the North Philadelphia section of the city with his sister and inspired by his mother and father; who died when he was five, Meek Mill began taking the rap game seriously at the age of 12 after losing a street battle to neighboring rappers. He says his desire to rap grew after watching his uncle Philly hip-hop pioneer Grandmaster Nell. While hanging out in his neighborhood, Meek met three guys and formed the group, “BloodHoundz,” which consisted of Mel Love, Dat Nigga Leel and Young Pooh. The group lasted for fives years and Meek ventured on his own.\r\n\r\nWith a solo career in tow, Meek became one of Philadelphia’s hottest underground rap artists on an independent label. In 2007, Meek debuted his Flamerz series, which stands for hottest songs and released his first mix tape, Flamerz 1, which featured the hit single, “In My Bag.”\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Meek debuted the highly anticipated Flamerz 2 –“Hottest In Da City,” which showcased more of his lyrical abilities with the singles, “So Fly,” “Prolli,” and “Hottest In Da City.” Upon release of Flamerz 2, it caught the attention of founder and President of 215Aphillyated Records, Charlie Mack. Mack was immediately impressed with Meek that he signed him to his management company. During the same year, he met the founder and owner of Grand Hustle, TI. TI was impressed with his lyrical ability that he offered him an opportunity to travel to Los Angeles to meet with him along with the Warner Brothers Records, within one week both record companies offered him a deal. Meek was overwhelmed by the offers; however, he felt collaborating with TI was an opportunity of a lifetime and chose his label. An ecstatic Meek was on top of the world; a record deal and the chance to work with one of hip hop’s greatest rappers and then a set back occurred. He was arrested, charged with a crime and order to serve seven months in jail.\r\n\r\nMeek pre-released three singles from his third mix tape Flamerz 2.5 – “The Preview” in August of 2009, which featured the chart topping hits, “Make ‘Em Say,” “Imma Da Ish,” featuring Ms. Jade and “Starting Something,” in honor Michael Jackson. Within the first two weeks of its release, Clear Channel added it to their play list, which is an anomaly in the music business. In June of 2009, Meek began immediately working on his freshman album – Flamerz 3, “Hottest In America – Gangster Grill Edition,” hosted by DJ Drama and featuring the songs: “Baby Girl,” “Hottest In America,” and “I’m Killinem.” The highly anticipated cd is set to be released on January 19, 2010. Despite his stint in jail, Meek’s fans remained loyal, he currently boasts of 13 million hits on My Space and 20 million viewers on You Tube. Meek Mill has recently just signed to Rick Ross\'s Maybach Music Group.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Meek plans to establish the Meek Mill Foundation, which will mentor young males between the ages of 12-24 on the importance of “Education over Incarceration.” He gives a shoutout to the next artist coming up named shizz.. He also plans to collaborate with United Community Action Network and the Lifers of Graterford Prison to address the violence plaguing our cities.

These tweets resulted in a huge reaction from the hip hop community, however, the stunt went awry when Drake (Aubrey Graham) decided to respond. Drake released the diss track \"Charged Up\" during an Apple Music stream and an immediate response from Meek was demanded. Funkmaster Flex announced he would debut Meek\'s response live on Hot97. However, the track never came. After four days there was still no sign of a response from Meek, prompting Drake to release a second diss track \"Back To Back.\" The response to this was huge and a harsh blow to Meek\'s career. Two days later Meek finally released \"Wanna Know.\" This track received largely negative reviews and it was clear to most that Drake had won the beef. On August 2nd at the annual OVOfest, Drake truly roasted Meek Mill; performing \"Back To Back\" in front of various memes poking fun at Meek to a raucous Toronto crowd.

Logan was a standout athlete at Clearwater High School where he won all-state honors as a football player, a wrestler, and as a sprinter. Although Logan started learning the piano at the age of 8 and continued lessons well into his teens, music was never considered as anything more than a warm-up method for the friday night football game. Logan will often joke, however, that Clearwater was probably the only school with a warm up tape playing Montgomery Gentry\'s \"My Town\", and Merle Haggard\'s \"Fightin Side of Me\".\r\n\r\nAfter going on to play college football at Southern Illinois University, Logan picked up the guitar and started writing songs in his spare time.

The CD was a huge hit in his hometown, and all over the SIU Campus where you could drive to any given house party on a saturday night and hear Logan\'s voice and guitar over the stereo accompanied by a few hundred drunk college kids singing at the top of their lungs along to every word. At that point football practice and school unfortunately began to take a backseat to the new found music career. With trips to Nashville becoming frequent Logan made the decision midway through his Junior year to leave school and pursue music full time in Nashville, TN.\r\n\r\nAt the end of his first year in Nashville after working numerous odd jobs as a truck driver, bouncer at Coyote Ugly, a furniture delivery man, and a DJ on a party bus amongst various other odd jobs, Logan landed a publishing deal with, Hit Songwriter, Brett Jones at Wyoming Sky Music.

A singer, songwriter, and producer, as well as a video director, Uchis truly arrived on her own with the self-released Por Vida (2015), an EP that led to a deal with Virgin EMI. By the time Uchis released her lively debut full-length, the Top Five Billboard R&B/hip-hop hit Isolation (2018), she had already been nominated for Grammy awards through her featured appearances on Daniel Caesar\'s \"Get You\" and Juanes\' \"El Ratico.\"\r\n\r\nKali Uchis experienced the majority of her upbringing in Virginia and also spent time in her parents\' native Colombia. As a teenager growing up in Alexandria, just south of Washington, D.C., she learned to play piano and saxophone and also developed a deep interest in visual arts. Her recorded debut was made in 2012 with the self-released mixtape Drunken Babble. Within three years, she had several singles to her credit, including \"Know What I Want\" and \"Lottery,\" typically promoted with videos she directed, as well as collaborations with Snoop Dogg, GoldLink, Tyler, the Creator, and Major Lazer. Following the 2015 independent release of Por Vida, a free digital-download EP with tracks produced by Diplo, Kaytranada, and Tyler, Uchis started releasing her material through major-label Virgin EMI. A DJ Dahi-tweaked version of Por Vida\'s \"Ridin Round,\" issued that November after a move to Los Angeles, was the artist\'s first single for the major label. \"Only Girl,\" a relaxed Kaytranada production featuring Vince Staples and the Internet\'s Steve Lacy, followed in April 2016. She was also featured that year on Daniel Caesar\'s \"Get You.\"\r\n\r\nThroughout 2017, Uchis added to her discography of featured appearances via tracks by Juanes, Gorillaz, Tyler, Bootsy Collins, and Miguel, and she previewed her debut album with the singles \"Tyrant\" (featuring Jorja Smith) and \"Nuestro Planeta\" (featuring Reykon). By the end of the year, \"Get You\" had been nominated for a Grammy in the category of Best R&B Performance, and Juanes\' \"El Ratico\" made Uchis a Latin Grammy nominee when it was up for Record of the Year.

That milestone project followed years of grinding work, writing his own tunes, booking his own shows and recording his own EPs … but it was all rewarded.\r\n\r\nLove and Whiskey hit #1 on iTunes’ Country Albums chart – doing so with zero radio airplay – and since then he’s only poured more gas on the fire. Grow’s 2020 single “Song About You” burned red hot, pulling in more than 50 million streams and getting named one of Spotify’s “Best Country Songs” in the process. Grow’s been featured on Billboard’s coveted “7 Country Acts To Watch” list, and touted by Music Row as a sure-bet for future superstardom, among other accolades, as the temperature continues to spike.\r\n\r\nBut with his new sophomore album, This Town, Grow goes back to where it all started. Painting a sonic picture of the small-town world he was raised in – rocked by changing times but still holding strong – he’s building on success … and letting fans know they’re never alone.\r\n\r\n“I feel like right now I’m making some of the best music I’ve ever made,” he says – and honestly, that’s saying a lot, since the Maryland native is the definition of a “prolific creator.” Since his 2014 arrival in Nashville, he’s dropped three EPs and his milestone debut album, never letting more than a few years pass between releases. But things are different now.\r\n\r\n“2020 was a big revelation to me, of how important music is to people’s lives – even in the worst times,” he says. “To be able to put on a song and not feel alone, even when the world seems like it’s crashing around you, that’s such an intimate thing.”\r\n\r\nCalling his new music the “most-personal” of his career, Grow takes that realization and runs with it for This Town, embracing his journey as proof of what’s possible. Emboldened by success but still inspired by his roots, he was joined by producers Colt Ford and Noah Gordon for 12 fresh tunes, choosing soulful honesty over mainstream conformity. That go-your-own-way, DIY mindset has always been part of Grow’s blue-collar ethos, but This Town takes it to new levels.\r\n\r\nOf the album’s 12 songs, Grow wrote or co-wrote all but one. Three of them were even written solo, as Ford and Gordon pushed him to trust his creative instincts. And then, they went to work perfecting his sound, pumping up his muscular country tone with a sleek new gloss, dripping in county-line soul.\r\n\r\nFeaturing his strongest vocal to date, plus a bold mix of ‘90s country, classic/Southern/alternative rock and even some pop punk, it’s the perfect match for Grow’s writing, with themes as timeless as they are relatable.\r\n\r\n“We’re not the only guys who grow up in small towns and go through breakups,” Grow explains. “But I wanted to make a soundtrack for that kid to realize that someone else went through it, too. I keep saying it but, it’s so true: If you don’t feel alone in something, you can overcome anything.”\r\n\r\nRolling slow like a late night Main-Street cruise, the title track sets the scene. Inspired by real-life emotion, it finds Grow exploring how a home town feels forever changed after a breakup – which is something he knows his fans understand, no matter where they’re from.\r\n\r\n“I couldn’t get these stories without being from a town of 1,500 people,” he says. “In 2020 we did this thing called Backyards and Bonfires and I went across the country to play in people’s backyards, and from California all the way back home, I realized it doesn’t matter where you are. Small towns all have the same people, we all come from the same cloth.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the romantically charged “Song About You” changed the singer-songwriter’s life forever. Built around an irresistible melody and a passionate, heartwarming hook, the track arrived in April of 2020 and immediately struck a chord. It centered on the connection between two people – and the idea that no matter what’s happening outside, love is enough.\r\n\r\n“During that time, all people really had was each other,” he says. “If you were blessed enough to have someone in your life, it was you and them, and that could bring you back down to earth.”\r\n\r\nNow closing in on Grow’s first RIAA Gold certification, the song is not only his biggest hit to date, it’s the proof he needed to take his career to the next level. It led directly to This Town, and everything that will come after.\r\n\r\n“That changes your confidence as an artist, to realize you don’t need to be some guy chasing down radio to get a Number One song, or to get a Gold record,” he explains. “It changed my perception.”\r\n\r\nThe vivid emotional epic “You Ain’t Gone” shows off that perception, co-written with Keirsten Hedden as a pure-country ballad with rip-your-heart out theme. “Whiskey Bound” goes shot for shot in the getting-over-her stage, revealing Grow’s pop-punk roots with distorted guitars, pounding drums and plenty of “F-it” attitude. And speaking of attitude, the patriotic “Kiss My Ass” can speak for itself, a blues-rocking chest thumper that may as well be small-town America’s national anthem.\r\n\r\nPut together, it shows how far Grow has already come, and how he’s never lost sight of his roots. This Town is not just dedicated to where Grow came from, but to the man who put him there in the first place, and the memory-filled “Go Right Now” encapsulates their father-son bond.\r\n\r\n“Losing my dad was one of the darkest moments of my life, and unfortunately I know there’s a lot of people out there in that club, people who feel the same,” Grow says. “I wanted to do that thing where someone doesn’t have to feel alone in that moment.”\r\n\r\nIn case you haven’t noticed, that supportive call to arms is Sam Grow’s renewed purpose as an artist. This Town is just the first step.\r\n\r\n“The big thing is that over the last couple of years, we’ve all had to fight through some stuff,” he explains. “Even the little things you have to go through, they become twice as hard in the world we’re living in now, and I hope people listen and realize that someone else has gone trough it. That someone has come out the other side, and that they can, too. Whether it’s a breakup, or the loss of a family member, or even falling in love, all that stuff. The world isn’t as big as it seems sometimes.” <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Sam+Grow\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Having started his career at the young age of 12, his passion for music being ignited by the media he consumed at the time, especially Dance Dance Revolution. Starting off making music online, he\'d find his way to popularity and eventually hopping on to mainstream music by the end of 2010. After which he started gaining recognition from a lot of artists, notably signing on for the Spitfire EP on to Skrillex\'s OWSLA label and getting commissioned for remixes from Lady Gaga and Avicii.\r\n\r\nAfter making the song, Language, he started to grow tired of the way dance music was back at the time. He started exploring songs in a way he wanted to, ignoring the rules that he used to follow previously set by the norms for EDM. He eventually released the album Worlds with a live show for it with his own vision for it. The album mostly was about the theme of escapism, with every song being a world of its own. Robinson said he wanted everyone to have their own meaning for the songs instead of him giving a definitive meaning or story to every single one of them.\r\n\r\nHe would later go on to collaborate with his best friend, Madeon, on a song called Shelter which would also later get an animated music video in collaboration with Crunchyroll and A-1 Studios.\r\n\r\nFor the next few years, he would release music under the alias of Virtual Self, an alias dedicated to making music that would invoke nostalgia reminiscent of the music from early 2000s video games, with live sets to compliment the same feeling. One of the songs under that alias, Ghost Voices, got nominated for the Grammy Award For Best Dance Recording in 2019.\r\n\r\nHe also hosted his first music festival in 2019, Second Sky (originally named Multiverse) that consisted of artists that he loved. Funds raised by the festival were donated to patients suffering from Burkitt Lymphoma in Malawi by The Robinson Malawi Fund.\r\n\r\nIn January 2020, Robinson would announce his sophomore album, Nurture. As opposed to Worlds, Nurture would be an album about enjoying the existence that we live in. It was a result of his struggle to create music that he felt satisfied with. The singles released all had vocals by Robinson himself in them, the lyrics talking about the different things he had struggled through the past few years, but also standing there as proof that he made it through all of it.\r\n\r\nHe also hosted Secret Sky, an online alternative to Second Sky, similar to it but held online through a live-stream and a digital auditorium.  \r\n\r\nThroughout 2020 and early 2021, 5 singles for Nurture were put out, the song, \"Musician\" also got an animated music video for it.  In January 2021, after experiencing delays due to COVID-19 and due to Robinson wanting to perfect the album, it was announced the 14-song album would be released on April 23rd that year.  A deluxe edition in Japan with an extra song in collaboration with Wednesday Campanella was also announced later.\r\n\r\nIn April 2021, Robinson announced the second secret sky festival with an almost entirely different lineup from last time, taking place on the 24th, right after Nurture would be released. An unexpected final single was released on the 22nd with the album itself being released right after on the 23rd. Secret sky was live-streamed on the 24th along with a VR-based experience available for it.

The promotional (non-album) single,\"I Have Questions,\" was released a few days later. She also joined Bruno Mars as the opening act on his 24K Magic World Tour. New writing and recording sessions for her album were influenced by the success of her single \"Havana\" featuring Young Thug, which postponed its original release date and influenced the change of the record name from “The Hurting, The Healing, The Loving.” to “Camila.”\r\n\r\nIn early 2018 she returned with her debut full-length solo album, Camila, which debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200. It featured production by Frank Dukes, Jarami, and others. Buoyed by the number one single \"Havana,\" featuring Young Thug, and \"Never Be the Same,\" the album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200.\r\n\r\nIn April 2018, Cabello embarked on the Never Be the Same Tour, her first as a solo artist. She was featured in \"Sangria Wine\", a song she recorded with Pharrell Williams. Cabello released the song live during her headlining tour. In May 2018, Cabello made a cameo appearance in Maroon 5\'s music video for \"Girls Like You\" featuring Cardi B. In the same month, she began performing as the opening act for American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift in her Reputation Stadium Tour in between the European leg of the Never Be the Same Tour. Cabello was featured in the remix version of \"Beautiful\", a song from American singer Bazzi. The song was released on August 2. On October 9, 2018, Cabello released the video single, \"Consequences\", having first surprised 12 of her biggest fans in advance, with a \"Most Amazing Mystery Gift & Personal Letter\".\r\n\r\nOn June 21, 2019, Cabello released \"Señorita\" with Canadian singer Shawn Mendes, along with the music video. The song debuted at number 2 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and marks Mendes\' and Cabello\'s second collaboration, following \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\" released in 2015. In August, \"Señorita\" climbed to the number one position, making it Cabello\'s second single to top the Hot 100 chart as lead artist. According to the IFPI, \"Señorita\" was the third best-selling song of 2019 globally. She is also a part of the song \"South of the Border\" by Ed Sheeran along with American rapper Cardi B, released in July 2019.\r\n\r\nIn October 2018, Cabello announced she would start working on new music in the new year after the holidays. In December 2018 she was nominated for two Grammys: Best Pop Solo Performance for a live version of \"Havana\" and Best Pop Vocal Album for Camila. Her performance at the ceremony made her the first female Latin artist to open the show. Cabello announced her sophomore album, Romance, which released December 6th, 2019. It debuted at number 3 on the Billboard 200 Chart and features two collaborations with Canadian singer-songwriter, Shawn Mendes and American Rapper, DaBaby.

When I was 15 I started playing guitar and writing music but didn\'t take it seriously until my Sophomore year of college. In the summer of 2018, leading up to my Sophomore year, my engagement with my fiancée fell through, and I lost all interest in school. I was struggling to heal from the breakup, and I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. It was during this time that I wrote my first song in over a year called I Tried. To this day, I can\'t describe how I felt after making that song. I had finally found my way to heal, and, from then on, creating music was all I wanted to do. Around this time, a producer that I had connected with in 2017, named Dylan Stiles, was sending me beats every day. I would write and record to these beats every night using an Xbox headset and GarageBand. As time went on, we both decided that the best thing we could do was to drop out of school and go all-in on music. In July of 2019, with less than 4,000 monthly listeners on Spotify, Dylan and I moved to Nashville to do just that. After a failed EP, we realized I needed a better strategy for putting out music. We decided that the best thing I could do was put out a new song every two weeks until one caught traction. On September 6th, 2019, we released the first song following this plan called I Lost Myself. Currently, we\'re working on a new wave of singles that I can’t wait to share with you all :)\r\n\r\n- via Munn\'s Spotify Profile <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Munn\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Carlile\'s music has been categorized in several genres, including pop, rock, alternative country, and folk. She released her first album, \'Brandi Carlile\', on July 12, 2005.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning, Columbia Records signed Carlile in late 2004 on the strength of songs she\'d been recording periodically at home. Released in 2005, Brandi Carlile showcased those early songs along with several newly recorded tracks. Shortly after the release of Brandi Carlile, she left her home in Seattle and set out with the Hanseroth brothers, with whom she\'d worked on her earliest recordings and independent regional tours. The tightly knit trio, which forms the core of her band today, spent the better part of two years on the road honing the songs that would later become part of her album \"The Story\".\r\n\r\nIn 2005, she was featured on Rolling Stone\'s \"10 Artists to Watch in 2005\" list. By the end of 2006, Carlile had embarked on several headlining tours and supported a variety of artists including Ray LaMontagne, The Fray, Chris Isaak, Tori Amos, and Shawn Colvin.\r\n\r\nHer second album, The Story, was released in April 2007. It was produced by T Bone Burnett and includes a collaboration with the Indigo Girls on \"Cannonball.\" The album was recorded in an eleven-day-long session with Carlile , the twins (Tim and Phil Hanseroth) and drummer Matt Chamberlain to capture the raw intensity of Carlile\'s live performances. The crack in Carlile\'s vocals during the title track, \"The Story\", came out by accident and was a direct result of the way the album was recorded. Carlile herself describes the vocals as \"technically wrong but emotionally right.\"\r\n\r\nCarlile was exposed to a wider audience when ABC\'s Grey\'s Anatomy showcased three of her songs: \"Tragedy,\" \"What Can I Say,\" and \"Throw It All Away\".

With his breakthrough single “If You Love Her” —a fall 2020 release that marks his Billboard debut— Blakk has brought his heart-on-sleeve songwriting to a whole new level of resonance, again proving music’s power to transform both audience and artist.\r\nStarkly arranged and deceptively simple, the song unfolds with a raw intensity as Blakk pays tribute to a former partner, infusing every line with his soul-stirring vocals.\r\n\r\nWith its intricate detail and lucid self-expression, “If You Love Her” reveals the lyrical finesse Blakk first cultivated by writing poems as a kid. At age 15, he began exploring his musical side by learning to play a guitar given to him by his grandmother. By that point, Blakk had endured a lifetime’s worth of trouble: born in Montreal, he spent much of his childhood with his mother (who struggled with addiction) and his stepfather (a notorious drug dealer), moving around constantly and finding himself on and off the streets after his stepdad went to prison. Soon after moving to Calgary at age 21, he formed a band that later earned a JUNO nomination. In the years following the band’s dissolution, Blakk experienced a period of profound change, ultimately embracing the more soulful and folk-leaning sound that defines his music today. One of the first songs embodying that sound, “Love Me” earned attention from heavyweights like Pete Ganbarg (president of A&R at Atlantic Records) and legendary music exec Seymour Stein, paving the way for Blakk’s signing to Atlantic in 2015. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Forest+Blakk\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The group consists of Irene (아이린), Seulgi (슬기), Wendy (웬디), Joy (조이), and Yeri (예리). Their name is a play on their dual concept of \"red\" and \"velvet;\" the \"red\" half is their brighter and bubblier side, while their \"velvet\" image is their softer, more mature and elegant concept.\r\n\r\nDebuting in 2014, Red Velvet was originally a four-member group. Three of the original four members of Red Velvet were previously part of S.M. Entertainment\'s pre-debut team, SM Rookies. Seulgi, the first member who joined the agency, was brought in through an audition in 2007. Irene, the next member to join the company, was cast in 2009. Joy, the member who wasn\'t part of SM Rookies, auditioned through the SM Global Audition in Seoul in 2012. As part of SM Rookies, several clips of Irene and Seulgi were released on S.M. Entertainment\'s official YouTube account. The three members were rumored to debut as a group in July 2014, which was then later confirmed by SM Entertainment.

Entertainment announced that the group would be making a comeback, and on September 9, 2015, Red Velvet released their first full length album \"The Red\".

A strawberry-blond version of Quincy Jones for the Facebook/Tumblr/post-empire generation, Myd’s a very versatile music-maker, both able to deliver purely functional, club-oriented tracky material, and poppier, regressive house fantaisies. His audio skills give his work a unique 3D coating, a singular, artificial patina. The sound of Myd is something wide and hyperactive, though displaying the compacted, throbbing textures that define the trademark Club Cheval sound.\r\n\r\nMyd’s long-term ambition would be to build new standards for mainstream dance music. Traffic between underground scenes and mass-produced hits having never been so saturated, listeners need artists to act as musical scouts, to filter, sort out, and recompose this data overload, and instinctively conjuring its secret pathways and logic. And that’s pretty much what Myd’s here for. He aspires to become a proper pop producer, a true « music director », and can’t really be bothered with some niche-star status. Working with other artists always had him refine his own personal sound, and helped him use his production tools better and better. Myd’s sound lays on a rich, contrasted aural palette : it’s high-tech sounding, well-balanced, complex yet articulate. It blends Euro techno gusts with tropical siroccos, and an unmissable song-craft with a taste for baroque-ish sophistication.\r\n\r\nSince his first track, « Train to Bamako », one the founding hits of the tropical house scene in 2009, Myd has produced many brilliant, smart remixes, for artists such as Yelle ou Two Door Cinema Club. Then last spring, he came back with the « Octodip » EP – that was less tropical and more focused on occult vocal cut-up work – for new French label Marble, created in early 2011 by former Institubes mainstays Para One, Surkin and Bobmo. As Club Cheval are currently working on their debut album, the future seems clear and vivid for our boy Myd, teeming with previously unheard musical ideas and aural stimuli. And meanwhile, go and check his productions, feel ecstatic, and just imagine what’s up next. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Myd\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

When asked about the rumour that the band\'s name refers to a fire in an arcade, Win Butler replied: \"It\'s not a rumour, it\'s based on a story that someone told me. It\'s not an actual event, but one that I took to be real. I would say that it\'s probably something that the kid made up, but at the time I believed him.\" Win Butler and his brother Will grew up in Texas.\r\n\r\nBand formation\r\n\r\nArcade Fire formed around the husband and wife duo of Win Butler and Régine Chassagne. Joining together as recently as mid-2003, the current line-up solidified in late 2003/early 2004, when their first full-length album Funeral was recorded. Before this an eponymous EP (often referred to by fans as the Us Kids Know EP) had been sold at early shows. The EP was subsequently remastered and given a full release once the band started becoming more prominent. Arcade Fire are known for their enthralling live performances, as well as its use of a large number of musical instruments. In addition to mainstays guitar, drums, and bass guitar, members play piano, violin, viola, cello, double bass, xylophone, keyboard, French horn, accordion, and harp. With several able musicians, the band take most of their instrumental diversity on tour and members switch instrumental duties throughout their shows. The number of instruments, along with a wide set of musical influences has provided a substantial number of resources on which to draw from during the recording process. The promise showed by the band in its live shows allowed it to land a record contract with Chapel Hill-based independent record label Merge Records.\r\n\r\nFuneral\r\n\r\nWithout a major label backing, the success of the band and the album Funeral has been acclaimed as an Internet phenomenon. After a 9.7 rating from Pitchfork, Merge Records sold out their inventory of Funeral and it became the label\'s first album in the Billboard 200 chart. An early tip from David Bowie was also influential. The band booked small clubs for their 2004 tour but growing interest forced many venue changes, far beyond the band\'s expectations, and continued internationally into mid-2005. The MTV2 2005 Review hosted by Zane Lowe named Funeral Album of the Year, and NME named Funeral Number 2 in their list of 2005\'s best albums and \"Rebellion (Lies)\" the best track. By November 2005, Funeral had gone gold in both Canada and the UK and sold in excess of half a million copies worldwide, a phenomenal number for an independent release with minimal television or radio exposure. It has also surpassed Neutral Milk Hotel\'s In The Aeroplane Over The Sea as the biggest selling Merge Records album to date.\r\n\r\nArcade Fire were featured on the April 4, 2005 cover of Time Magazine\'s Canadian edition, and hailed as a band who \"helped put Canadian music on the world map\". On April 2, 2006, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, they received the Juno Award for Songwriters Of The Year for three songs from Funeral: \"Wake Up\", \"Rebellion (Lies)\" and \"Neighborhood #3 (Power Out)\". Arcade Fire then planned to begin recording a follow up to Funeral in the winter of 2005-2006, having bought an old church forty minutes from central Montreal which they converted into a studio. \r\n\r\nNeon Bible\r\n\r\nIn mid-December 2006 www.neonbible.com went live containing nothing more than a phone number, 1-866-NEONBIBLE where people can listen to a new track called Intervention. Built in the style of customer support lines, the number has other features including a contest and a chance to talk to a live person at a specific time each week. \r\n\r\nThen in January 2007, they finally announced that the new album Neon Bible would be released March 5th in UK, March 6th in US. The announcement was made with a video in the album\'s website, with guitarist Richard Reed Parry using a gramophone and a paper mask of Parry\'s own face, and sitting on Win Butler´s chair. After the announcement of the album´s release, the website was updated with a streaming version of \"Black Mirror\", new art and a few phone messages sounding like the band´s members.\r\n\r\nThe Suburbs\r\n\r\nThe band released their third album \"The Suburbs\" on August 2, 2010 in the UK and August 3, 2010 in the United States.

It sold more than 175,000 copies in its first week according to Nielsen SoundScan. It\'s the first theatrical film soundtrack to top the chart since Michael Jackson\'s \"This Is It\" debuted at No. 1 on the list. It is also only the 16th soundtrack to debut at No. 1 in the history of the Billboard 200 chart (those soundtracks include film, television, and straight-to-video efforts).\r\n\r\nReflektor\r\n\r\nArcade Fire and Mercury Records confirmed that they would release a fourth album in late 2013.

The following order is loosely based on the last.fm statistics.\r\n\r\n1. A Swedish alternative metal band including members of In \r\nFlames. Now filed under Passenger (SWE).\r\n2. A Brighton (UK) based alternative folk band.\r\n3. A San José, Costa Rica hardcore/screamo band.\r\n4. A Mesa, Arizona based acoustic rock band.\r\n5. A rap artist from Texas.\r\n6. An old alias of DJ Tiësto.\r\n7. A Chicago-based instrumental rock band.\r\n8. A psytrance project of MFG\'s Guy Zukrel.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------\r\nPassenger  was formed in 1995 by Sten and Engelin. Both members wanted to do something that was not Thrash metal or Melodic death metal unlike the bands they played in. At its early stages the band was originally called \"Cliff\". Under the name Cliff they recorded two demos in Studio Fredman that were never released. After a break in the band and after Engelin was hired as a session guitarist for In Flames\' Whoracle tour, Anders Fridén, the vocalist of In Flames showed interest in Passenger and joined the band.\r\n\r\nIn the year 2000 the band came back from its break and went on to record a demo. In 2001 the band recorded another demo in which early versions of the songs \"Used\", \"In My Head\", \"Circus\" and \"Drowning City\" were recorded. After a third demo the band finally recorded and released their debut album entitled Passenger. A video for \"In Reverse\" was also released.\r\n\r\nSten noted in February 2004 on their official website that they were in the process of recording their second album. However, since then, Fridén, lead vocalist of both Passenger and In Flames has been noted saying that he has very little time for the project, due to other commitments, and the group is currently on hold. In an interview with Fridén he stated that as soon as he gets a break from In Flames, he wants to get all the group together to record a second album for early 2010. This did however not happen as Anders continued touring with In Flames until October 2010 when they entered their studio to record their next album.\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe brainchild of 26-year-old Brighton born singer/songwriter Mike Rosenberg, Passenger is redefining the troubadour for the 21st century. Formerly a five-piece band, Passenger has now pared back to basics, quite literally bringing music to the streets on a series of lengthy busking journeys across Australia, America and the United Kingdom. A classic journeyman musician, cut from the same mould as Van Morrison, Neil Young and John Prine, Passenger has the unique ability to move from the humorous to heartbreaking with every song.\r\n\r\nAfter a year spent crisscrossing the UK and US with his debut album Wicked Man’s Rest, Passenger’s markedly stripped down and soulful second album Wide Eyes Blind Love was brought to the public as it was created: on the road. Setting up on street corners across the UK and Australia, Passenger halted passers by in their hundreds; all connecting to the mellifluous tones and powerfully hewn lyrics emanating from this lone figure and his guitar. This is music as Passenger means it to be, unvarnished and honest, just pure talent and powerful tunes that tap straight into the heart of the crowd.\r\n\r\nStruck by the dynamic freedom of the troubadour life, Passenger developed the grass roots method of Wide Eyes Blind Love into the germ of a new album. Impressively and entirely self funded through busking income, Passenger set about recording a series of collaborations with musical friends met along the way. Flight Of The Crow is the remarkable result of Passenger’s intrepid journey, with Australian artists Lior, Josh Pyke, Katie Noonan, Boy & Bear, Kate Miller Heidke, Philadelphia Grand Jury, Brian Campeau and Elana Stone, Matt Corby, Jess Chalker and Dead Letter Chorus all lending their voices to this serendipitous creative venture. Flight Of The Crow was recorded in Sydney’s famous BJB studios over February and March of 2010, and co-produced by Berkfinger (AKA Simon Berkleman from Philadelphia Grand Jury).\r\n\r\nAs a second album born of the road, Flight Of The Crow speaks to the compelling quality of Passenger’s music and the striking sincerity of his lyrics, both of which are matched by his dedication to this grass roots style of craftsmanship and collaboration. How utterly remarkable that a lone musician can travel the globe, and literally from the street, connect with some of Australia’s finest musical talents to produce a self-funded album. This is the stuff of legend, with Passenger clearly evoking the humble, hardworking creativity of the troubadours of old. \r\nwww.myspace.com/passengerofficial\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nPassenger or PSNGR is an active hardcore/screamo band formed in San José, Costa Rica born in 2004.

They have a large archive of both original music and cover songs. They released their first pressed album, entitled \"Four Letter Word\", in September 2004 on indie label Crop Circle Records.\r\n\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nPassenger is an Austin, Texas based MC. Born in Massachusetts, he spent most of his younger days growing up in New York and Houston, Tx eventually moving to Austin, Tx in 1996 attending college to try his hand as a sound engineer. During these years, his musical versatility had him playing bass in an alternative rock band, singing in another side project, DJing house, jungle and hip hop music at various venues in Austin. Eventually he became a full time DJ for the reggae/ska/hiphop/punk band, Indofin, which he was a member for years touring the country. His love for hip hop provoked him to purchase an MPC and has been making beats and rhyming ever since. \"The Brick In A Glass House\", his debut album, contains production from Nozebleed, Lazerbeak (Doomtree), amongst others as well as his own and has guests from Austin\'s own Emcee, Justin Cook, Weezel, as well as a few others. Currently, you can find him playing shows around the Austin area and will begin to venturing out to other Texas cities. He is also working on putting together a live band to back him at shows and working on new material.\r\n\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nPassenger is also an old alias of DJ Tiësto. Tiësto only produced 2 tracks under his old Passenger-alias: \"Blackspin\" and \"F.A.H.\", both appearing on a record released on Momentum Records in 1996.\r\n\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nPassenger began winter of 2002 when guitarist dustin covert and bassist/vocalist david mata collaborated on the bands first full length \"alive\" an 8 song full length about a disoriented and dark but intriguing view of love and romance. the album explored dissonant melodies and agonizingly slow chord progressions with the use of mark sampson on drums and sam billen on piano. in 2003 passenger progressed to a four person line up with michael oberlin on drums and james demis on keyboards and sound and began to play various rock venues in chicago, illinois and used silent film to accompany their live performance. numerous line-up changes took effect during the next year and a half, but in 2005 the concrete line-up of Dustin Covert and David D\'Antonio on guitars, David Mata on Bass and Samuel Vincent on drums was achieved. In winter of 2005 Passenger recorded \"The Owls are Restless\", a 2 hour and 40 minute concept record about an ancient war between owls and rabbits and was recorded and engineered by Steve Whitney in a warehouse in Aurora, Illinois. Shortly after the recording drummer Samuel Vincent tragically passed away. Without his talent and with the grief of losing a dear, dear friend the band decided it was impossible to continue performing the material or anything that involved Passenger. These unfortunate events occurred before \"The Owls are Restless\" was able to achieve any sort of record label attention, and when it finally did it was too late. The remaining musicians have continued creating in their band White Devil, named after the vintage moog synth/organ that Sam would play in collaboration with his drums in Passenger.  \r\nmyspace.com/whitedevilchicago <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Passenger\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

She also auditioned for Les Misérables without telling her parents, and was offered a part. It was a risk that paid off, as it served to open her parents\' eyes to her singing ability. Aside from West End commitments, the intervening years between her days as a child star and the advent of her career as a pop singer were spent becoming a world karate champion no fewer than three times, an art form she credited with teaching her discipline and focus, two essential traits of becoming a successful musician.\r\n\r\nAfter a chance meeting with an aspiring singer/songwriter, she managed to secure some studio time in Elton John\'s Rocket Studios, and, after hearing what she could do, she was subsequently picked up by Elton\'s management company Rocket Music. Anne-Marie released a demo in 2013 entitled Summer Girl, which drew some attention to the singer, most notably garnering a fan in Ed Sheeran. Despite the encouraging start to her solo career, things were put on hold to give her more time to develop as an artist.\r\n\r\nHaving guested on tracks by dubstep supergroup Magnetic Man, London-based garage duo Gorgon City, and progressive house trio Raized by Wolves, Anne-Marie caught the attention of Brit and MOBO award winners Rudimental. She was featured alongside Dizzee Rascal and Will Heard on two tracks from their second album, 2015\'s We the Generation, and spent two years touring with the band, playing some of the world\'s biggest stages and best-known festivals.\r\n\r\nThe summer of that year also saw the release of Anne-Marie\'s debut EP on Rudimental\'s then-new record label, Major Tom\'s. The aptly titled Karate EP featured three tracks and a Chloe Martini remix, and producers Josh Record and Two Inch Punch worked with her on the record. Both the lead single \"Karate,\" a slick fusion of electro-grime and R&B, and the follow-up \"Gemini,\" garnered some very positive reviews and led Anne-Marie to gigging as a solo artist. In early 2016, the single \"Do It Right\" reached the U.K. charts, and several months later \"Alarm\" hit the Top 40 in several charts around the world.\r\n\r\nIn 2017, Anne-Marie scored a hit single when she featured on Clean Bandit\'s multi-platinum \"Rockabye\" with Sean Paul. The song topped the charts across Europe and in Australia, breaking into the Top Ten in Canada and the U.S. She followed with the solo singles \"Ciao Adios\" and \"Heavy,\" which both charted in the U.K. and Ireland. Both tracks appeared on her debut full-length, Speak Your Mind, which saw release in April 2018.

However, the vision of each of them has not changed that much as they have become an international band and they claim to keep their feet very firmly on the ground, as, in their words, it is always a work in progress. Despite this, there are still achievements to unlock, one of which is playing Madison Square Garden, one of their favourite venues.\r\n\r\nThe members are Parisians except for Benguigui, who is originally from Avignon and studied jazz. Keyboardist Charles de Boisseguin started the project solo until he met the other keyboardist, Hagni Gwon, who in turn called in bassist David Gaugué and drummer Tom Daveau. Soon after, guitarist Achille Trocellier and Benguigui joined, and the group was officially formed in 2012.\r\n\r\nTheir pop, funk and electronic sounds, Flore\'s sweet tone singing in French, coupled with a retro yet futuristic aesthetic, broke the language barrier and took them to stages they could never have imagined. After albums and EPs such as \"Sonate Pacifique\", \"Odyssée\", \"Vanille Fraise\" and \"Matahari\", their most recent album is 2021\'s \"Tako Tsubo\", with songs in English and French, whose title alludes to the Japanese term for octopus traps and broken heart syndrome.\r\n\r\nPeople with \"broken heart syndrome have a heart shaped like an octopus trap,\" Gwon explained.\r\n\r\nL\'Impératrice\'s retro pop and disco music places them as heirs to the French Touch trend pioneered by Daft Punk, to whom they have paid homage in their music videos, and represented by groups such as Air and Phoenix.

Denning has previously headlined his own “Heartbeat Of A Small Town Tour,” toured with Cole Swindell, Dustin Lynch, Alan Jackson, Riley Green, Dierks Bentley and Jake Owen. With almost 700 Million streams worldwide, Denning has been spotlighted for his head-turning sound and was previously selected as one of CRS New Faces, an Opry NextStage recipient and a CMA KixStart Artist, as he makes his mark within the industry. \r\n\r\nDenning was born on December 1, 1992 in Warner Robins, Georgia.

After moving to Nashville, Tennessee in 2014, he got a publishing deal with RED Creative Group, which led to him writing songs for Jason Aldean, Justin Moore, and Chase Rice among others.

The following month, it reached #1 after 65 weeks on the chart, also setting a record for the slowest ascent to the top.\r\n\r\n\"David Ashley Parker from Powder Springs\" is based on Denning\'s real-life experiences with identity document forgery when he was underaged, and David Ashley Parker is a real person whose identity Denning used to buy beer and cigarettes when he was not old enough to do so legally.

He is acclaimed by critics and musicians, particularly for his work during the 1970s, and his lasting impact on the music industry. John\'s music and showmanship have had a significant impact on popular music. His songwriting partnership with Taupin is one of the most successful in history.\r\n\r\nJohn was raised in the Pinner suburb of London and learned to play piano at an early age, forming the blues band Bluesology in 1962. After leaving Bluesology in 1967 to embark on a solo career, John met Taupin after they both answered an advert for songwriters. For two years, they wrote songs for other artists, and John worked as a session musician for artists. John released his debut album Empty Sky in 1969, and a year later formed the Elton John Band and released his first hit single, \"Your Song\".\r\n\r\nJohn\'s critical success was at its peak in the 1970s when he released a streak of chart-topping albums in the US and UK, which began with Honky Château (1972) and culminated with Rock of the Westies (1975). John continued his success in the 1980s and 1990s, having several hit singles and albums in both decades, and has continued to record new music since then. He has also had success in musical films and theatre, composing music for The Lion King, Aida, and Billy Elliot the Musical.

Her musical style encompasses country, soul, rock and blues.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, King released her debut EP \"The Elle King EP\" on RCA; one track from that EP, \"Playing for Keeps\", is the theme song for VH1\'s Mob Wives Chicago series.\r\n\r\nShe released her debut album \"Love Stuff\" in 2015. It produced the US top ten single \"Ex\'s & Oh\'s\", which earned her two Grammy Award nominations. King has also toured with acts such as Of Monsters and Men, Train, James Bay, The Chicks, Heart, Joan Jett, Michael Kiwanuka, and Miranda Lambert. She is the daughter of actor and comedian Rob Schneider and former model London King. King uses her mother\'s surname to distinguish her career and identity from her father\'s. \"People know who my dad is,\" she told ABC News, \"but I think that my voice and my music speaks for itself: that I am my own person.\"\r\n\r\nKing is a four-time Grammy Award nominee, two each in the rock and country categories, and received honors from the Country Music Association Awards and the Academy of Country Music Awards.\r\n\r\nKing was born on July 3, 1989 in Los Angeles, California, to then-Saturday Night Live cast member Rob Schneider and London King, a former model. Her parents divorced and her mother remarried. She grew up living in Ohio, between Wellston and Columbus. When she was nine, her stepfather, Justin Tesa, gave her a record by all-female hard-rock band the Donnas; she views this as the pivotal moment when she decided she wanted to be a musician. Around this time, she also started listening to the Runaways and Blondie, and she made her acting debut alongside her father in the movie Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo.\r\n\r\nAt the age of 13, King started playing guitar, immersing herself in the music of Otis Redding, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Etta James, Aretha Franklin, Al Green, Hank Williams, Johnny Cash, AC/DC (she has the phrase \"dirty deeds\" tattooed on her biceps), and Earl Scruggs. Her interest in the country and bluegrass of Hank Williams and Earl Scruggs inspired her to learn the banjo. During her teenage years, she attended Buck\'s Rock camp in Connecticut, where she starred successfully in a number of musicals.\r\n\r\nKing spent her teenage years in New York City, but she has also lived in Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and Copenhagen, Denmark. Upon graduating from Elisabeth Irwin High School/Little Red School House, she moved to Philadelphia to enroll at University of the Arts, studying painting and film. During these college years, she had an artistic epiphany seeing a live show where the band onstage used a banjo purely for accompaniment purposes, eschewing the bluegrass and country musical vocabulary traditionally associated with the instrument. King then began to use the banjo as a compositional tool. After college, she briefly lived in Copenhagen and Los Angeles, before moving back to New York where she currently resides in Bushwick, Brooklyn.\r\n\r\nIn September 2014, King released \"Ex\'s & Oh\'s\", which serves as the lead single off her debut album. She released the album, Love Stuff on February 17, 2015. She performed \"Ex\'s & Oh\'s\" the next day on The Today Show to promote it. The song reached number 10 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming King\'s first top ten single in the United States. \"Ex\'s & Oh\'s\" received two nominations at the 58th Grammy Awards: Best Rock Performance and Best Rock Song. In July 2015, King supported Modest Mouse on their UK tour. \"Under the Influence\" and \"America\'s Sweetheart\" were later released as singles for rock radio and mainstream radio, respectively. In 2016, her single \"Good Girls\" featured on the Ghostbusters soundtrack and played over the movie\'s credits. In 2016, she teamed up with country singer Dierks Bentley for the song \"Different for Girls\". They performed this song at the 50th CMA Awards on November 2, 2016, when she and Bentley won the award for Musical Event of the Year.\r\n\r\nOn March 6, 2017, she premiered a new single \"Wild Love\" featuring a sparse electronic production, marking a slight departure from her previous style in music.\r\n\r\nKing released her second studio album \"Shake the Spiri\", on October 19, 2018, which she made with her band the Brethren. On August 3, 2019, she was featured singing on a version of Lindsey Stirling\'s \"The Upside\". Throughout 2019, King served as a guest co-host on the MTV series Catfish: The TV Show opposite lead host Nev Schulman.\r\n\r\nIn 2021, it was revealed she was pregnant with her first child with tattoo artist Dan Tooker. On September 1, 2021, she welcomed a baby boy. King has several tattoos, and worked at a tattoo company called East Side Ink. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Elle+King\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The original lineup consisted of lead vocalist Jacoby Shaddix, guitarist Jerry Horton, drummer Dave Buckner, bassist Will James, and trombonist Ben Luther.\r\n\r\nAfter two EPs, James left and was replaced by Tobin Esperance. The band independently released two more EPs before signing with DreamWorks Records in 1999, subsequently releasing the triple-platinum Infest in 2000, the gold album Lovehatetragedy in 2002 and the platinum album Getting Away with Murder in 2004. A year after The Paramour Sessions, Buckner left in 2007, and was replaced by Tony Palermo. Papa Roach then made Metamorphosis (2009), Time for Annihilation (2010), The Connection (2012), F.E.A.R. (2015), Crooked Teeth (2017) and Who Do You Trust? (2019). The group\'s eleventh studio album, Ego Trip, was released on April 8, 2022.\r\n\r\nPapa Roach\'s formation began in January 1993, when lead singer Jacoby Shaddix and drummer Dave Buckner met on the Vacaville High School football field. They were later joined by lead guitarist Jerry Horton from nearby Vanden High School, rhythm guitarist Anne Mikolajcik, trombonist Ben Luther and bassist Will James. They decided to enter the school\'s talent show, performing a version of Jimi Hendrix\'s song \"Fire\". They ultimately ended up losing the talent show. In March 1993, Ben Luther left the band, and Anne Mikolajcik left as well. At this point, Papa Roach was practicing every day and touring, playing every gig it could get. The band\'s first tour van was called Moby Dick, from which Shaddix was inspired to come up with his first stage name \"Coby Dick\". Initially, the band was called \"Papa Gato\" as suggested by Buckner but Shaddix changed it to Papa Roach, mixing up the nickname of his grandfather from his mother\'s side —Herbert Fischer \"Papa\"— and \"Roach\" coming from his grandfather from his father\'s side, John \"Grandpa\" Roatch. Both grandparents were musicians.\r\n\r\nPapa Roach has been described as alternative rock, nu metal, alternative metal, rap metal, hard rock, rap rock, punk rock,  pop rock, and rapcore. The band also utilizes elements of pop, electronic, and hip hop. The band started as a hardcore punk band. In their early independent releases and on their first two major label albums, Infest and Lovehatetragedy, the band tended to use nu metal and rap metal. Before Papa Roach released their major label albums, Jacoby Shaddix\'s singing style was compared to Chino Moreno and Lynn Strait of Snot. Additionally, with their 2009 album, Metamorphosis, as the name expresses, the band felt that their music was going through a transformation to \"stuff that\'s...harder and faster\". AllMusic has compared the band\'s recent work to 1980s glam metal, Allmusic staff writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote \"At the close of the 2000s, the quartet has shed the rap and the angst, ditching all the alt-metal accoutrements to become a knowing update of an \'80s Sunset Strip sleaze rock outfit.\" With the release of F.E.A.R., both MetalSucks and Metal Injection noted that the band has acquired some djent influences.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, frontman Jacoby Shaddix said the following in an interview with the Dallas Music Guide regarding the band no longer using rapping in their music: \"...the rapping\'s gone! I don\'t feel like rapping. I\'m just over that...I just want to be a rocker. It\'s what I wanted to be when I was a kid\". Shaddix has added this remark in another interview: \"We\'re a band that tries to walk that line between metal, hardcore, punk rock and pop music, and we do our best at trying to make it all cool\".\r\n\r\nPrior to the release of The Connection, guitarist Jerry Horton said in an interview by VerdamMnis Magazine that \"It\'s kind of a natural thing for us, we\'ve always been changing throughout the years. Of course, there are some things that stay the same in our sound but we do like to try new things to sort of stretch out a little bit our basis and therefore make it more interesting\". He also said that the band was going to explore \"electronic sounds for the next record\".\r\n\r\nThe band\'s influences include Faith No More, Social Distortion, Metallica, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Wu-Tang Clan, Fugees, Refused, Queen, and Led Zeppelin. Jacoby Shaddix acknowledges Faith No More\'s Mike Patton and Social Distortion\'s Mike Ness as major influences, stating that \"the way that I sing, I definitely was inspired by Mike Patton\", \"but I like the storytelling that Mike Ness does so I kind of fused both those two guys together at an early age, and it inspired me to become my own thing.\"\r\n\r\nIn the beginning, Papa Roach\'s biggest influence was experimental band Mr. Bungle (fronted by Mike Patton from Faith No More), which was reflected in the adventurousness of their 1994 debut release Potatoes for Christmas.\r\n\r\nIn a 2021 interview, Jacoby Shaddix reflected about the band\'s long-held association with the nu metal genre, saying \"I love being one of the forefathers of nu metal, that\'s dope, but we\'ve been able to outlive it and celebrate it at the same time\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Papa+Roach\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Teenage guitar strangler John Zinrich, a.k.a. Johnny Fettish (so called because he had a thing for biting women\'s knees under tables, hence \"John Knee Fetish\"), had previously lived out the punk ideal by dropping out of high school at age 15 to join Public Enemy, noted in Cle 3.0 for doing \"the fastest version ever attempted of \'I Wanna Be Your Dog\'.\" Striving for a poppier sound, Fettish and his suburban neighbor Vic Halm penned a series of power-punk pop gems and entered the first national \"Battle of the Garages\" competition run by Bomp/Voxx honcho Greg Shaw. The \'Bats contributed a track, \"The Reason Why\" to the first \"Battle\" compilation and played on the national \"Battle\" tour in 1981. Positive public reaction won them a recording contract, and between 1981 and 1984 the \'Bats released two singles and an album, \"Zontar Must Die!\" on Bomp/Voxx. They also played various notable East Coast and local venues, including the first WRUW Studio Arama show and the opening night of the Lakefront (which displayed \"Wombats\" on its curb sign for several years as a result). Their energetic live show was notable for speedy fuzzy guitars pumped through Marshall stacks, unintelligible vocals, and the sight of 5\'4\" Fettish leaping two feet in the air, against a backdrop of six-foot-tall John Lennon-lookalike Halm and equally towering bassist Tim Ratley. In 1984 the Wombats played a show with the seminal Columbus band Great Plains, who brought them to the attention of Gerard Cosloy at Homestead Records. The Wombats subsequently recorded one EP for Homestead, \"Mudpuddles\", which came out in 1985. Unfortunately, the band had a falling out with Cosloy over their inability to tour, since drummer Tommy Edwards was busy studying to be a refrigerator repairman. As a result, promotion for \"Mudpuddles\" was almost nil and the \'Bats found themselves once again without a label. In 1986, Fettish and Halm wrote and recorded some excellent demos for a third album which they hoped to place on a major label, but due to lack of interest this project never saw the light of day. Since then, the \'Bats have played sporadically around Cleveland with various lineups. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Wombats\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

All in one day.\r\n\r\n“That was our first little taste of what that process could be like,” says Matthew Ramsey, lead singer for the chart-topping country band who to date has notched eight No. 1 singles at country radio, surpassed one billion on-demand streams, earned several Platinum and Gold single certifications and headlined arenas and amphitheaters around the globe. “We always thought ‘Man, that would be really cool to make an entire album like that.””\r\n\r\nRecently, Old Dominion got their long-awaited chance to do exactly that: for the entirety of what became their stunning fourth studio album, Time, Tequila and Therapy, Old Dominion — which includes multi-instrumentalist Trevor Rosen, lead guitarist Brad Tursi, bassist Geoff Sprung and drummer Whit Sellers — hunkered down in an Asheville, North Carolina studio, and wrote and recorded the entire LP in a multi-week stretch. To hear them now relive those thrilling few weeks, the experience was nothing short of life-affirming.\r\n\r\nAsk Ramsey about how important this time spent together was and, in turn, why Time, Tequila and Therapy is a true turning point for Old Dominion, and he doesn’t mince words. “I think it probably saved us as a band, honestly,” Ramsey offers of the album, produced by longtime collaborators Shane McAnally and Josh Osbourne. The album, he adds, “is a perfect snapshot of who we are and who we were in that moment in Asheville.”\r\n\r\nThey’d taken quite a journey to get there: in the years since they officially arrived on the scene with Meat and Candy, their platinum-certified 2015 major-label debut album, Old Dominion – five musicians who’d previously busted their asses in writing rooms and on dingy stages across the country before breaking big – had racked up countless awards, accolades and undeniable major success. With their rollicking live shows and supreme songcraft they quickly established themselves as one of country music’s most beloved acts.\r\n\r\nOver the course of their career, the band had also been notably named ACM “New Group of the Year,” ACCA “Breakthrough Group of the Year,” AIMP “Songwriter Artist of the Year” and Music Row “Breakthrough Artist of the Year” and in 2017, front man Matthew Ramsey was ASCAP’s “Artist of the Year.” The band has also received nominations for CMT Awards, American Music Awards, Billboard Awards, and iHeart Radio Awards.\r\n\r\nBut at the core of who Old Dominion truly are is collaborators. Musicians. Songwriters. Friends. And that meant being together and being creative was nothing if not essential to their well-being Asheville, then, was the perfect solution.\r\n\r\n“We’d just wake up in the morning, write the song, and then go upstairs and record it that evening,” Ramsey continues before adding, “It got to the point where we were like two weeks in and going, “I can’t believe we’re still coming up with stuff! How are we doing this?””\r\n\r\nIn the end, Old Dominion left Asheville with an entire new album. What they also walked away with was a much-needed creative shot in the arm — a reawakening of sorts after the tumultuous and — as multiple band members admit — mentally challenging struggle through the first six months of the pandemic. Having spent more than a decade together – in the studio, on the road, just living life by each other’s side – last year Old Dominion were forced to separate from one another for nearly all of 2020.  “It was such a confusing time for us,” Ramsey admit of a stretch between March and September 2020 where the band gathered only virtually. “Whereas at first we just thought it was a little break, then it got longer. And then it started getting harder to even write songs. It was such a difficult time to figure out what the hell we were supposed to be doing.” What ultimately saved them, Ramsey believes, was inking a date on the calendar for them to regroup at Asheville’s Echo Mountain studio and begin hammering out what became Time, Tequila and Therapy.\r\n\r\n“It was so exciting to all get back in the same place and be creative again,” says Rosen, and the songs — catchy, poignant, meaningful ones; the sort of tunes this Grammy-nominated band has always thrived on— started popping up near immediately. “The excitement and the happiness just to be back revealed itself in the creative process.”\r\n\r\n“We didn’t set too many expectations. We figured if we did this thing and we ended up with four or five good songs that would be a success,” Rosen continues. “And then the first day we wrote a song like that” — snaps fingers — “and the next day we wrote another song. We got so much done in such a short span that then there was no pressure at all. It just became fun.”\r\n\r\nThe songs were spilling forth in waves, much as they always have –inspired bursts from every one of the band members. “And even if you’re not the guy leading the charge with the idea that day,” Ramsey explains, “you at least know and trust your bandmates and your co-writers that it’s gonna be good. Something is going to happen.”\r\n\r\nNever before has the reigning CMA and ACM “Group of the Year” been so free to follow their creative intuition. On rollicking songs like the tequila-fueled lead single “I Was On A Boat That Day” or the funky “Blue Jeans,” you can palpably feel the exhilaration bursting forth from the band. As Rosen explains, this idea of a complete creative license has been embedded in the band’s DNA from Day One.\r\n\r\n“We’ve always chased what we like,” Rosen says. “So we’ve always felt free to do that. So when it worked at the beginning and it’s continued to work you just trust that it’s gonna work. That’s always been our motto: if we like it somebody else will.”\r\n\r\n“And as our career grew, our audience came to expect us to take left turns here and there,” Ramsey adds. “So we definitely have paved the way for this type of thing. We don’t feel like we are boxed in. We can chase whatever the song is asking for.”\r\n\r\nFor tunes then like the floating “Hawaii” or the heartfelt yet whimsical “All I Know About Girls,” it meant following their muse – even if in the former’s case it was merely a Hawaiian-themed dinner that served as inspiration. One song, however, that the band agrees is particularly meaningful is “The Lonely Side of Town,” not only because it’s a heartfelt treatise on love and loss and learning to accept your place in the world, but also because they recruited the legendary singer Gladys Knight to join them on it.\r\n\r\nYes, as it turned out, Knight lived in Asheville and was even friends with the owner of Echo Mountain. “[The owner] called Gladys, who didn’t even hear the song and Gladys immediately said, “Yah. I love those guys!”” Ramsey recalls with a smile. “It all happened so naturally.”\r\n\r\nNow, as Old Dominion look to the months ahead, they’re nothing if not grateful to once again be taking their cherished songs on the road. Because returning to the stage and, by extension, to one another after such a long time away, Ramsey admits, was and continues to be an emotional experience.\r\n\r\n“Once we went out on the stage that first time back, I think we all knew it was going to be special and we all knew it was going to be emotional,” the singer says, “but there’s no amount of thinking about it that really prepares you for the things that you forgot. “\r\n\r\nNamely, how much Old Dominion still loves what they do.\r\n\r\n“Anytime something gets taken away from you it makes you appreciate it that much more,” Rosen says. “When we got back together the appreciation for it all was just right there.” <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Old+Dominion\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

His songwriting partnership with John Lennon remains the most successful in history. After the group disbanded in 1970, he pursued a solo career and formed the band Wings with his first wife, Linda, and Denny Laine.\r\n\r\nA self-taught musician, McCartney is proficient on bass, guitar, keyboards, and drums. He is known for his melodic approach to bass-playing (mainly playing with a plectrum), his versatile and wide tenor vocal range (spanning over four octaves), and his eclecticism (exploring styles ranging from pre-rock and roll pop to classical and electronica). McCartney began his career as a member of the Quarrymen in 1957, which evolved into the Beatles in 1960. Starting with the 1967 album Sgt. Pepper\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band, he gradually became the Beatles\' de facto leader, providing the creative impetus for most of their music and film projects. His Beatles songs \"And I Love Her\" (1964), \"Yesterday\" (1965), \"Eleanor Rigby\" (1966) and \"Blackbird\" (1968) rank among the most covered songs in history.\r\n\r\nIn 1970, McCartney debuted as a solo artist with the album McCartney. Throughout the 1970s, he led Wings, one of the most successful bands of the decade, with more than a dozen international top 10 singles and albums. McCartney resumed his solo career in 1980. Since 1989, he has toured consistently as a solo artist. In 1993, he formed the music duo the Fireman with Youth of Killing Joke. Beyond music, he has taken part in projects to promote international charities related to such subjects as animal rights, seal hunting, land mines, vegetarianism, poverty, and music education.\r\n\r\nMcCartney is one of the most successful composers and performers of all time. He has written or co-written 32 songs that have reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, and as of 2009, had sales of 25.5 million RIAA-certified units in the United States. His honours include two inductions into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (as a member of the Beatles in 1988 and as a solo artist in 1999), 18 Grammy Awards, an appointment as a Member of the Order of the British Empire in 1965, and a knighthood in 1997 for services to music. As of 2020, he is also one of the wealthiest musicians in the world, with an estimated fortune of £800 million.\r\n\r\nBest known for primarily using a plectrum or pick, McCartney occasionally plays fingerstyle. He was strongly influenced by Motown artists, in particular James Jamerson, whom McCartney called a hero for his melodic style. He was also influenced by Brian Wilson, as he commented: \"because he went to very unusual places\". Another favourite bassist of his is Stanley Clarke. McCartney\'s skill as a bass player has been acknowledged by bassists including Sting, Dr. Dre bassist Mike Elizondo, and Colin Moulding of XTC.\r\n\r\nDuring McCartney\'s early years with the Beatles, he primarily used a Höfner 500/1 bass, although from 1965, he favoured his Rickenbacker 4001S for recording. While typically using Vox amplifiers, by 1967, he had also begun using a Fender Bassman for amplification. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, he used a Wal 5-String, which he said made him play more thick-sounding basslines, in contrast to the much lighter Höfner, which inspired him to play more sensitively, something he considers fundamental to his playing style. He changed back to the Höfner around 1990 for that reason. He uses Mesa Boogie bass amplifiers while performing live.\r\n\r\nMcCartney was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988 as a member of the Beatles and again as a solo artist in 1999. In 1979, the Guinness Book of World Records recognised McCartney as the \"most honored composer and performer in music\", with 60 gold discs (43 with the Beatles, 17 with Wings) and, as a member of the Beatles, sales of over 100 million singles and 100 million albums, and as the \"most successful song writer\", he wrote jointly or solo 43 songs which sold one million or more records between 1962 and 1978. In 2009, Guinness World Records again recognised McCartney as the \"most successful songwriter\" having written or co-written 188 charted records in the United Kingdom, of which 91 reached the top 10 and 33 made it to number one.\r\n\r\nMcCartney has written, or co-written, 32 number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100: twenty with the Beatles; seven solo or with Wings; one as a co-writer of \"A World Without Love\", a number-one single for Peter and Gordon; one as a co-writer on Elton John\'s cover of \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\"; one as a co-writer on Stars on 45\'s \"Medley\"; one as a co-writer with Michael Jackson on \"Say Say Say\"; and one as writer on \"Ebony and Ivory\" performed with Stevie Wonder. As of 2009, he has 15.5 million RIAA certified units in the United States as a solo artist plus another 10 million with Wings.\r\n\r\nCredited with more number ones in the UK than any other artist, McCartney has participated in twenty-four chart topping singles: seventeen with the Beatles, one solo, and one each with Wings, Stevie Wonder, Ferry Aid, Band Aid, Band Aid 20 and \"The Christians et al.\" He is the only artist to reach the UK number one as a soloist (\"Pipes of Peace\"), duo (\"Ebony and Ivory\" with Wonder), trio (\"Mull of Kintyre\", Wings), quartet (\"She Loves You\", the Beatles), quintet (\"Get Back\", the Beatles with Billy Preston) and as part of a musical ensemble for charity (Ferry Aid).\r\n\r\n\"Yesterday\" is one of the most covered songs in history with more than 2,200 recorded versions, and according to the BBC, \"the track is the only one by a UK writer to have been aired more than seven million times on American TV and radio and is third in the all-time list ... [and] is the most played song by a British writer [last] century in the US\". His 1968 Beatles composition \"Hey Jude\" achieved the highest sales in the UK that year and topped the US charts for nine weeks, which is longer than any other Beatles single. It was also the longest single released by the band and, at seven minutes eleven seconds, was at that time the longest number one. \"Hey Jude\" is the best-selling Beatles single, achieving sales of over five million copies soon after its release.\r\n\r\nIn July 2005, McCartney\'s performance of \"Sgt. Pepper\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band\" with U2 at Live 8 became the fastest-released single in history. Available within forty-five minutes of its recording, hours later it had achieved number one on the UK Official Download Chart.\r\n\r\nIn December 2020, the release of his album McCartney III and its subsequent charting at number 2 on the US Billboard 200 earned McCartney the feat of being the first artist to have a new album in the top two chart positions in each of the last six decades. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Paul+McCartney\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It is currently Rice\'s lowest peaking single to date, only behind How She Rolls which peaked at #55 in 2013, which never received real label backing. After the disappointing chart performance of the song, Rice issued a letter to his fans regarding the single, stating \"If you have listened to my music for years and want to hear more depth and meaning, I very much appreciate you, too, and your desires will also be fulfilled on this album (and truthfully, that was my goal on previous albums with songs like \"Carolina Can\" and \"Every Song I Sing.\")\" He went on to mention he was influenced by Garth Brooks and Kenny Chesney.

DENM’s songs are notably genuine and reflective, not just autobiographically, but of the multicultural influences that surrounded him; revealing, if not celebrating, the seedier side of SoCal.   \r\n\r\n“Expect more out of me.

Remixes of some of its tracks were released on 1999\'s American Made Music To Strip By, followed up by the studio release The Sinister Urge in 2001.  \r\n\r\nIn 2003 he made his directorial debut with the release of the film \'House of 1000 Corpses\' to a lukewarm reception, though it garnered quite a cult-following. Its sequel, \'The Devil\'s Rejects,\' was released in 2005. It was received much better than the first film, even getting the \'thumbs up\' from well-known film critic Roger Ebert. Also in his films is his wife Sheri Moon Zombie.\r\n\r\nIn March 2006, he released his newest album, entitled \"Educated Horses\". The album was a more stripped down, raw rock record, and quite a departure from the techno-industrial feel of the old Zombie albums. While this change, along with Zombie\'s change of appearance (he lost the dreadlocks and went back to his natural hair color, blonde), upset many of his fans, it allowed Rob to experiment with his style without deviating from his core fan base.\r\n\r\nThe new album also featured two new band members.

They had two distinct periods of exceptional success: as a pop act in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and as a foremost act of the disco music era in the late 1970s.\r\n\r\nThe Gibb brothers were born on the Isle of Man, UK to English parents in 1946 (Barry Alan Crompton Gibb, September 1) and 1949 ( twins Robin Hugh Gibb and Maurice (pronounced \"Morris\") Ernest Gibb, December 22). The family returned to father Hugh Gibb\'s home town of Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Manchester, England in the early 1950s where the boys began to sing in harmony, debuting in public on one memorable occasion at a local cinema. The boys were going to lip sync to a record, which other children had done at the cinema in previous weeks. However, on the way to the cinema, the record was dropped and broken. As a result, the brothers got on stage and sang themselves. They got a very good response from the crowd, which convinced them that singing was what they wanted to do with their lives.\r\n\r\nIn 1958, the Gibb family, including infant brother Andy (born March 5, 1958 in Manchester), emigrated to Redcliffe, Queensland, Australia, and and went to Humpybong State School. The still very young brothers began performing where they could to raise pocket change. First called the Rattlesnakes, later Wee Johnny Hayes & the Bluecats, and even Les Tosseurs, they were introduced to radio DJ Bill Gates (not to be confused with the founder of Microsoft) by racetrack promoter Bill Goode (who saw them perform at Brisbane\'s Speedway Circus). Gates renamed them after his and Goode\'s initials – thus the name was not simply a reference to the brothers Gibb.\r\nBy 1960, the Bee Gees were featured on television shows, and in the next few years began working regularly at resorts on the Queensland coast. Barry drew the attention of Australian star Col Joye for his songwriting, and Joye helped the boys get a record deal with Festival Records in 1963 under the name \"Bee Gees.\" The three released two or three singles a year, while Barry supplied additional songs to other Australian artists.\r\nA minor hit in 1965, \"Wine and Women,\" led to the group\'s first LP Barry Gibb and the Bee Gees Sing and Play 14 Barry Gibb Songs. By late 1966, the family decided to return to England, and seek their musical fortunes there. Whilst at sea in January, 1967, they heard that \"Spicks and Specks\", a song they had recorded in 1966, had gone to #1 in Australia.\r\n\r\n1960s in England\r\nThe act\'s arrival in England in January 1967 was not immediately propitious, as they were advised \"Groups are out.\" However, the Bee Gees were signed soon after their arrival by Robert Stigwood, and added Australian musicians Vince Melouney (guitar) and former child actor Colin Petersen (drums). Their first single recorded in England was \"New York Mining Disaster 1941\" (1967), a surreal, haunting and macabre composition that made the Top 20 on both sides of the Atlantic. Robert Stigwood boldly claimed that the Bee Gees were \"the most significant new musical talent of 1967\". Their album Bee Gees\' 1st scored well with critics and the public, offering an innovative blend of rock and orchestral ballads such as the charting \"To Love Somebody\" and the well-regarded \"I Can\'t See Nobody.\"\r\nThe next big single was \"Massachusetts,\" which launched the trio into stardom, followed shortly by the followup \"Words\". 1968 saw the release of two albums, \"Horizontal\" and \"Idea.\" The latter contained two more hits, \"I\'ve Gotta Get a Message to You\" and \"I Started a Joke.\" To some critics and fans, these tracks represent the band\'s golden years, well before any of their ubiquitous disco hits.\r\nThe Bee Gees\' next release was Odessa (1969), a dense and complex prog rock album with orchestral accompaniment. By this time, Barry and Robin were increasingly at odds about the creative direction of the group. Once Robert Stigwood made clear that he preferred to promote Barry as the act\'s leader, Robin left. Barry and Maurice released an LP as a duo, Cucumber Castle (the soundtrack to a television special), which contained the #2 UK hit \"Don\'t Forget to Remember.\" Meanwhile, Robin released a solo album, Robin\'s Reign, which included his #2 UK hit \"Saved by the Bell.\"\r\n\r\nEarly 1970s\r\nThe three brothers reunited in the later part of 1970, their feelings about the split evident in many songs about heartache and loneliness. Although they had lost traction on the British charts, the Bee Gees hit #3 in America with \"Lonely Days\" (from the reunion LP 2 Years On) and had their first U.S. #1 with \"How Can You Mend a Broken Heart?\" (from Trafalgar). In 1972, they hit #16 with \"Run to Me\" from the LP To Whom It May Concern; the single also returned them to the British top ten for the first time in three years.\r\nBy 1973, however, the Bee Gees were in a rut. The album, Life in a Tin Can, and its lead-off single, \"Saw a New Morning,\" sold poorly with the single peaking at #94. This was followed by an unreleased album (known as A Kick in the Head Is Worth Eight in the Pants).\r\nOn the advice of Ahmet Ertegun of their U.S. label Atlantic Records, Stigwood arranged for the group to record with famed soul music producer Arif Mardin. The resulting LP, Mr. Natural, included few ballads and foreshadowed the R&B direction of the rest of their career. But when it too failed to attract much interest, Mardin encouraged them to work with the soul music style.\r\nThe brothers attempted to assemble a live stage band that could replicate their studio sound. Lead guitarist Alan Kendall had come on board in 1971, but didn\'t have much to do until Mr Natural. For that album, they added drummer Dennis Bryon, and they later added ex-Strawbs keyboard player Blue Weaver, completing the late 1970s \"Bee Gees band\". Maurice, who\'d previously performed on piano, guitar, organ, mellotron, and bass guitar, as well as exotica like mandolin and Moog, now confined himself to bass.\r\nAt Eric Clapton\'s suggestion, the brothers relocated to Miami, Florida early in 1975 to record. After starting off with ballads, they eventually heeded the urging of Mardin and Stigwood and crafted more rhythmic songs like \"Jive Talkin\'\" and \"Nights on Broadway.\" The latter featured Barry Gibb\'s first attempts at singing falsetto, in the backing vocals toward the end. The band liked the resulting new sound, and this time the public agreed, sending the LP Main Course (album) up the charts. Barry Gibb\'s falsetto would become a staple of subsequent recordings. Mardin was unable to work with the group afterwards, but the Bee Gees enlisted Albhy Galuten and Karl Richardson who\'d worked with Mardin during the Main Course sessions. This production team would carry the Bee Gees through the rest of the 1970s.\r\nThe next album, Children of the World, was drenched in Barry\'s new-found falsetto and Blue\'s synthesizer dance licks. Led off by the single \"You Should Be Dancing,\" it pushed the Bee Gees to a level of stardom they had not previously achieved in the USA, though the new disco sound was not as popular with some diehard fans from the 1960s. The stereotype of disco was canned, fabricated music, but the Bee Gees\' band was closer to a rock act, with rhythm guitar and real drums behind the falsetto.\r\n\r\nLate 1970s: Saturday Night Fever\r\n \"Saturday Night Fever\", became the number one best-selling soundtrack of all time, selling over 40 million of copies. \r\nFollowing a successful live album, Here at Last...The Bee Gees...Live, The Bee Gees agreed to participate in the creation of the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack. It was the turning point of their career. The cultural impact of both the film and the soundtrack was tremendous not only in the United States but in the world, bringing the nascent disco scene into the mainstream.\r\nThree Bee Gees singles (\"How Deep Is Your Love\", \"Stayin\' Alive\", and \"Night Fever\") reached #1 in the United States and in most countries around the world, launching the most popular period of the disco era. They also penned the song \"If I Can\'t Have You\" which became a #1 hit for Yvonne Elliman. Such was the popularity of Saturday Night Fever that two different versions of the song \"More Than a Woman\" received airplay, one by The Bee Gees, which was the B-side of \"Stayin\' Alive,\" and another by Tavares, which was the hit. The Gibb\' sound was inescapable. During an eight-month period beginning in the Christmas season of 1977, the brothers wrote six songs that held the #1 position on the U.S. charts for 25 of 32 consecutive weeks-- three under their own name, two for brother Andy Gibb, and the Yvonne Elliman single.\r\nFueled by the movie\'s success, the album broke multiple records, becoming the highest-selling album in recording history to that point. Saturday Night Fever has since sold circa 40 million copies worldwide [1], making it the best selling soundtrack album of all time.\r\nDuring this era, Barry and Robin wrote \"Emotion\" for Samantha Sang, who made it a Top Ten hit (the Bee Gees sang back-up vocals). A year later, Barry wrote the title song to the movie version of the Broadway musical Grease for Frankie Valli to perform, which went to #1. At one time, five songs written by the brothers Gibb were in the U.S. top ten at the same time. It was the first time this kind of chart dominance had been seen ever.\r\nThe three Bee Gees also co-starred with Peter Frampton in the movie Sgt. Pepper\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band loosely inspired by the classic Beatles album released in 1967. The film had been heavily promoted prior to release, and was expected to enjoy great commercial success. However, the disjointed film was savaged by the movie critics, and ignored by the public, while the accompanying soundtrack was the biggest flop of that year, with hundreds of thousands of records being returned by retailers for credit.\r\n\r\nDuring this period, the Bee Gees\' younger brother Andy followed his older siblings into a music career, and enjoyed considerable success. Produced by Barry, Andy Gibb\'s first three singles all topped the U.S. charts.\r\nThe Bee Gees\' follow-up to Saturday Night Fever was the Spirits Having Flown album. It yielded three more #1 hits: \"Too Much Heaven\", \"Tragedy\", and \"Love You Inside Out.\" This gave the act six consecutive #1 singles in America within a year and a half (a record only surpassed by Whitney Houston). \"Too Much Heaven\" ended up as the Bee Gees\' musical contribution to the Music for UNICEF Concert at the United Nations General Assembly in January 1979, a benefit organized by the Bee Gees, Robert Stigwood, and David Frostfor UNICEF that was broadcast worldwide. The brothers donated the royalties from the song to the charity.\r\nThe Bee Gees\' overwhelming success rose and sank with the disco bubble. By the end of 1979, disco was rapidly declining in popularity, and the backlash against disco put the Bee Gees\' American career in a tailspin. Following their remarkable run from 1975-79, the act would only have one more top ten single in the U.S., and not until 1989. The Bee Gees\' international popularity sustained somewhat less damage.\r\n\r\n1980s and 1990s\r\nIn 1981, The Bee Gees released the album Living Eyes, but with the disco backlash still running strong, the album failed to make the US top 40. In 1983, The Bee Gees had greater success with the soundtrack to Staying Alive, the sequel to Saturday Night Fever. The soundtrack was certified platinum in the US, but didn\'t contain a big hit single from the brothers.\r\nRobin and Barry Gibb released various solo albums in the 1980s, but only with sporadic and moderate chart success. However, the brothers had continuing success behind the scenes, writing and producing for artists such as Barbra Streisand, Dionne Warwick, Diana Ross and Kenny Rogers, including Rogers\' multi-million seller and U.S. #1 hit with Dolly Parton, \"Islands in the Stream\".\r\nThe Bee Gees released the album E.S.P. in 1987, which sold over 3 million copies. The single \"You Win Again\" went to #1 in numerous countries, including Britain, but only reached #75 in the US.\r\n\r\nOn March 10, 1988, the fourth brother, Andy, died at age 30 from myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle due to a recent viral infection. His brothers acknowledge that Andy\'s past drug and alcohol use probably made his heart more susceptible to the ailment. The Bee Gees\' following album, One (1989), featured a song dedicated to Andy, \"Wish You Were Here.\" The album also contained their first U.S. top ten hit (#7) in a decade, \"One.\" After the album\'s release, they embarked on their first world tour in ten years.\r\nFollowing their next album, High Civilization, which contained the UK top five hit \"Secret Love,\" The Bee Gees went on a European tour. After the tour, Barry Gibb began to battle a serious back problem, which required surgery. In the early 1990s, Barry Gibb was not the only Bee Gee living in serious pain. Maurice had a serious drinking problem, which he had battled for many years, but finally conquered with the help of Alcoholics Anonymous.\r\nIn 1993, they released the album Size Isn\'t Everything, which contained the UK top five hit \"For Whom the Bell Tolls.\" Four years later, they released the album Still Waters, which sold over four million copies, and debuted at #11 in the US. The album\'s first single, \"Alone,\" gave them another UK Top 5 hit and a top 30 hit in the US.\r\nIn late 1997, The Bee Gees performed a live concert in Las Vegas called One Night Only. The CD of the performance sold over 5 million copies. This led to a world tour of \"One Night Only\" concerts. The tour included playing to 56,000 people at London\'s Wembley Stadium on September 5, 1998, and concluded in the newly-built Olympic Stadium in Sydney, Australia. The Bee Gees closed the decade with what turned out to be their last full-sized concert, known as \"BG2K,\" on December 31, 1999.\r\n\r\nLater years\r\nIn 2001, they released what turned out to be their final album of new material as a group, This Is Where I Came In. The album gave each member a chance to write in their own way, as well as composing songs together. For example, Maurice\'s compositions and leads are the \"Man in the Middle\" and \"Walking on Air,\" while Robin contributed \"Déjà Vu,\" \"Promise the Earth,\" and \"Embrace,\" and Barry contributed \"Loose Talk Costs Lives,\" \"Technicolour Dreams\", and \"Voice in the Wilderness\". The other songs are collaborative in writing and vocals. The Bee Gees\' last public live show together was Live by Request, a special shown on A&E.\r\nMaurice, who had been the musical director of the Bee Gees during their final years as a group, died suddenly on January 12, 2003 from complications of a twisted intestine. Initially, his surviving brothers announced that they intended to carry on the name \"Bee Gees\" in his memory. But as time passed they decided to retire the group name, leaving it to represent the three brothers together. The same week Maurice died, Robin\'s solo album Magnet was released.\r\nAlthough there was talk of a memorial concert featuring both brothers and invited guests, nothing materialized. Since then Barry and Robin have continued to work independently and have both released recordings with other artists. In late 2004, Robin embarked on a solo tour of Germany, Russia and Asia.\r\n\r\nCurrent news\r\nDuring January 2005, Barry, Robin and several legendary rock artists recorded \"Grief Never Grows Old,\" the official Tsunami relief record for the Disasters Emergency Committee. Later that year, Barry reunited with Barbra Streisand for her top-selling album Guilty Pleasures, released as Guilty Too in the UK as a sequel album to the previous Guilty. Robin continued touring in Europe.\r\nIn February 2006 Barry and Robin reunited on stage for a Miami charity concert to benefit the Diabetes Research Institute. It was their first public performance since the death of brother Maurice. Barry and Robin played at the 30th annual Prince\'s Trust Concert in the UK on May 20, 2006. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bee+Gees\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Embracing the idea that some of the most profound moments of worship emerge not from mountain-top experiences but from difficult, perhaps even catastrophic circumstance gives Ryan’s lyrics a poetic vulnerability reflecting honestly on the difficulties everyone faces. \r\n\r\nAt the age of 18, his youth pastor surprised him by placing a guitar in his hands, stating, \"I felt like the Lord was telling me to buy this for you\" Ryan matured his musical gifts by playing at youth groups, summer camps and mission trips. While attending Northwest Christian College in Eugene, Oregon, Ryan formed an acoustic duo with fellow Christian artist Paul Wright and played in local coffee houses. After adding a full band to the mix, they played throughout the northwest, packing venues and opening for renowned Christian artists. When Wright pursued his solo career, Ryan worked with him as a co-writer, singer, and guitarist on each of Wrights mainstream releases. \r\n\r\nRyan’s own music reflects the wealth of experience garnered from his time with these endeavors. In 2003, Stevenson moved to Boise, Idaho. He continued writing songs, leading worship, and performing in small venues, all while working as a front line paramedic. Wanting to honestly and vulnerably communicate through his recording and his live performance the grace and love that guides him through his own trials, Ryan Stevenson writes with a musical maturity beyond his years and a spiritual sensitivity that easily draws people into the musical message.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Ryan+Stevenson\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Caleb – a talented lyricist and vocalist – and Drew – a songwriter, producer and master mixer - created the perfect musical partnership with Friday Pilots Club. They gained a loyal Chicago following before gaining the attention of Big Machine’s Scott Borchetta and John Varvatos in 2018.\r\n\r\nWhen Caleb and Drew sat down for their first writing session two years ago, their new single “Glory” was born. A deeply personal track, it was co-produced by Drew alongside Multi-Platinum selling producer John Fields (Switchfoot, American Hi-Fi, All Time Low) and Nothing But Thieves guitarist Dom Craik. A gospel tinged, Rock anthem, “Glory” was inspired from two different perspectives and allows for fans to create their own interpretation. Based on fear of one’s own mortality and the fight for change in the current political climate, “Glory” is available digitally now and is currently being introduced to radio.\r\n\r\nFriday Pilots Club recorded “Glory” and additional tracks at Field’s studio in Minneapolis. The environment inspired their creativity and allowed the band to explore diverse sonic possibilities while honing and developing their new sound. Finding influence from bands like Nothing But Thieves, Bring Me The Horizon, Royal Blood, Highly Suspect, along with a dose of The Strokes, Friday Pilots Club found comfort in heavier and darker music.

By sixth grade he had formed his own band. And now he has a single on radio.    So what’s next? According to Jimmie,  “ Whatever  you can dream, you can make reality.”\r\n\r\nBorn and raised in Delaware, Jimmie’s “dream” began early on as a boy in his church choir.  He immediately fell in love with music and couldn’t get enough.  He taught himself to play the guitar, drums, and piano while continuing to develop his chops as a singer.  During his years of high school, Jimmie became extremely active in the musical theater program starring in presentations of “Footloose,” “Grease,” and “Peter Pan” and receiving rave reviews.   This small taste of success was just enough to push the aspiring entertainer to a new level of excellence.\r\n\r\nAfter high school and dedicated to his musical endeavors more than ever, Jimmie put together a demo showcasing his talents as a singer and songwriter   He began taking trips to New York City, banging on doors, and passing around his music.  To help offset some of these costs, he would enter talent contests with cash prizes and usually win.  One such contest led him to the stage of the BET show, “106 and Park”  and got the attention of a Nashville based producer.\r\n\r\nJimmie made his way to Tennessee and work began immediately. Within two days of his arrival, Jimmie and producer Kevin Wayne had written and recorded a song that solidified Jimmie’s sound and musical direction.  Within a few months, major labels, managers, and agents were showing interest in the new artist,   and then came a comet heading for the world.\r\n\r\n“Comet,” Jimmie Allen’s first radio single impacting October ’09, is an exhilarating blend of Jimmie’s diverse musical influences from rock to pop to gospel and r n b.  The choruses soar with huge distorted guitars while the verses pull you close to experience every intimate expression of Jimmie’s performance announcing his immense infatuation with a beautiful girl.  As the drums pound, the bass pulses, and your head bounces.   Handling A&R duties for the project is legendary EMIl executive Kim Stevens responsible for bands like Matchbox 20, Collective Soul, and Saving Abel.  Mark Endert, mixing engineering for Madonna, Maroon 5, and The Fray, mixed the single for radio.  It seems the stars are lining up for Mr. Allen.

They released their first album, The Strength/the Sound/the Songs, in 2005 and the follow up, Rock the Rebel/Metal the Devil, was released in Denmark on February 19, 2007, and in the rest of Europe on February 26, 2007. In March 2007, it topped the Danish album chart as the best selling album, the first metal album ever to do so.\r\n\r\nVolbeat was formed in 2001 after frontman Michael Poulsen split up his former band, Dominus. Volbeat plays a fusion of heavy metal and rockabilly. They are inspired by the rock n\' roll legends Elvis Presley and Johnny Cash. No other Danish heavy rock band Volbeat has been able to get to position 18 at the Danish Top 100 for CD sales in over 10 years. This milestone was reached after their concert at the Roskilde Festival 2006.\r\n\r\nCritics have generally been positive towards The Strength / The Sound / The Songs. The German hard rock magazine RockHard gave it 10/10 in a review.\r\n\r\nVolbeat is also praised for its live performances. Their concert at Roskilde Festival 2006 received a 6/6 stars review in the Danish newspaper BT.\r\n\r\nIn week 8 of 2007, the record Rock The Rebel / Metal The Devil debuted as #1 in the Danish Top 40 for CD-sales and at the same time The Strength / The Sound / The Songs re-entered the chart at #21. Recently, the album achieved gold status for sales in Denmark.\r\n\r\nVolbeat opened the Roskilde Festival in 2007. Volbeat also supported Metallica together with Mnemic at their concert on Denmark July 13 of that year.\r\n\r\nMore recently, Volbeat was announced to do a seven-date European spring tour and to support legendary speed metal act Megadeth in Finland and in their home town, Copenhagen. They have also already announced a few festival appearances for the summer 2008.\r\n\r\nVolbeat has a large range of influences, which can be clearly heard in their music. On their official MySpace site Volbeat lists their influences in their own recognizable way:\r\n\r\n\"Everything from Elvis Presley to Napalm Death .. hail: Johnny Cash, Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis, Chuck Berry, Fats Domino, Ramones, Social Distortion, Motörhead, Black Sabbath, Dio, Megadeth, Metallica, Manic Street Preachers, Iron Maiden and bla bla bla bla...\"\r\n\r\nVolbeat\'s lyrics usually revolve around love, failed love or the power of a twisted mind. They thereby distance themselves from stereotypical heavy metal lyrics, although many of their most popular songs have very dark or sincere themes and plots.\r\n\r\nTheir first single was the cover version of Dusty Springfield\'s evergreen \"I Only Wanna Be With You\". The song doesn\'t differ much from the original with regard to the lyrics, but the accompanying music video is quite typical of Volbeat. In it, the band is seen with a classic microphone on top of a city roof.\r\n\r\nAnother popular feature of the band\'s lyrics are the returning \"series\" of songs. This is best represented with the songs \"Danny & Lucy (11 pm)\" and \"Fire Song\" from The Strength/The Sound/The Songs followed by \"Mr. & Mrs. Ness\" on Rock the Rebel/Metal the Devil. The story is about the two desperate lovers, Danny and Lucy, who are killed in a car crash after Lucy runs away from her family.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Mr. and Mrs. Ness, I\'m so sorry to bring you this - We believe we found your girl in an old burning car way up the hill\"\r\n\r\nIn the successor, \"Mr. & Mrs. Ness\", Lucy\'s mother commits suicide and the father is suspected for the murder:\r\n\r\n\"The old man is crying and he\'s lying - The blood on his hands\' from his wife yeah\"\r\n\r\nThe story is followed further by \"Mary Ann\'s Place\" from Guitar Gangsters & Cadillac Blood, and was concluded with \"You Will Know\" off 2016\'s Seal the Deal & Let\'s Boogie.\r\n\r\nLineup\r\n\r\nMichael Poulsen - Vocals, guitar (ex-Dominus)\r\nRob Caggiano - Guitar (ex-Anthrax)\r\nKaspar Boye Larsen - Bass\r\nJon Larsen - Drums\r\n\r\nFormer members:\r\n\r\nTeddy Vang - Guitar\r\nFranz Gottschalk - Guitar\r\nThomas Bredahl - Guitar\r\nAnders Kjølholm - Bass\r\n\r\n\r\nOfficial homepage : www.volbeat.dk  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Volbeat\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Since 2018, Bryan has been a judge on American Idol.\r\n\r\nBryan is a five-time \"Entertainer of the Year\", being awarded by both the Academy of Country Music Awards and the Country Music Association. In 2019, Bryan\'s 2013 album Crash My Party received the first Album of the Decade award from the Academy of Country Music.\r\n\r\nLuke Bryan was born in Leesburg, Georgia, to LeClaire and Tommy Bryan, who owned a peanut farm. Shortly before Luke was going to move to Nashville at age 19, his elder brother Chris was unexpectedly killed in a car accident. His mother, LeClaire, had made a statement: \"We knew Luke at some point would come to Nashville,\" his mother said. \"But ... you can\'t leave your family, and ... I couldn\'t bear the thought of him being away.\"\r\n\r\nInstead, Luke went to college at Georgia Southern University in Statesboro, Georgia, where he joined the Sigma Chi fraternity, briefly dated his future wife Caroline, and graduated in 1999 with a bachelor\'s degree in business administration. Luke reconnected with Caroline several years later when he was performing at a bar in Statesboro when she was in town, later resuming their relationship and eventually marrying.\r\n\r\nTwo years after graduating from college, Bryan finally made it to Nashville, when his father urged him to pack his truck to pursue a career in music. He initially gained success as a songwriter, but soon after signed as a performer; his first major success was \"All My Friends Say\".\r\n\r\n2006–2009: I\'ll Stay Me\r\nSoon after his arrival in Nashville, Bryan joined a publishing house in the city. Among his first cuts was the title track of Travis Tritt\'s 2004 album My Honky Tonk History.\r\n\r\nHe was later signed by Capitol Nashville to a recording contract. In the meantime, Bryan co-wrote Billy Currington\'s single \"Good Directions\", which went to number one on the Hot Country Songs chart in mid-2007. Bryan co-wrote his debut single, \"All My Friends Say\", with producer Jeff Stevens. This song reached a peak of #5 on the Hot Country Songs chart. In August 2007, Capitol Nashville released Bryan\'s debut album, I\'ll Stay Me. Bryan wrote or co-wrote all but one of its 11 songs. The album\'s second single, \"We Rode in Trucks\", peaked at #33 while \"Country Man\" reached #10.\r\n\r\n2009–2011: Doin\' My Thing\r\nOn March 10, 2009, he released an EP titled Spring Break with All My Friends that featured two new songs, \"Sorority Girls\" and \"Take My Drunk Ass Home,\" plus an acoustic version of \"All My Friends Say\". After this EP, he released his fourth single, \"Do I\" in May 2009. Bryan wrote the song with Charles Kelley and Dave Haywood of Lady A, whose lead singer Hillary Scott also sings backing vocals on it. The song reached #2 on the Hot Country Songs chart.\r\n\r\n\"Do I\" was included on Bryan\'s second album, Doin\' My Thing, which was released in October 2009. Also included on the album was a cover of OneRepublic\'s \"Apologize\". Bryan wrote the album\'s next two singles, \"Rain Is a Good Thing\" and \"Someone Else Calling You Baby\", with Dallas Davidson and Jeff Stevens, respectively. Both of these songs went to #1  on the country music charts. AllMusic gave this album a positive review as well, with Stephen Thomas Erlewine considering Bryan more \"relaxed\" in comparison to his debut. On February 26, 2010, Bryan released a second EP, titled Spring Break 2...Hangover Edition, which featured three new songs: \"Wild Weekend\", \"Cold Beer Drinker\", and \"I\'m Hungover\". While Bryan is mainly known as a country music singer, he has explored other genres like alternative rock with his cover of \"Apologize\".\r\n\r\nBryan appeared on the April 18, 2010, episode of Celebrity Apprentice alongside fellow country star Emily West.

His thoughtful lyrics and booming voice have earned him legions of fans and accolades including 16 No. 1 songs, five Dove Awards, three ASCAP Songwriter of the Year wins and an American Music Award nomination. Before his music career began, his father (a pastor at Harvest Chapel church in Lafayette) taught his son how to play guitar. After completing high school, Camp attended a bible college in Southern California for two years.\r\n\r\nCamp was raised in a Christian home and drew musical inspiration from worship music and secular tunes alike. Touchstone albums in his artistic development include U2\'s The Joshua Tree, Delirious?\' King of Fools , Jars Of Clay\'s debut album, Jars of Clay, and Steven Curtis Chapman\'s The Great Adventure.\r\n\r\nWhen one of the worship leaders at the school heard Camp playing with some friends at his dormitory, he urged him to become involved with their music ministry program, and soon he was performing at Christian music events all over California, recording a self-released disc called Burden Me in 2000.\r\n\r\nAt one such appearance, Camp met a young woman named Melissa, and the two struck up a friendship that blossomed into a romance. When Melissa broke off the relationship after a few months, Camp was crushed, but when he next saw her, her life had taken a serious turn -- she had been diagnosed with ovarian cancer and was in the hospital. When Melissa went into remission, Camp married her, but after their honeymoon, they discovered the cancer had returned, and in early 2001 she passed on; she was only 21. \r\n\r\nCamp poured both his sorrow and the faith that helped see him through into his music, and in 2002 he was signed to BEC Recordings, who released his first nationally distributed album, Stay; it was both a critical and commercial success, and five songs from the disc reached the top of the Christian singles chart. While touring in support of Stay, Camp met singer Adrienne Leisching, former singer with the Benjamin Gate; the two hit it off, and in 2003 they were married, and have since been blessed with two daughters. \r\n\r\nIn 2004, Camp released his second album for BEC, Carried Me: The Worship Project, which matched the gold record success of Stay, and Camp won two Dove Award trophies for Best Male Vocalist and Best New Artist. In 2005, Camp released two albums -- a studio set, Restored, which rose to number 45 on the Billboard Top Albums chart and spawned three number one Christian singles, and a live disc, Live Unplugged from Franklin TN. Camp also recorded the song \"Open Up Your Eyes\" for the soundtrack of the hit film The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, which earned him another Dove Award. The fall of 2006 brought another studio set from Camp, Beyond Measure, which reached number 29 on the Billboard charts and produced two more hit singles. \r\n\r\nSpeaking Louder than Before, his sixth album, was released on November 25, 2008. \r\n\r\nThe Way Songfacts reports that his seventh album, We Cry Out: The Worship Project , was released on August 24, 2010, and peaked at #1 on the Billboard Christian Albums Chart. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Jeremy+Camp\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

She was a four-time Grammy Award winner whose music career included five number-one hits and another ten top-ten hits on the US Billboard Hot 100, and two Billboard 200 number-one albums, If You Love Me, Let Me Know (1974) and Have You Never Been Mellow (1975). Eleven of her singles (including two Platinum) and 14 of her albums (including two Platinum and four 2× Platinum) have been certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). With global sales of more than 100 million records, Newton-John is one of the best-selling music artists from the second half of the 20th century to the present.\r\n\r\nThe youngest child of Professor Brin Newton-John and Irene, daughter of Nobel Prize winning physicist, Max Born, Newton-John moved to Melbourne, Australia, with her family when she was five. By the age of fifteen, she had formed an all-girl group called Sol Four. Later that year she won a talent contest on the popular TV show, “Sing, Sing, Sing,” which earned her a trip to London. By 1963, Newton-John was appearing on local daytime TV shows and weekly pop music programs in Australia. She cut her first single for Decca Records in 1966, a version of Jackie DeShannon’s \"Till You Say You’ll Be Mine.\" In 1971, she recorded a cover of Bob Dylan’s \"If Not For You,\" co-produced by John Farrar, with whom she continued to collaborate. \r\n\r\nHer 1973 U.S. album debut, \"Let Me Be There,\" produced her first top ten single of the same name, with Newton-John being honored by the Academy Of Country Music as Most Promising Female Vocalist and a Grammy Award as Best Country Vocalist. This proved to be only the beginning of a very exciting career. Her countless successes include three more Grammys, numerous Country Music Awards, American Music Awards and Peoples Choice Awards, five 1 hits including “Physical,” which topped the charts for ten consecutive weeks, and 15 top 10 singles. \r\n\r\nIn 1978, her co-starring role with John Travolta in “Grease” catapulted Newton-John into super-stardom. This film led to the production of the most successful movie musical soundtrack in history, featuring the duets \"You’re The One That I Want\" and \"Summer Nights,\" with Travolta, as well as her mega-hit, \"Hopelessly Devoted To You.\" The film was re-released worldwide in 1998 in celebration of its 20th anniversary to even more acclaim, a true testament to the film’s timeless quality. Her other film credits include “Xanadu,” “Two Of A Kind,” “It’s My Party,” and “Sordid Lives.” She followed that success, by co-starring with her daughter, Chloe, in the Showtime movie, “The Wilde Girls.” Clearly following in her mother’s footsteps, Chloe has recently signed her first record label contract. \r\n\r\nNewton-John appeal was boundless. With a career spanning more than three decades she was adored by fans across the world. Throughout her career, the much-loved star, who danced with Gene Kelly in “Xanadu,” hosted the popular internationally syndicated “Wild Life” television show, was bestowed an O.B.E. (Order Of The British Empire) by Queen Elizabeth in 1979, has held many humanitarian causes close to her heart, particularly since the birth of her daughter Chloe in 1986. She served as Goodwill Ambassador to the United Nations Environment Programme and in 1991, the Colette Chuda Environmental Fund/CHEC (Children’s Health Environ-mental Coalition) was founded after the tragic death of Chloe’s best friend from a rare childhood cancer, with Olivia serving as National Spokesperson for ten years. Newton-John’s devotion and shared commitment to CHEC’s mission and goals enabled the organization to receive worldwide attention and support. (For more information visit www.CHECnet.org.) \r\n\r\nHer charmed life has not been without its share of upset. In the 90s, Newton-John successfully overcame her own battle with breast cancer, which inspired her self-penned and produced album, “GAIA,” her most personal album reflecting upon her experiences with cancer. She used these experiences to gain greater self-awareness and became a positive inspiration to millions of people battling cancer. As a breast cancer survivor, Newton-John became increasingly well known and respected for talking openly about her battle with breast cancer and for promoting public awareness of the importance of early detection. Her personal victory against cancer led her to announce her partnership with the Austin & Repatriation Medical Centre and the creation of the “Olivia Newton-John Cancer Centre” (ONJCC) on the Austin Campus in her hometown, Melbourne, Australia. The ONJCC will provide a comprehensive range of services and facilities for cancer treatment, education, training and research. (For more information visit www.armc.org.au.) \r\n\r\nNewton-John was acknowledged many times by charitable and environmental organizations for her ongoing efforts, among them: the American Red Cross, the Environmental Media Association, the Women’s Guild of Cedar’s Sinai Medical Center, the Rainforest Alliance and Concept Cure. Olivia promotes breast health awareness and has introduced the “Olivia Breast Self-Exam Kit,” an aid to help women perform self-exams with more ease and confidence (www.liv.com). \r\n\r\nIn the 2000\'s, her interational recognition continued to grow. She was invited by the Vatican on behalf of Pope John Paul II to perform at the Jubilee Celebration for the Sick and Healthcare Workers. Olivia was thrilled to perform at the Opening Ceremony of the Sydney 2000 Olympics to an estimated global viewing audience of four billion people. Adding to this Olympic experience is what Olivia feels is one of her most memorable moments – the honor of carrying the Olympic Torch during the Olympic Torch Relay. Her passion for Australia was ignited again when Olivia reunited with friend and business partner, Pat Farrar, to promote the Koala Blue brand with distinctly Australian wines to proudly bring “the taste of Australia” to the rest of the world. Her healing spirit also led to the opening of the GAIA Retreat & Spa in her homeland of Australia (www.GaiaRetreat.com.au). \r\n\r\nIn 1999, her album, \"Back With A Heart,\" garnered her an Emmy Award for her songwriting. In 2000/2001, Olivia released her only live album, \"One Woman’s Live Journey,\" followed by “Magic - The Very Best of Olivia Newton-John,” which celebrated thirty years of recording. And if that wasn’t enough, she also released her first holiday album, “The Christmas Collection.” In 2002, a CD of duets simply titled, “2,” was recorded in Australia and features a host of talented Ozzies along with a couple of her American friends, followed by “Indigo: Women of Song,” a tribute to some of her favorite female performers. \r\n\r\nThe CD “Stronger Than Before,” release in 2005, features songs of inspiration, courage and hope that relate to the complex emotions cancer patients and their loved ones experience. A portion of the CD’s proceeds benefit cancer research. \r\n\r\nHer recording, “Grace and Gratitude,” a CD for relaxation to promote spiritual balance and physical and emotional healing, was released in September 2006 and coincided with the launch of Newton-John\'s wellness products for women. \r\n\r\nIn 2002, Newton-John was inducted into the prestigious Australian Music Hall Of Fame at the 16th Annual Aria Awards. Her latest honors include receiving the Lifetime Achievement Award by friend John Travolta at the G’Day L.A. Ball in 2006. \r\n\r\nNewton-John was also appointed as an Officer of the Order of Australia by the Queen for her “service to the entertainment industry as a singer and actor, and to the community through organizations supporting breast cancer treatment, education and training research, and the environment.” \r\n\r\nWesite www.OliviaNewton-John.com <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Olivia+Newton-John\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

With an artist’s eye for detail and an inquisitive spirit eager to learn from every situation, Gokey has soaked up more life experience than most people twice his age.  From the joyful to the heartbreaking, those experiences infuse Gokey’s 19 Recordings/RCA Nashville debut, My Best Days, a collection of songs that resonate with honest emotion and tap into the collective hopes and dreams that define life.\r\n\r\nIn listening to the album, it is obvious Gokey has a strong sense of who he is as an artist and what he wants to say to his audience.  There’s a focus and a sense of purpose rarely found on a debut disc.  “It’s country, but it has a little different edge,” says the Milwaukee native.  “I want to create my own fingerprint, and I want my music to say something.  I want to have an emotional connection, but at the same time, I want to make people just have a good time, make them want to dance, have fun and party.  I wanted to throw all those emotions in that CD, and I feel like I accomplished that.”  \r\n\r\nDuring his tenure on American Idol, Gokey impressed the judges with his versatility as he performed hits by The Temptations, Carrie Underwood, Michael Jackson and Rascal Flatts, among others.  As he continued to rise through the ranks of Idol hopefuls, it became increasingly clear that Gokey was blessed with a voice that could sing any style of music and turn any song into a compelling moment.  So why did he choose a career as a country artist?  “I felt like I could be myself,” he says matter-of-factly, and admits he got some career advice from someone he respected.  “Randy Travis was a mentor for American Idol, and he asked me, ‘Have you thought about country?  You really need to, because people would love you and the amount of soul that you could bring to country.  You bring a uniqueness to it.’”\r\n\r\nGokey is still somewhat surprised and humbled by the encouragement he got from one of his musical idols, and says the overall American Idol experience helped him define who is as an artist.  “As the show progressed, I started to find myself and started to hone in on who I want to be, what I want to be, and what I want to represent,” Gokey relates.  “The thing that I identified with the most was the message.  When I sing, I want to sing something passionately, and I want to sing something that has a lot of meaning to me.  I always found that in country.  I want to be known as a country singer the rest of my life.”\r\n\r\nGokey’s life before American Idol embodies the themes that populate the country music lexicon, from his humble roots in a poor but loving family to his hard-working days as a truck driver to the loss of the person most dear to him: his wife, Sophia.  Life has prepared Danny Gokey to sing country music. \r\n\r\nBorn the fifth of six children, Danny grew up in a family that was often short on cash, but long on love and encouragement.  His parents were music fans and introduced their children to a variety of sounds including Motown, jazz, and country.  “My first CD was Wynonna Judd, and I loved it.  I love her,” Gokey gushes.  “She had this soul that went into it, and you just felt the music when it played, and the first single that I bought in my life was Tim McGraw’s ‘Don’t Take the Girl.’  I listened to that song, and it made me want to cry.  Vince Gill is another one of my favorites.”\r\n\r\nLike many artists before him, from the legendary Aretha Franklin to Platinum-selling rock band Switchfoot, Gokey can trace his musical roots to the church.  While working in the music departments at two different churches, Gokey also logged hard days as a trucker.  “I drove an eighteen wheeler semi-truck, a big rig,” he says.  “I liked it actually. Was it what I wanted to settle with for the rest of my life?  No, because music was where my passion was.”\r\n\r\nHis wife encouraged Danny to give American Idol a shot, but just a month before the audition, Sophia died unexpectedly after what should have been a routine heart surgery.  The couple had been high school sweethearts, and Danny was devastated.  He found solace and healing in music.  “Music was the key place where I would go, and I would let the sorrow come out, let the tears just roll.  Some music I would listen to had a determination in it, and I resolved that this is not going to be the thing that destroys me for the rest of my life.  It can be turned into a building block, and I can become a better person for it.  Music brought healing.  That’s how I got through and still get through it today.”\r\n\r\nKnowing firsthand the power of music, Gokey entered the studio determined to craft a debut album filled with songs that matter.  “I definitely have something to say with this album, and I think people will recognize that,” he says.  “Music was the catalyst that helped bring healing, a determination and a resolve.  That’s why I want to do music.  I want to bring that same hope.  When my wife passed, I tried out for American Idol, and music brought me hope.  It brought me a reason to live again.  Now I want to bring that into my music.”\r\n\r\nWorking with producer Mark Bright, well known for his work with Carrie Underwood and Rascal Flatts, Gokey has crafted an album filled with memorable, meaningful songs, penned by some of the industry’s top songwriters.  Veteran tunesmiths Marv Green and Kent Blazy penned the title track and first single, “My Best Days Are Ahead of Me.”  It’s a buoyant look toward a brighter future, an optimistic anthem sure to be adopted by all who believe in better days ahead. \r\n\r\n“I Still Believe” is a groove-oriented number co-written by American Idol judge Kara DioGuardi.  “It’s Only” is a powerful call to action that illustrates some of life’s challenges and encourages us to make a difference where we can.  Penned by Tom Douglas and Lady Antebellum’s Charles Kelley and Dave Haywood, the song is a compelling ballad that demonstrates the range and emotional depth in Gokey’s soul-drenched voice.\r\n\r\n“I Will Not Say Goodbye,” written by Lari White, Chuck Cannon and Vicky McGehee, is a poignant ballad that Gokey says he just had to record.  “That song just totally represents what I felt when my wife passed away,” says Gokey, who has launched a charitable foundation, Sophia’s Heart, in his wife’s memory.  “Sophia’s Heart got started because I wanted to keep her legacy alive.”\r\n\r\nThough there are songs sure to make listeners stop in their tracks and examine their priorities, there are also several that will inspire fans to roll down the windows and sing along.  “Life on Ya” and “Get Away” are infectious slices of fun, and “Crazy Not To” captures the exhilaration of falling in love.  “You don’t want people to feel overwhelmed with one certain thing,” Gokey says of balancing the meatier songs with more fun fare.  “You want them to experience different things, and I think we accomplished that.  At one point, I said, ‘I want fun, fun songs!’  You want to be very balanced, and I feel like we did a good job at that.  Sometimes I want to have fun just for no reason.”\r\n\r\nPoignant, rowdy, thought-provoking and smile-inducing -- Danny Gokey’s debut album is all those things and so much more.  It’s a reflection of life’s peaks and valleys from a young man well acquainted with both.  “I’m very proud of this CD.  Every song has something to say,” he relates.  “We’re all human, and human beings are made up of so many different aspects.  We want to be entertained, but we also want to be inspired, and music is a universal language.”\r\n\r\n\r\nHes Great singer too if your a fan plz listen to his music  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Danny+Gokey\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Carlos Santana\'s increasing involvement with guru Sri Chinmoy took the band into more esoteric music, though it never lost its Latin influence.\r\n\r\nIn 1998, the band Santana was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with Carlos Santana, José \"Chepito\" Areas, David Brown, Gregg Rolie, Mike Carabello, and Michael Shrieve The band has earned nine Grammy Awards and three Latin Grammy Awards, the latter all in 2000.

Their lineup consists of Fred Durst (lead vocals), Sam Rivers (bass, backing vocals), John Otto (drums, percussion), DJ Lethal (turntables), and Wes Borland (guitars, vocals). Their music is marked by Durst\'s angry vocal delivery and Borland\'s sonic experimentation. Borland\'s elaborate visual appearance, which includes face and body paint, masks and uniforms, also plays a large role in the band\'s live shows. The band has been nominated for three Grammy Awards, have sold 40 million records worldwide and won several other awards.\r\n\r\nFormed in 1994, Limp Bizkit became popular playing in the Jacksonville underground music scene in the late 1990s, and signed with Flip Records, a subsidiary of Interscope, which released their debut album, Three Dollar Bill, Y\'all$ (1997). The band achieved mainstream success with their second and third studio albums, Significant Other (1999) and Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water (2000), although this success was marred by a series of controversies surrounding their performances at Woodstock \'99 and the 2001 Big Day Out festival.\r\n\r\nShortly after the release of Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water, Limp Bizkit went on a hiatus while Fred Durst recovered from being crucified by Slipknot. Borland left the group in 2001, but Durst, Rivers, Otto and Lethal continued to record and tour with guitarist Mike Smith. Following the release of their album, Results May Vary (2003), Borland rejoined the band and recorded The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1) (2005) with Durst, Rivers, Lethal and drummer Sammy Siegler before entering a hiatus. In 2009, the band reunited with Borland playing guitar and began touring, culminating with the recording of the album Gold Cobra (2011), after which they left Interscope and later signed with Cash Money Records. In 2014, a sixth studio album, Stampede of the Disco Elephants, was to be released but remained in development hell. Eventually, a new album called STILL SUCKS was recorded with all of the original band members and released digitally only in October 2021. \r\n\r\nFred Durst grew up in Jacksonville, where he took an interest in breakdancing, hip hop, punk rock and heavy metal. He began to rap, skate, beatbox and deejay. While mowing lawns and working as a tattoo artist, he developed an idea for a band that combined elements of rock and hip hop. Durst played with three other bands, Split 26, Malachi Sage, which were unsuccessful, and 10 Foot Shindig, which Durst left to form a new band. Durst told Sam Rivers, the bassist for Malachi Sage, \"You need to quit this band and start a band with me that\'s like this: rappin\' and rockin\'.\" Rivers suggested that his cousin, John Otto, who was studying jazz drumming at the Douglas Anderson School of the Arts and playing in local avant garde bands, become their drummer. Durst, Rivers and Otto jammed and wrote three songs together, and Wes Borland later joined as a guitarist.\r\n\r\nDurst named the band Limp Bizkit because he wanted a name that would repel listeners. According to Durst, \"The name is there to turn people\'s heads away. A lot of people pick up the disc and go, \'Limp Bizkit. Oh, they must suck.\' Those are the people that we don\'t even want listening to our music.\" Other names that were considered by Durst included Gimp Disco, Split Dickslit, Bitch Piglet, and Blood Fart. Every record label that showed an interest in the band pressured its members to change its name. Limp Bizkit developed a cult following in the underground music scene, particularly at the Milk Bar, an underground punk club in Jacksonville. The band\'s local popularity was such that Sugar Ray, who had a major label contract, opened for a then-unsigned Limp Bizkit at Velocity with hip hop group Funkdoobiest. Milkbar owner, Danny Wimmer, stated that Limp Bizkit \"had the biggest draw for a local band. They went from playing [for] ten people to eight hundred within months. Fred ... was always marketing the band. He would go to record stores and get people involved, he was in touch with high schools.\" However, the band knew that to achieve national success, they would have to distinguish themselves in their live performances. Attracting crowds by word of mouth, the band gave energetic live performances, covering George Michael\'s \"Faith\" and Paula Abdul\'s \"Straight Up\", and featuring Borland in bizarre costumes. Borland\'s theatrical rock style was the primary attraction for many concert attendees. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Limp+Bizkit\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

We were out there, and something came up and our producer had to take some time off. So I took that opportunity to return home to Los Angeles with family and spend a little time at home but I\'ll be headed back up there in a couple of weeks to pick it up again.\" When asked about a potential timeframe for a release date, Kroeger said \"it\'ll be done when it\'s done\", explaining that the band would rather not be confined to a timescale for fear of making \"a shitty record\". \"Release dates are primarily arrived at by business interests, like record labels and whatever. We don\'t have one of those\", he said. \"We\'ve been managing ourselves for about a year. So, the answer is no. We\'re doing it on our schedule, at our own pace, and it\'ll be done when it\'s done. \'Cause we\'ve blown up deadlines in the past lots of times. Because we feel that you can make a good record and be late, but you can\'t, or you shouldn\'t, make a shitty record to be on time.

The band was created by youth pastor Mark Hall who also serves as a lead vocalist. The band previously served and performed in a youth group in Atlanta.\r\n\r\nDiscovered by, among others, contemporary Christian music legend Steven Curtis Chapman, Casting Crowns got a recording contract and vaulted to popularity in 2003 with songs such as If We Are the Body and Who Am I. The Until The Whole World Hears Songfacts reports that Casting Crown\'s 2009 Until The Whole World Hears album  recorded 167,000 sales in its first week, the largest selling debut week sales figures by a Christian artist in Nielsen Soundscan history. \r\n\r\nOver the past eight years, Atlanta based Casting Crowns has consistently delivered music that points believers back to what truly matters. \r\n\r\nSince its launch in 2003 the band has garnered 14 GMA Dove Awards, three GRAMMY Awards and an American Music Award. In addition, the band has seen three RIAA Platinum Albums (Casting Crowns, Lifesong, Altar and The Door), two RIAA Platinum DVDs (Live From Atlanta and Lifesong Live), two RIAA Gold Albums (Until the Whole World Hears, Peace on Earth) and two Gold DVDs (Altar and The Door Live and Until The Whole World Hears Live).

Said TobyMac regarding the album title: \"I want my music to depict what I\'m going through. I want to write about the things that upset me, move me, hurt me and haunt me. The things that are real. With Tonight, I was determined to live more passionately with God. I was laying down the gauntlet. Eye On It is a continuation of that. It\'s saying, \'This is the person I want to be and I\'m going to keep my eye on it, God willing!\'\"\r\nThe ascension of TobyMac’s solo career has been nothing short of spectacular. In an era of declining music sales he has consistently defied the odds and has seen his sales increase with each new album release. This is no small feat. With his fourth studio album TONIGHT released on Feb. 9,  he is poised to take things higher yet again. \r\nHaving climbed the mountain once with the group dcTalk (4 Grammys, more than 8 million albums sold), TobyMac knows how difficult the journey can be and how much work the process actually takes. Rarely does an artist get to soar to great heights for a second time, but soar he has. He took home his first Grammy as a solo artist last year after receiving Grammy nominations for each of his first four solo projects (Momentum, Welcome To Diverse City, Portable Sounds, Tonight). And last year TobyMac topped 2 million in total albums sold during his solo career. TobyMac has also remixed the Welcome to Diverse City album and Momentum, calling the new albums Renovating Diverse City and Re:Mix Momentum, respectively. He has done it with a combination of talent, hard work and humility which has produced songs that resonate with people from all walks of life .  \r\nUpon embarking on his solo career, Toby sought to surround himself with a talented and diverse cast of characters, aptly named the Diverse City Band.  The result has been a musical fusion that radiates with an unquenchable energy and a penetrating message.   \r\nA self-professed perfectionist when making records—he’s been known to relentlessly tweak and massage every little thing in an inexorable effort to make it sound better—Toby is the first to admit that he has to work really hard to make great music. “That’s what drives me,” he says. “I feel like I have to work harder than other people to get there. Sometimes I feel like I’m slightly under-gifted; I usually don\'t sit down and write a great song in just a few minutes like others can. But I think my work ethic makes up for that.” \r\nStarting with dcTalk, and then going solo when the group disbanded in 2000, Toby still clings to such rootsy notions as hard work, persistence, patience and—perhaps most relevant of all—the power of music, which he insists is still what keeps him going. \r\n“It’s the truth,” he says. “I still believe that a song can penetrate a heart. I believe God can use a song to open someone’s mind and heart. Other songs can just drop what I call,  \'the joy bomb\' on somebody. I fight really hard to remain unjaundiced—to keep believing that you can actually walk into a studio and write a song that breathes life. That’s the hardest fight for a guy who’s been doing this for a while; it’s easy to fall into the trap of just making it your job. But I still believe that songs matter.” \r\nThe songs on TONIGHT certainly matter—everything from the prayerful first single “City On Our Knees” to the testimonial “Changed Forever,” from the worshipful “Captured” to the confessional “Start Somewhere,” and even down to the put-on-your-party-hat grooves of “Funky Jesus Music” and “ShowStopper.” One theme that runs loud and clear throughout is the idea that we all need God, and we need him now—this morning, this afternoon, tonight.\r\n “Right here, right now / Under the stars / I promise You my heart / ’Cause it starts tonight,” Toby sings on the chorus of the title track. “If you gotta start somewhere why not here? If you gotta start sometime why not now?” he asks on “City on Our Knees.” And “I wanna straighten this before the sun goes down tonight,” he proclaims on “Start Somewhere.” \r\n“There’s definitely a sense of urgency on this record,” says co-producer Chris Stephens, who has worked on TobyMac’s last three CDs. “And it’s an album that speaks of unity, of coming together and finding common ground to worship God.” \r\nToby has long had a passion for racial reconciliation and unity, a recurrent theme in his music. TONIGHT includes songs of reconciliation of another kind—between husband and wife. Toby and Amanda have been happily married for 15 years, but like all couples, it can be hard work sometimes. For Toby, who best expresses his emotions through music, it was a natural step to write about it. In “Hold On,” he sings, “If you move just a little bit closer / You can put your head on my shoulder . . . / Wipe away those tears / This one’s for you.” And on “Start Somewhere,” he’s downright confessional: “I said some things that I regret / And if I could, I’d take ’em back / But here I am, and there you are / The space between us is not so far / I’m reaching out my hand in love.” \r\n“‘Hold On’ is very personal,” Toby says. “Many lines are there to encourage my wife, but I know those lines could encourage anybody in a relationship. As for ‘Start Somewhere,’ any time you’re in love with somebody, you’re going to bang heads from time to time. I don’t know how many times I’ve been lying in bed, sweating it out and thinking, How am I going to make this right? But then you reach that moment of apology and forgiveness. That’s one of my favorite songs on the record; it’s a personal perspective on confrontation and reconciliation.” \r\nAnd then there’s “Wonderin’,” in which Toby reminisces about the past with Kevin Max and Michael Tait in dcTalk, one of Christian music’s biggest acts in the 1990s. “We was ridin’ in style, clockin’ them miles / With the songs that He put down deep in our hearts . . . / I’m wonderin’ ’bout the way I spend my days / Wonderin’ if it’s even worth the chase / Wonderin’ if they’re stealin’ me from you.” \r\n“It’s just a warm look back at dc Talk,” says Toby, almost wistfully. “It’s reminiscing about Michael and Kevin and what we did together, and recognizing their influence on me. I love what I do today, but there are times when I wonder,What if we stayed together? I’ve got these dreams I’m pursuing now, but are they stealing me from you? I think about Kevin and Michael on every song I write. That\'s the truth man, we climbed a mountain together.” \r\nSonically, TONIGHT is typical TobyMac in many ways—an eclectic mix of rap, rock, pop and funk, all laden with catchy hooks and melodies just itching for airplay and audience singalongs. There’s even a healthy dose of reggae on the album closer “Break Open the Sky,” where Toby flexes his Jamaican family ties while Israel Houghton provides guest vocals. Other visiting vocalists include Skillet’s John Cooper on “Tonight” and Relient K’s Matthew Thiessen on “Wonderin’.” \r\nOf course most of the vocals belong to the artist himself. Stephens says Toby “has stretched himself as a vocalist, he writes about things he is passionate about and his vocals reflect that urgency\'\'. Toby agrees: “I do more singing on this record than ever before. I’m learning to use my vocal instrument in different ways, and I’m getting more comfortable with it everyday\'\'.\r\nIt all adds up to a project that reflects one man’s desire to push himself beyond “very good,” to dig deep in the quest for that other country where greatness resides. He certainly reached for it. Hard. \r\n“I’ve worked very hard not to fall into the trap of making this just a gig,” he says. “If it is a labor, it’s a labor of love. I know music can’t change the world, but who says God can\'t speak through a song.\" \r\nRight here, right now.

The tour made stops in a total of 42 cities across the country.\r\n\r\nSummer 2012 was spent supporting O.A.R on their Amphitheatre tour, headlining four amphitheaters in Florida as well as festival performances at Outside Lands, Hangout, Forecastle, Summer Camp, Summer Set, The Allman Bro’s Peach Festival and two performances at Red Rocks Amphitheatre. After completing a Fall tour of the East and South East, Rebelution will be headlining The Hollywood Palladium on New Years Eve, heading to New Zealand for the Raggamuffins Festival in February and headlining their annual Winter Greens Tour around the USA in Feb - May 2013. \r\n\r\nPeace of Mind marks the first time Rebelution has expanded beyond their usual self-production enlisting producers Michael Goldwasser (Easy Star All-Stars), Amp Live (Zion-I), Yeti Beats (Kool Keith, George Clinton), Keith Armstrong and Errol Brown (Stephen, Ziggy, Damian, and Bob Marley). The album builds upon the band’s signature style while venturing into new musical genres from the lush strings incorporated into the gentle “Route Around” to the driving guitar and synths throughout “Lady In White”.\r\n\r\nRebelution has developed into a front-runner for grassroots, independent and tour driven music groups. Originally formed in 2004, members Eric Rachmany (vocals / guitar), Rory Carey (keyboards), Wesley Finley (drums), and Marley D. Williams (bass) met in college, while residing in Isla Vista, a popular beachside community in Santa Barbara. It was there that the seeds to Rebelution’s future were planted creating inspiring and engaging music that would leave their listeners with the sense that they have the power to make this world a better place. The band continuously tours across the country, ventured to South America and Europe, and has previously performed at Bonnaroo, Lollapalooza and Austin City Limits among others.\r\n \r\nContact:\r\nManagement:  Silverback Artist Management / Raise Up Music\r\nDean Raise – dean@raiseupentertainment.com\r\nJon Phillips – Jon@silverbackmusic.net\r\n \r\nBooking – Paradigm Agency\r\nAaron Pinkus – apinkus@paradigmagency.com\r\n \r\nJamie Simone\r\nPFA Media\r\njsimone@pfamedia.net\r\n212-334-6116 <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Rebelution\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Rector’s stylistic influences include pop, rock, and folk music.\r\n\r\nRector took piano lessons as a small child but did not begin playing music seriously until he picked up the guitar in high school. He began writing songs in tenth grade and formed a band called Euromart the following year. Euromart made an EP and played club shows in Tulsa, but dissolved when the members left for college.\r\n\r\nAfter high school, Rector attended the University of Arkansas where he studied marketing. During his freshman year he recorded a self-titled EP that featured the song “Conversation”, which won the Grand Prize in the pop category of the John Lennon Songwriting Contest in 2006.  He is the youngest person ever to win the award for the pop category. The EP grew popular in surrounding states, and by his sophomore year, Rector began touring frequently on weekends and during breaks in the school year. In 2008 Rector released his first full-length record, Twenty Tomorrow, followed by Songs That Duke Wrote in 2009. In 2009 Rector was given the NAMA award for best singer songwriter in Northwest Arkansas.  During his college career at the University of Arkansas he played approximately 200 shows.\r\n\r\nIn June 2009 Rector moved to Nashville with his wife to pursue songwriting and to continue his career as an artist. On November 28, 2009 he released Jingles and Bells, a Christmas album composed of classic Christmas songs. Rector arranged the songs and played all the instruments on the album. He released his most recent album Into The Morning on February 16, 2010. Through word of mouth, the record peaked at #5 on the iTunes pop chart, #10 on the iTunes overall chart, and #11 on Billboard Heatseekers.[3] Immediately following the release, Rector co-headlined the “Three Amigos” tour throughout the eastern half of the United States with fellow Nashvillians Steve Moakler and Andrew Ripp. Later in the spring of 2010 he toured with both Dave Barnes and Five for Fighting.\r\n\r\nHis song “After All” was used in the June 15, 2010 episode of the ABC Family show Pretty Little Liars.\r\n\r\nAlbums\r\nYear 	Title\r\n2007 	Twenty Tomorrow\r\n2008 	Songs That Duke Wrote\r\n2010 	Into the Morning\r\n2011      Something like This\r\n\r\nEPs\r\nYear 	Title\r\n2006 	Ben Rector\r\n2009 	Jingles and Bells\r\n\r\nSingles\r\nYear 	Title\r\n2010 	Summer Candy <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Ben+Rector\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

He also played the lead guitar; the other band members were Gary Burkham on bass who left in 2000 and was replaced by Chris Lewis, Anthony Walker on drums, and Ben Heffley on guitar. They were influenced by Metallica and Pantera. An album, The Massacre Begins was released in 2002. Songs they recorded included \"Hell Razor\" and \"Kill Me Again\". The band however broke up after a trip to Los Angeles, and Jinks took a year off from music. In around 2005, he started playing country music, the music he grew up with.\r\n\r\nJinks is backed by The Tone Deaf Hippies. He began to release albums in the country genre in 2008.

The album debuted at #4 on the Top Country Albums chart, selling 11,300 copies in the first week. Jinks supported I\'m Not the Devil with a co-headlining tour with Whitey Morgan and the 78\'s in August, September, and October.

Growing up in Louisville, Kentucky, Ian was influenced by genre-blending artists like The Red Hot Chili Peppers and Kid Cudi,  and began writing lyrics at the age of 15. Encouraged by friends and family, he released a series of mixtapes and an EP which made the iTunes Top 25 pop charts.\r\n\r\nWith success came a strong sense of discouragement regarding the future of his career. Ian chose to take a break from music to attend Indiana University. He graduated in 2016, triple majoring in business. He took his shot at the American Dream by accepting a job offer in Anheuser-Busch\'s’ Global Management Program. Within eight months, he was offered a promotion and raise that would entail 60+ hour work weeks. He turned down the offer to pursue his music career instead.\r\n\r\n“Working in corporate America was a struggle for me,” Ian noted. “I found myself waking up every day feeling like a prisoner. I started writing music again as an outlet to express my frustrations.”\r\n\r\n That fall he released his debut single “My Friends Are Robots”, an ode to the lack of creativity and self-expression he experienced while working in corporate America. He followed up with the hard-hitting, alt-anthem “A Painting in Paris”, paying tribute to the vanity of his generation. He captured a feeling and emotion he feels his generation is experiencing — uncertainty surrounding how we present ourselves in a digital world. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Arrested+Youth\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

An early diet of bands like the Arctic Monkeys, the Strokes, and Gorillaz fueled their imagination as they learned their instruments and began writing songs together during high school in the late 2000s. By the time they began releasing music in 2012, Inner Wave had transformed themselves into a pysch-driven indie pop band with a lo-fi bent and a strong D.I.Y. presence.

He is known for his powerful style and wide vocal range. After Led Zeppelin\'s breakup following the sudden death of drummer John Bonham in 1980, Plant pursued a successful solo career. Popular tracks from this period include \"Big Log\", \"Tall Cool One\", \"In the Mood\", and \"I Believe\". Throughout his career, he\'s been influenced by many styles such as blues, folk, 50s rock and roll, dance pop, and more.\r\n\r\nIn 1984, Plant formed a short-lived all-star retro rock group with musicians Jimmy Page (also of Led Zeppelin), Jeff Beck, and Phil Collins called The Honeydrippers. The band had a Top Ten hit with their song \"Sea of Love\", a remake of the Phil Phillips\' chestnut. Plant\'s also notably performed with Page in the outfit Page & Plant.\r\n\r\nPlant\'s love of the music of Morocco led him to a new collaboration called Robert Plant and the Strange Sensation.  The band\'s releases met with critical acclaim and numerous Grammy nominations. They completed a notable 2006 tour of Europe in September.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Plant began recording and performing with American bluegrass star Alison Krauss.

Active for six decades, they are one of the most popular and enduring bands of the rock era. In the early 1960s, the Rolling Stones pioneered the gritty, rhythmically driven sound that came to define hard rock. Their first stable line-up consisted of vocalist Mick Jagger, multi-instrumentalist Brian Jones, guitarist Keith Richards, bassist Bill Wyman, and drummer Charlie Watts. During their formative years, Jones was the primary leader: he assembled the band, named it, got them gigs, and drove their sound and image. After Andrew Loog Oldham became the group\'s manager in 1963, he encouraged them to write their own songs. Jagger and Richards became the primary creative force behind the band, alienating Jones, who had developed a drug addiction that interfered with his ability to contribute meaningfully.\r\n\r\nRooted in blues and early rock and roll, the Rolling Stones started out playing covers and were at the forefront of the British Invasion in 1964, becoming identified with the youthful and rebellious counterculture of the 1960s. They then found greater success with their own material, as \"(I Can\'t Get No) Satisfaction\" (1965), \"Get Off of My Cloud\" (1965), and \"Paint It Black\" (1966) became international number-one hits. Aftermath (1966) – their first entirely original album – is considered by The Daily Telegraph to be the most important of their formative records. In 1967, they had the double-sided hit \"Ruby Tuesday\"/\"Let\'s Spend the Night Together\" and experimented with psychedelic rock on Their Satanic Majesties Request. They returned to their rhythm and blues roots with hit songs such as \"Jumpin\' Jack Flash\" (1968) and \"Honky Tonk Women\" (1969), and albums such as Beggars Banquet (1968), featuring \"Sympathy for the Devil\", and Let It Bleed (1969), featuring \"You Can\'t Always Get What You Want\" and \"Gimme Shelter\". Let It Bleed was the first of five consecutive number-one albums in the UK.\r\n\r\nJones left the band shortly before his death in 1969, having been replaced by guitarist Mick Taylor. That year they were first introduced on stage as \"The Greatest Rock and Roll Band in the World\". Sticky Fingers (1971), which yielded \"Brown Sugar\" and included the first usage of their tongue and lips logo, was their first of eight consecutive number-one studio albums in the US. Exile on Main St. (1972), featuring \"Tumbling Dice\", and Goats Head Soup (1973), yielding the hit ballad \"Angie\", were also best sellers. Taylor was replaced by Ron Wood in 1974. The band continued to release successful albums, including their two largest sellers: Some Girls (1978), featuring \"Miss You\", and Tattoo You (1981), featuring \"Start Me Up\". Steel Wheels (1989) was widely considered a comeback album and was followed by Voodoo Lounge (1994), a worldwide number-one album. Both releases were promoted by large stadium and arena tours, as the Stones continued to be a huge concert attraction; by 2007 they had recorded the all-time highest-grossing concert tour three times, and as recently as 2021 they were the highest-earning live act of the year. From Wyman\'s departure in 1993 to Watts\' death in 2021, the band continued as a four-piece core, with Darryl Jones playing bass on tour and on most studio recordings, while Steve Jordan became their touring drummer following Watts\' death. Their 2016 album, Blue & Lonesome, became their twelfth UK number-one album.\r\n\r\nThe Rolling Stones\' estimated record sales of 200 million make them one of the best-selling music artists of all time. The band has won three Grammy Awards and a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2004.

Variance Magazine called the single \"Rollercoaster\" a \"brilliant summer anthem.\" Bleachers went on their debut Come Alive! tour, which features Night Terrors of 1927 and Joywave as opening acts, from March to April 2015. From there, they went on the Strange Desire World Tour from July to November of that same year. They juggled this with the Charli and Jack Do America Tour, a tour co-headlined by Bleachers and Charli XCX.\r\n\r\nBleachers\' second album Gone Now was released June 2, 2017. Its lead single \"Don\'t Take the Money\" has been described by Atwood Magazine as \"an epic uplifting pop-rock anthem ultimately about how when love is real, its worth everything that comes along with it\". In celebration of the album release, he brought his childhood bedroom on tour with him. He had it dismantled and rebuilt inside of a portable trailer. During May and June concerts, fans could enter the \"moving, living art exhibit\" and listen to the album prior to its official release. Antonoff explained in a press release, saying \"when I thought about where this album was coming from and what it’s kissing goodbye I thought of this room. I wished I could play the album for people who care about Bleachers in this space that it is coming from and leaving.\" The band was on its Gone Now Era: Part 1 tour from September to November 2017. The tour featured Tove Stryke, Bishop Briggs, and Tangerine as openers. \r\n\r\nIn September 2017, Bleachers performed on MTV Unplugged at The Stone Pony in Asbury Park, New Jersey. The live session was later released as an album, also entitled MTV Unplugged. The album features 11 tracks from both Gone Now and Strange Desire and was released November 10, 2017. Antonoff produced the soundtrack of Love, Simon, released on March 16, 2018. He contributed five songs, with four being credited to Bleachers—\"Alfie\'s Song (Not So Typical Love Song)\", \"Rollercoaster\", \"Keeping a Secret\", and \"Wild Heart\"— and one credited to his real name, a duet with MØ titled \"Never Fall in Love\". Throughout 2019, Bleachers released the third volume of Terrible Thrills in a series of four vinyl records, each featuring covers of songs from Gone Now by female artists as well as new demos by Bleachers.\r\n\r\nIn late 2019, Antonoff began recording the third Bleachers album. During this time the band embarked on a three-day \"mini-tour\" called the \"I Love Making This Album but I\'m Also Losing My Mind in Here & Need to Come Out and Play\" Tour. On January 6, 2020, Antonoff announced on Twitter that a new Bleachers album would come within the year. In May, Bleachers was featured on Carly Rae Jepsen\'s song \"Comeback\" which was the first official release of the band in nearly two years. On the Bleachers Twitter account, a song called \"Take the Sadness Out of Saturday Night\" has been teased for months, and starting on November 14, 2020, a phone tree was set up for fans to call to hear clips from the song. \r\n\r\nOn November 16, 2020, Bleachers released the first two singles from Take the Sadness Out of Saturday Night, \"45\" and \"Chinatown\", the latter featuring Bruce Springsteen.

He rose to prominence during the 1970s as the lead vocalist of the heavy metal band Black Sabbath, during which period he adopted the nickname \"Prince of Darkness\". Born and raised in Birmingham, Osbourne became a founding member of Black Sabbath in 1967, and sang on every album from their debut in 1970 to Never Say Die! in 1978. The band was highly influential on the development of heavy metal music, in particular their critically acclaimed releases Paranoid, Master of Reality and Sabbath Bloody Sabbath. Osbourne was fired from Black Sabbath in 1979 due to alcohol and drug problems, but went on to have a successful solo career, releasing 13 studio albums, the first seven of which received multi-platinum certifications in the US. Osbourne has since reunited with Black Sabbath on several occasions. He rejoined in 1997 and helped record the group\'s final studio album, 13 (2013), before they embarked on a farewell tour that ended with a February 2017 performance in their hometown, Birmingham. His longevity and success have earned him the informal title \"Godfather of Metal\".\r\n\r\nOsbourne\'s total album sales from his years in Black Sabbath, combined with his solo work, are over 100 million. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Black Sabbath and into the UK Music Hall of Fame as a solo artist and as a member of the band. He has been honoured with stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and Birmingham Walk of Stars. At the 2014 MTV Europe Music Awards, he received the Global Icon Award. In 2015, Osbourne received the Ivor Novello Award for Lifetime Achievement from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors.\r\n\r\nIn the early 2000s, Osbourne became a reality television star, appearing as himself in the MTV reality show The Osbournes alongside wife and manager Sharon and two of their three children, Kelly and Jack. He co-stars with Jack and Kelly in the television series Ozzy & Jack\'s World Detour.

The group is currently composed of rhythm guitarist, singer/songwriter Andy Hull, lead guitarist Robert McDowell, keyboardist and percussionist Chris Freeman, bassist Jonathan Corley and drummer Tim Very. Former drummer Jeremiah Edmond parted ways with the band in January 2010 to focus on his family as well as running the band\'s record label, Favorite Gentlemen. \r\n\r\nManchester Orchestra has released several extended plays and six studio albums: I\'m Like A Virgin Losing A Child (2006), Mean Everything to Nothing (2009), Simple Math (2011), Cope (2014) (as well as its accompanying acoustic version, Hope), A Black Mile To The Surface (2017), and  The Million Masks of God (2021). They are signed to independent record label Favorite Gentlemen Recordings, which is distributed through Sony Music Entertainment, and Loma Vista Recordings. \r\n\r\nManchester Orchestra originated in the suburbs of Atlanta, Georgia. They are named after the English city Manchester, a place rich in musical history (The Smiths, The Stone Roses, Joy Division, Oasis, New Order, Happy Mondays). Feeling increasingly alienated at his \"small-town-Georgia, Christian high school\", Hull became so frustrated that he spent his senior year studying at home. Early in their career, the band recorded an album entitled Nobody Sings Anymore. However, it was never released due to the shift in the band\'s musical direction and personal changes undergone following its recording. The band stated that \"the band that made the record was different to the band now.\" Some of the tracks written for the album were released instead on the EP You Brainstorm, I Brainstorm, but Brilliance Needs a Good Editor.\r\n\r\nFollowing  You Brainstorm, I Brainstorm, but Brilliance Needs a Good Editor, Manchester Orchestra recorded and released their debut album I\'m Like a Virgin Losing a Child. This album gained the attention of the music industry, and eventually led to their signing with Canvasback. The album was released nationwide July 27, 2007. Guitarist Robert McDowell did not appear on this album. The song Wolves At Night was featured in the video game NHL 08.\r\n\r\nIn October of 2008 the band recorded their second EP, Let My Pride Be What\'s Left Behind, with producer Dan Hannon and engineer Brad Fisher. It was released October 7, 2008.\r\n\r\nIn early September 2008, the band announced on their Myspace blog that they had begun recording their second album entitled Mean Everything to Nothing with producer Joe Chicarrelli (The Shins, My Morning Jacket). On February 4, 2009, the band posted a link to a free download of the single I\'ve Got Friends and performed an acoustic version at The Fly’s In The Courtyard Sessions. The album was released April 21, 2009.\r\n\r\nOn January 26, 2010, the band released a digital split EP with Kevin Devine entitled I Could Be The Only One. Following the release of the Manchester Orchestra/Kevin Devine split EP, it was announced that Kevin Devine would record a full-length album along with the members of Manchester Orchestra later that year, with half the album written by Devine and half by Andy Hull. On April 10, 2010, it was announced the new project\'s name was Bad Books, and that the album would be released under that moniker, and not \"Manchester Orchestra + Kevin Devine\" as previously speculated. The self-titled full-length Bad Books album was digitally released on October 19, 2010, and on CD on November 9, 2010.\r\n\r\nOn March 2010, in an interview with the Dallas Observer, Hull mentioned that the band had begun work on a follow up to 2009\'s Mean Everything to Nothing tentatively entitled Let Go of Your Sorrowful Groaning. He also said that the band have around 34 songs they are demoing and that in writing this album he was imagining a \"spiritual miscarriage\". Later that year in an interview with Rip It Up magazine, the band announced that they were in the middle of recording their third full-length album. Although without a title, they explained that the album was completely different to anything they had released in the past. The album was being recorded with Dan Hannon and balanced between Blackbird Studios (Nashville, TN) and their own Favorite Gentlemen Studios (Atlanta, GA).\r\n\r\nOn October 23, 2010, during an appearance at Radio 104.5 in Philadelphia, following a Bad Books show in support of their recently released self-titled debut album, Manchester Orchestra debuted an acoustic version of the title track of their new album, Simple Math.

The band have released 41 albums, including 17 studio albums, 13 live albums, four EPs and seven compilations. They have also released 47 singles and 20 video albums. Two electronic games have been released with Iron Maiden soundtracks, and the band\'s music is featured in a number of other video games.\r\n\r\nAs pioneers of the new wave of British heavy metal movement, Iron Maiden achieved initial success during the early 1980s. After several lineup changes, the band went on to release a series of UK and US Platinum and Gold albums, including 1980\'s eponymous debut album, 1981\'s Killers, 1982\'s The Number of the Beast, 1983\'s Piece of Mind, 1984\'s Powerslave, 1985\'s live release Live After Death, 1986\'s Somewhere in Time, 1988\'s Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, 1990\'s No Prayer for the Dying and 1992\'s Fear of the Dark.

They were formed in 1998.\r\n\r\nWhen NEEDTOBREATHE’s Bear and Bo Rinehart set out to write the songs that appear on the band’s new album, The Reckoning, they felt something bigger awaited them. It wasn’t just commercial success either. The band’s last album The Outsiders hit No. 9 on Billboard’s Rock Albums chart, went Top 20 on the Top 200, saw the band sell out venues such as Nashville’s Ryman Auditorium and Chicago’s House of Blues, and score an impressive number of placements in blockbuster films and numerous prime time television-shows. \r\n\r\nWith their reputation as a must-see live act built from non-stop touring, the Rinehart brothers, pastor’s sons who hail from the rural South Carolina town of Possum Kingdom, along with drummer Joe Stillwell and bass player Seth Bolt, were determined to create a statement-making album that truly captured the magic behind this genuinely appealing rock band.\r\n\r\nLyrically, all roads lead from the album’s title, which Bear says has several different meanings, one of them being the justification of accounts. “I like the idea that you put in all this work and at some point it comes to a peak -- that’s the reckoning time.”\r\n\r\nWhat the band emerged with is a timeless-sounding album rooted in classic American rock and roll, unafraid to veer off into unexpected directions. Songs such as “Maybe They’re On To Us” address the paranoia of wondering whether people know too much about the band. “It also asks, ‘Are we still driven in the same way?’ We’re always questioning ourselves,” Bear says. Even the songs that may sound light-hearted on the surface, like “White Fences,” “Slumber,” and “Drive All Night,” explore serious themes. “’White Fences’ is about the American dream of growing up in a big house with a white picket fence, but when the dream is broken and things don’t pan out the way you planned, asking who’s going to fix it,” Bo says. “’Slumber’ is meant to be about how beauty is all around you but you just can’t see it because of the funk you’re in,” Bear says. “It speaks to something that we really care about which is giving yourself a chance.” And there’s “Drive All Night,” a galloping barnstormer that Bear sees as a statement on the false idea that one can run away from one’s problems. \r\n\r\nWith their intriguing melodies and bright choruses, the songs on The Reckoning are certain to translate in the live setting, something that is crucial to the band. “The worst thing that could happen is you get done playing and people don’t think about you again. We’ll do whatever it takes to force people to make a decision about our band, whether they love us or not. It makes for more passionate fans.” <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/NEEDTOBREATHE\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Inspired by the rock and reggae sounds of Bob Marley, Sublime, 311 and The Beastie Boys, the band’s music evolved into their distinct Dirty Heads style. \r\n\r\nTo complete the Dirty Heads’ sound, the duo added percussionist Jon Olazabal, drummer Matt Ochoa and David Foral on bass. With a set of solid material, the Dirty Heads were further motivated to take their craft to the next level, and they began building a loyal fan base throughout the west coast, while performing acoustically at local bars and small music venues. \r\n\r\nExecutive produced by the Grammy Award-winning Rob Cavallo (Green Day, Kid Rock, Paramore), the band connected with sought-after producers Steve Fox and Stan Frazier (Sugar Ray) working long hours to polish their material and further develop their style. The Dirty Heads also recruited mixing engineer Mario Caldato Jr., best known for his work with the Beastie Boys, to add the finishing touches and create just the right blend.\r\n\r\nThe band’s highly-anticipated expanded album titled, Any Port in a Storm – Special Edition (Executive Music Group (EMG)/Fontana, a division of Universal Music Group Distribution) features 22 tracks and a bonus video that are reminiscent of the upbeat, sun-soaked Southern California party energy. The first smash hit single is “Lay Me Down” featuring Rome, of Sublime with Rome.  \r\n\r\nAny Port in a Storm also features one of the final recordings of the late music industry icon Billy Preston. Frequently referred to as “The Fifth Beatle,” Preston played on three tracks, including “Stand Tall,” “Chelsea,” and “Driftin.’ ” Additional special guests on the album are drummer Josh Freese (A Perfect Circle, Sting, The Vandals), and veteran session percussionist Alex Acuna, whose A-list musician resume includes Peter Gabriel, Johnny Clegg, and Jackson Browne, to name only a few. \r\n\r\nRecently, the band’s music has been attracting attention throughout the world of entertainment.

They formed in 1994 with the members of Sam Loeffler, Pete Loeffler (brothers) and Matt Scott. Matt was later replaced in 1996 by Joe Loeffler as bass player.

Geno Lenardo (Filter) filled in until August 2005, when Dean Bernardini (brother-in-law to the Loefflers) became the new bass player of Chevelle. \r\n\r\n 	Inspired by the lurching riffs of Helmet and the soft/loud vocal styling of Tool, Chicago-based trio Chevelle\'s aggressive, heavy sound is all about mounting tension exploding into raw guitar bursts.  They started out playing parties and outdoor events, which quickly led to bookings at Chicago clubs when youngest member Joe was just 16. \r\n\r\n\r\nChevelle released their first studio album titled  Point #1, on May 4, 1999.\r\nChevelle recorded a demo known as The Blue Album, and played small concerts for the next three years until they were signed on to Steve Taylor\'s Squint Entertainment.[4] The band recorded for 17 days in Electrical Audio studios, and in 1999, Chevelle released the album, Point #1 which was produced by Steve Albini.\r\n\r\n\r\nChevelle released their second studio album titled  Wonder What\'s Next, on October 8, 2002.\r\nReleased three years after Point #1 and following tours with bands like Filter, Sevendust, Powerman 5000, and Machine Head — the band had inked a deal with Epic and issued Wonder What\'s Next, released in August 2002.

Chevelle is currently back in the studio working on the new album. According to Pete Loeffler\'s Twitter account, the band has completed six songs as of April 2011. Chevelle drummer Sam Loeffler mentioned the album could feature a duet with a female artist, and also mentioned that the album could either be fully acoustic or a return to the hard rock style Chevelle had on Wonder What\'s Next, however Sam Loeffler had mentioned it would be \"definitely returning to heavy melodic rock, which is the sound we love.\"[citation needed] As of May 2011, Chevelle is finished writing songs for the new album and is in Pasadena, CA at JHOC Studios to work with Joe Barresi as the album\'s producer.[citation needed].

In 1994 Ozzy decided to come out of retirement, and the numerous recording sessions for Ozzmosis took place. Around this time, Zakk was also offered the open guitar slot in Guns N\' Roses and had a hard time deciding whether to tour with Ozzy or join Guns N\' Roses. Neither project panned out. This gave Wylde the opportunity to record his own acoustic solo album, \"Book of Shadows.\" After limited commercial success with Book Of Shadows, in 1998, Zakk and drummer Phil Ondich formed Black Label Society and recorded their debut album \"Sonic Brew.\" Nick Catanese had been Zakk\'s touring rhythm guitarist since the Book Of Shadows tour (Zakk records all guitars on his albums). Craig Nunenmacher has been drumming for the band since 1919 Eternal (2001) following Phil\'s departure.

Her debut album Life as a Dog was released in 2014, peaking on Billboard\'s Heatseekers Albums chart at No. 2 and Billboard\'s Rap Albums chart at No. 14. In 2016, she signed with Interscope Records as the first artist signed to Dan Reynolds\' Night Street Records imprint. She was nominated for two awards at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards: Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical (for Every Where Is Some Where), and Best Rock Song (for \"Blood in the Cut\").\r\n\r\n.Flay was born Kristine Meredith Flaherty in Wilmette, Illinois, on June 30, 1985. She attended nearby New Trier High School. When she was seven, her parents divorced and her mother remarried soon after, bringing in a stepbrother and a stepsister. When she was 14 years old, her biological father—a guitarist who loved all musical genres—died of undisclosed causes related to his alcoholism; many of her songs include references to him. Flaherty\'s stepfather helped raise her and later adopted her. She has described herself as a tomboy during childhood, preferring baggier clothing and rejecting \"all things girly\". In 2003, she enrolled at Stanford University, pursuing a double major in psychology and sociology. According to Flaherty, many people she met during her time at Stanford influenced her musical style.\r\n\r\nK.Flay began her music career in 2003, believing that most hip-hop hits on the radio were \"simplistic, misogynistic and formulaic\". After bragging to a friend that she could write similar songs, she wrote \"Blingity Blang Blang\", which she described as a \"low-budget rap parody that contained far too many obscenities\". After writing and performing the song, Flaherty realized that she enjoyed writing and recording music. She continued to experiment with music by writing songs and performing and recording them on her computer. She released a mixtape called Suburban Rap Queen in 2005, which she produced on her laptop, and began performing.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, K.Flay released her self-titled EP, and in 2011 self-released the mixtape I Stopped Caring in \'96, which she later remarked was a career turning point.

It was known for featuring popular Christian bands and its motorcross stunts.\r\n\r\nSteve Taylor has produced many of their hit albums, and several of the songs he has worked on with the band (such as Breakfast, Take Me To Your Leader) feature Taylor\'s humor and quaint lyrics.\r\n\r\nDuring the Step Up To The Microphone tour, the band featured the drums on a rotating platform that could tilt downward up to 90 degrees. In fact, there were two sets of drums and Peter Furler (the original drummer) and Duncan Phillips would wear seat belts, so they wouldn\'t fall out, and have a rotating drum-off. This feature is still used on their tours and has grown to be quite popular.\r\n\r\nIn 2003, Jody Davis left the band to care for his sick daughter, Bethany.

He also holds United States citizenship. He first achieved fame in the 1970s emerging from the London punk rock scene as the lead singer of the group Generation X. Subsequently, he embarked on a solo career which led to international recognition and made Idol a lead artist during the MTV-driven \"Second British Invasion\" in the US. The name \"Billy Idol\" was inspired by a schoolteacher\'s description of him as \"idle\".\r\n\r\nIdol began his music career in late 1976 as a guitarist in the punk rock band Chelsea. However, he soon left the group. With his former bandmate Tony James, Idol formed Generation X. With Idol as lead singer, the band achieved success in the United Kingdom and released three studio albums on Chrysalis Records, then disbanded. In 1981, Idol moved to New York City to pursue his solo career in collaboration with guitarist Steve Stevens. His debut studio album, Billy Idol (1982), was a commercial success. With music videos for singles \"Dancing with Myself\" and \"White Wedding\" Idol soon became a staple of then newly-established MTV.\r\n\r\nIdol\'s second studio album, Rebel Yell (1983), was a major commercial success, featuring hit singles \"Rebel Yell\" and \"Eyes Without a Face\". The album was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipment of two million copies in the US. In 1986, he released Whiplash Smile. Having accumulated three UK top 10 singles (\"Rebel Yell\", \"White Wedding\" and \"Mony Mony\"), Idol released a 1988 greatest hits album titled Idol Songs: 11 of the Best; the album went platinum in the United Kingdom. Idol then released Charmed Life (1990) and the concept album Cyberpunk (1993).\r\n\r\nIdol spent the second half of the 1990s focusing on his personal life out of the public eye.

Their classic line-up consisted of lead singer Roger Daltrey, guitarist and singer Pete Townshend, bass guitarist John Entwistle, and drummer Keith Moon. They are considered one of the most influential rock bands of the 20th century, selling over 100 million records worldwide and holding a reputation for their live shows and studio work.\r\n\r\nThe Who developed from an earlier group, the Detours, and established themselves as part of the pop art and mod movements, featuring auto-destructive art by destroying guitars and drums on stage. Their first single as the Who, \"I Can\'t Explain\", reached the UK top ten, followed by a string of singles including \"My Generation\", \"Substitute\" and \"Happy Jack\". In 1967, they performed at the Monterey Pop Festival and released the US top ten single \"I Can See for Miles\", while touring extensively. The group\'s fourth album, 1969\'s rock opera Tommy, included the single \"Pinball Wizard\" and was a critical and commercial success. Live appearances at Woodstock and the Isle of Wight Festival, along with the live album Live at Leeds, cemented their reputation as a respected rock act. With their success came increased pressure on lead songwriter Townshend, and the follow-up to Tommy, Lifehouse, was abandoned. Songs from the project made up 1971\'s Who\'s Next, which included the hit \"Won\'t Get Fooled Again\". The group released the album Quadrophenia in 1973 as a celebration of their mod roots, and oversaw the film adaptation of Tommy in 1975. They continued to tour to large audiences before semi-retiring from live performances at the end of 1976. The release of Who Are You in 1978 was overshadowed by the death of Moon shortly after.\r\n\r\nKenney Jones replaced Moon and the group resumed activity, releasing a film adaptation of Quadrophenia and the retrospective documentary The Kids Are Alright. After Townshend became weary of touring, the group split in 1982. The Who occasionally re-formed for live appearances such as Live Aid in 1985, a 25th anniversary tour in 1989 and a tour of Quadrophenia in 1996–1997. They resumed regular touring in 1999, with drummer Zak Starkey. After Entwistle\'s death in 2002, plans for a new album were delayed. Townshend and Daltrey continued as the Who, releasing Endless Wire in 2006, and continued to play live regularly.\r\n\r\nThe Who\'s major contributions to rock music include the development of the Marshall stack, large PA systems, use of the synthesizer, Entwistle and Moon\'s lead playing styles, Townshend\'s feedback and power chord guitar technique, and the development of the rock opera. They are cited as an influence by hard rock, punk rock and mod bands, and their songs still receive regular exposure. \r\n\r\nThe Who is one of the most influential rock bands of the 20th century. Their appearances at Monterey and Woodstock helped give them a reputation as one of the greatest live rock acts and they have been credited with originating the \"rock opera\". The band has sold over 100 million records worldwide.\r\n\r\nThe group\'s contributions to rock include the power chord, windmill strum and the use of non-musical instrument noise such as feedback. The band influenced fashion from their earliest days with their embrace of pop art and the use of the Union Jack for clothing. The guitar-smashing incident at the Railway Hotel in 1964 is one of Rolling Stone magazine\'s \"50 Moments That Changed the History of Rock \'n\' Roll\".\r\n\r\nPink Floyd began to use feedback from their early shows in 1966, inspired by the Who, whom they considered a formative influence. Shortly after arriving in London in 1966, Jimi Hendrix visited Marshall\'s music shop demanding an amp setup like Townshend\'s and manipulated electronic noises in ways that Townshend had pioneered. The Beatles were fans and socialised with Moon in particular during the mid-1960s. In 1965, Paul McCartney said the Who \"are the most exciting thing around\" and was inspired to write \"Helter Skelter\" in the group\'s \"heavy\" style; John Lennon borrowed the acoustic guitar style in \"Pinball Wizard\" for \"Polythene Pam\".\r\n\r\nThe loud volume of the band\'s live show influenced the approach of hard rock and heavy metal. Proto punk and punk rock bands such as the MC5, the Stooges, the Ramones, the Sex Pistols, the Clash and Green Day cite the Who as an influence. The Who inspired mod revival bands, particularly the Jam, which helped other groups influenced by the Who become popular. The Who influenced hard rock bands such as Guns N\' Roses. In the mid-1990s, Britpop bands such as Blur and Oasis were influenced by the Who. The Who have also influenced pop punk band Panic! at the Disco.\r\n\r\nThe Who has inspired many tribute bands; Daltrey has endorsed the Whodlums, who raise money for the Teenage Cancer Trust. Many bands have covered Who songs; Elton John\'s version of \"Pinball Wizard\" reached No. 7 in the UK. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Who\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The band changed their name to the Goo Goo Dolls (the name was picked out from an ad in a True Detective magazine) at the request of a local club owner who refused to let them play otherwise. They were originally signed on by Metal Blade Records, and they released their self-titled debut album in 1987.\r\n\r\nIn their early career, they were often dismissed by critics as \" The Replacements wannabes.\" While they were embraced by college radio and the local punk scene (Playing such venues as CBGB\'s), especially after the release of their third album, Hold Me Up (1990), it was not until 1995, with the release of their single \"Name,\" (from the album A Boy Named Goo) that the Goo Goo Dolls experienced any commercial success. Their mainstream success, however, was bittersweet as they faced a lengthy legal battle with Metal Blade Records over royalties that were being withheld from the band; hence, the Goos eventually switched to Metal Blade\'s parent company, Warner Brothers. In 1998, \"Iris\" was released on the City of Angels soundtrack, and the Goos were propelled to stardom, as the song stayed on the Billboard charts at number one for 18 weeks and was nominated for three Grammys that year. The song was also included on their fifth album, \"Dizzy Up the Girl,\" which was released that same year.\r\n\r\nAs of February 2007, The Goo Goo Dolls broke the record of having the most top 10 songs on the AC Charts, with 12 top 10 hits!

Inside (Deluxe) was released the following year and includes a sequel track of their viral hit \"Hayloft\", entitled \"Hayloft II\".\r\n\r\nThe band began in Vancouver in January 2005, when guitarist and vocalist Ryan Guldemond was at music school and wanted to start a band based around vocal-driven pop songs. He recruited his sister Molly along with a friend from college, Debra-Jean Creelman, to accompany his own vocals for the songs he had written, and the trio played as an acoustic act before adding drummer Kenton Loewen and bassist Jeremy Page.\r\n\r\nThe five members started off playing under the name Mother, and in the fall of 2005, they independently released a self-titled album. This debut album was recorded with Howard Redekopp, who had also worked with The New Pornographers and Tegan and Sara. When the Vancouver Province rated Mother as one of the top five BC bands to watch for in 2007, they began to receive acclaim for their debut album. Shortly thereafter, Mother landed a nationally broadcasted concert opening for K\'naan and The Wailin\' Jennys. In the summer of 2006, they opened for the Australian band, The Cat Empire, at the sold-out Vancouver International Jazz Festival. Later that year, they made their debut in central Canada at the Montreal International Jazz Festival on June 29 as well as in Toronto on July 1, Canada Day, at the Harbourfront Centre.\r\n\r\nIn October 2006, after playing a set at the Pop Montreal festival, Mother met with Last Gang Records and later signed a four-album contract. At that point the label encouraged the band to change their name to avoid legal issues, so rather than changing it completely they decided to simply rename themselves Mother Mother. On February 20, 2007, the band re-released its debut album under the new name, renaming the album Touch Up and including two new songs, as well as artwork and overdubs different from the original.\r\n\r\nThe band released their second album, O My Heart, in 2008. In December 3, it was announced that Debra-Jean Creelman had left Mother Mother, with the addition of a new singer/keyboardist, Jasmin Parkin, announced in January 2009.\r\n\r\nMother Mother\'s third album, Eureka, was released on March 15, 2011. The album\'s lead single, \"The Stand,\" entered the Canada Singles Top 100 chart in May 2011 and peaked during that week at position 76. The album prompted a reviewer at the Toronto Star to describe the band as \"evolving into orchestral harmonies and hip hop-influenced power ballads, as if Adam Lambert had joined The Dirty Projectors.\" On January 9, 2012, Kraft Foods launched a series of television commercials featuring the song \"Bright Idea.\"\r\n\r\nMother Mother\'s fourth album, The Sticks, was released on September 18, 2012.

His songs have been covered by a wide variety of artists such as Bonnie Raitt, Ronnie Milsap, Willie Nelson, Iggy Pop, Three Dog Night, and The Neville Brothers, yet it took him thirteen years to reach the charts himself.\r\n\r\nAs well, it nearly took him that long to find his own style. Hiatt began his solo career in 1974, and over the next decade he ran through a number of different styles from rock & roll to new wave-esque pop before he finally settled on a rootsy fusion of rock, country, blues, and folk with his 1987 album \'Bring the Family\'. Though the album didn\'t set the charts on fire, it became his first album to gain some major commercial success, and several of the songs on the record became hits for other artists, including the aforementioned Raitt and Milsap. Following its success, Hiatt became a reliable hit songwriter for other artists, and he developed a strong cult following that continued to gain strength into the mid-90s.\r\n\r\nWhile he was growing up in his hometown of Indianapolis, Indiana, Hiatt played in a number of garage bands. Initially, he was inspired by the Rolling Stones and Bob Dylan, and the music of those two artists would echo strongly throughout his work. Out of all the bar bands he played with in the late 60s, a group called The White Ducks was the one that received the most attention. Following his high-school graduation, he moved to Nashville, Tennessee at the age of 18, where he landed a job as a songwriter for Tree Publishing.\r\n\r\nFor the next several years, he wrote and performed at local clubs and hotels. Within a few years, his songs were being recorded by several different artists, including Conway Twitty, Tracy Nelson, and Three Dog Night, who took Hiatt\'s \"Sure as I\'m Sittin\' Here\" to number 16 in the summer of 1974. Eventually, his manager secured him an audition at Epic Records, and the label signed him in 1974, releasing his debut album, Hangin\' Around the Observatory, later that year. Despite their critical acclaim, neither Hangin\' Around the Observatory nor its 1975 follow-up Overcoats sold many copies, and he was dropped by the label. By the end of the year, Tree Publishing had let him go as well.\r\n\r\nFollowing his failure in Nashville, Hiatt moved out to California. By the summer of 1978 he had settled in Los Angeles, where began playing in clubs, opening for folk musicians including Leo Kottke. With Kottke\'s assistance, Hiatt hired a new manager, Denny Bruce, who helped him secure a record contract with MCA Records. Slug Line, his first record for MCA, was released in the summer of 1979. Where his first two records were straight-ahead rock & roll and folk-rock, Slug Line was in the new wave vein of angry English singer/songwriters like Elvis Costello, Graham Parker, and Joe Jackson, as if Hiatt was vying for the role of the American angry young man. The new approach earned some strong reviews, yet it failed to generate any sales. Two Bit Monsters, his second MCA album, faced the same situation. Although it was well-received critically upon its 1980 release, it made no impression on the charts, and the label dropped him.\r\n\r\nApart from working on Two Bit Monsters, Hiatt spent most of 1980 as a member of Ry Cooder\'s backing band, playing rhythm guitar on the Borderline album and touring with the guitarist. Hiatt stayed with Cooder throughout 1981, signing a new contract with Geffen Records by the end of the year. Produced by Tony Visconti (David Bowie, T. Rex), his Geffen debut All of A Sudden was released in 1982, followed by the Nick Lowe/Scott Matthews & Ron Nagel-produced Riding With the King in 1983. As with his previous records for Epic and MCA, neither of his first two Geffen releases sold well. By this time, Hiatt\'s personal life was beginning to spin out of control as he was sinking deep into alcoholism. Around the time he completed 1985\'s Warming Up to the Ice Age, his second wife committed suicide. Following the release of Warming Up to the Ice Age, Hiatt was dropped by Geffen. By the end of 1985, he had entered a rehabilitation program. During 1986, he remarried and signed a new deal with A&M Records.\r\n\r\nFor his A&M debut, Hiatt assembled a small band comprising his former associates Ry Cooder (guitar), Nick Lowe (bass), and Jim Keltner (drums). Recorded over the course of a handful of days, the resulting album, Bring the Family, had a direct, stripped-down rootsy sound that differed greatly from his earlier albums. Upon its summer 1987 release, Bring the Family received the best reviews of his career and, for once, the reviews began to pay off, as the album turned into a cult hit, peaking at 107 on the U.S. charts; it was his first charting album. Hiatt attempted to record a follow-up with Cooder, Lowe, and Keltner, but the musicians failed to agree on the financial terms for the sessions. Undaunted, he recorded an album with John Doe, David Lindley, and Dave Mattacks, but he scrapped the completed project, deciding that the result was too forced. Hiatt\'s final attempt at recording the follow-up to Bring the Family was orchestrated by veteran producer Glyn Johns, who had him record with his touring band, the Goners. Despite all of the behind-the-scenes troubles behind its recording, the follow-up album, Slow Turning, actually appeared rather quickly, appearing in the summer of 1988.\r\n\r\nSlow Turning, like Bring the Family before it, received nearly unanimous positive reviews and it was fairly well-received commercially, spending 31 weeks on the U.S. charts and peaking at 98. Within the next year, Hiatt successfully toured throughout America and Europe, strengthening his fan base along the way. Inspired by the success of Hiatt\'s two A&M albums, Geffen released the compilation Y\' All Caught? The Ones That Got Away 1979-85 in 1989. That same year, other artists began digging through Hiatt\'s catalog of songs, most notably Bonnie Raitt, who covered \"Thing Called Love\" for her multi-platinum comeback album, Nick of Time.\r\n\r\nIn 1990, Hiatt returned with Stolen Moments, which was nearly as successful as Slow Turning, both critically and commercially. \"Bring Back Your Love to Me,\" an album track from Stolen Moments that was also recorded by Earl Thomas Conley, won BMI\'s 1991 Country Music Award. By the time \"Bring Back Your Love to Me\" won that award, it had become a standard practice for artists to cover Hiatt\'s songs, as artists as diverse as Bob Dylan, Ronnie Milsap, Suzy Bogguss, and Iggy Pop all covered his songs in the early \'90s. In 1993, Rhino Records released Love Gets Strange: The Songs of John Hiatt, which collected many of the cover versions that were recorded during the \'80s and \'90s.\r\n\r\nDuring 1991, the group that recorded Bring the Family — Hiatt, Cooder, Lowe, and Keltner — re-formed as a band called Little Village, releasing their eponymous debut in early 1992. Based on the success of Bring the Family and Hiatt\'s A&M albums, expectations for Little Village were quite high, yet the record and its supporting tour were considered a major disappointment. Later, the individual members would agree that the band was a failure, mainly due to conflicting egos.\r\n\r\nHiatt decided to back away from the superstar nature of Little Village for his next album, 1993\'s Perfectly Good Guitar. Recorded in just two weeks with a backing band comprised of members of alternative rock bands School of Fish and Wire Train, the album was looser than any record since Bring the Family, but it didn\'t quite have the staying power of its two predecessors, spending only 11 weeks on the charts and peaking at number 47. The following year, he released his first live album, Hiatt Comes Alive at Budokan? Hiatt left A&M Records after the release of the record, signing with Capitol Records the following year.\r\n\r\nWalk On, Hiatt\'s first Capitol album, was recorded during his supporting tour for Perfectly Good Guitar and featured guest appearances by the Jayhawks and Bonnie Raitt. Walk On entered the charts at 48, but slipped off the charts in nine weeks, indicating that his audience had settled into a dedicated cult following. Fittingly, after 1997\'s Little Head quickly came and went in the marketplace, Hiatt parted ways with Capitol, and his next album, 2000\'s Crossing Muddy Waters was released on the established independent imprint Vanguard Records. After a second album with Vanguard, The Tiki Bar Is Open, Hiatt alligned himself with another independent label, New West, for the release of his 2003 set Beneath This Gruff Exterior. Master of Disaster, along with CD and DVD versions of Live from Austin, TX followed in 2005. \r\n\r\nSame Old Man followed in 2008; then The Open Road in 2010.\r\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/John+Hiatt\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

His first album, Too Long in the Wasteland (released in 1989), was produced by John Mellencamp and marked the beginning of a series of acclaimed projects for Columbia and Sugar Hill. In 1996, McMurtry received a Grammy nomination for his Longform Music Video of Where\'d You Hide The Body. 1997\'s It Had To Happen received the American Indie Award for Best Americana Album.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, McMurtry released the universally-lauded Live in Aught-Three on Compadre Records. 2005\'s Childish Things garnered some of the highest critical praise of McMurtry\'s career and spent six weeks at No. 1 on the Americana Music Radio Chart in 2005 and 2006. In September 2006, Childish Things and \"We Can\'t Make It Here\" won the Americana Music Awards for Album and Song of the Year, respectively. McMurtry received more Americana Music Award nominations for 2008\'s Just Us Kids.

What gets overlooked, however, is that he\'s an accomplished rock guitar player. At a sold-out Birchmere, the Austin-based artist was joined by drummer Daren Hess and bassist Ronnie Johnson in a set that demonstrated the raw power of wince-inducing imagery propelled by electric guitar.

The band is composed of brothers Caleb, Nathan and Jared Followill, and their cousin Matthew Followill. The band\'s early music was a blend of Southern rock and garage rock with blues influences, but it has evolved throughout the years to include a variety of genres and a more alternative, arena rock sound. Kings of Leon achieved initial success in the United Kingdom with nine Top 40 singles, two BRIT Awards in 2008, and all three of the band\'s albums at the time peaked in the top five of the UK Albums Chart. Their third album, Because of the Times, reached No. 1.\r\n\r\nAfter the release of Only by the Night in September 2008, the band achieved chart success in the United States. The singles \"Sex on Fire\", \"Use Somebody\", and \"Notion\" all peaked at number one on the Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart.

(Japanese: 花冷え。 Stylized: HANABIE.) is a Japanese metalcore band from Tokyo, formed in 2015. The band consists of vocalist Yukina, guitarist Matsuri, bassist Hettsu and drummer Chika. They are known for combining loud rock with contrasting Harajuku aesthetics in a style self-described as \"Harajuku-core\". Their songs incorporate elements of metalcore, hardcore punk, and nu metal, with a blend of hip hop and electronica.\r\n\r\nThe band was formed by four high school friends due to their shared admiration of Maximum the Hormone, as a part of their light music club activities. Initially a cover band, they soon transitioned into writing original music, self-producing their first single in 2016. After a period as an independent band, during which they released an album and an EP, they were signed by Epic Records Japan, a subsidiary of Sony Music Japan in 2023. In the same year, their second album Reborn Superstar! was released, ranking 24th on Billboard Japan\'s weekly album charts. The success of the album led to international recognition and appearances at various music festivals outside Japan.\r\n\r\nThe band name Hanabie. (花冷え。, \"chilly spring weather\"), is a reference to the birthdays of the four founding members, all of whom were born during winter or spring. The \" 。\" signifies progress and was adopted from the name of another band the members were fans of during their middle school years.

Freddie replaced lead vocalist Tim Staffell, after the latter\'s departure from the original trio. \r\n\r\nThere was much deliberation as to what the band\'s name would be. May and Taylor had settled upon the Grand Dance, derived from a C.S. Lewis Trilogy of books Out Of The Silent Planet.\r\n\r\nUltimately, the band went with Queen, a name that was entirely Freddie\'s. Originally Roger and, especially, Brian did not like the name, though Mercury would eventually persuade them both that it was \"right\" for the band.\r\n\r\n\"Years ago I thought up the name Queen... It\'s just a name, but it\'s very regal, and it sounds splendid. It\'s a strong name, very universal and immediate. It had a lot of visual potential and was open to all sorts of interpretations. I was certainly aware of the gay connotations, but that was just one facet of it. \"\r\n- Freddie Mercury.\r\n\r\nQueen went through several bass players before  a young electronics major by the name of John Deacon arrived on the scene in January of 1971. \r\n\r\n\"Until John, it had been exploding bass player syndrome. If they musically worked they\'d look all wrong, and if they felt all right they couldn\'t play. - Brian May.\r\n\r\nThis quite shy guy turned up with his immaculate Rickenbacker bass and immaculate amplifier, plugged in, and as soon as he started playing we realized it was right.\" - Brian May.\r\n\r\nLater that year, the band was secured recording time at the newly built De Lane Lea studio, and used the opportunity to record several songs that would later appear on their debut album - Liar, Keep Yourself Alive, Jesus, and The Night Comes Down.  The demo reel was passed around from producer to producer with little success, until a staff member of Trident records by the name of Roy Thomas Baker was introduced to the band by fellow Trident producer John Anthony. Baker dropped in to watch the band at work and, clearly liking what he heard, recommended Queen to his superiors. \r\n\r\nIt was eventually agreed upon that the fledgling band could record at Trident studios, though after already-established artists had finished their work, such as the likes of Elton John and David Bowie. Relegated to the wee hours of the morning to record the remaining tracks of their first album, the band nonetheless stuck it out until they reached their ultimate goal of \"perfection\".\r\n\r\nQueen\'s self-titled debut album was released in 1973 and received little attention from the general public. They quickly followed it a year later with a second album, \"Queen II\" which also failed to generate much interest from music fans in Britain, despite the success of the album\'s single, Seven Seas of Rhye, which would reach #10 on the charts after the band\'s mimed appearance on Top of the Pops. \r\n\r\nThe band\'s second album was recorded with a higher budget than the first, and the band threw everything they had into recording it. Queen II was somewhat of a \"concept album\", split into \"White Side\" vs. \"Black Side\". \r\n\r\nAs was in their nature, the band pressed onward after the mediocre success of their first two albums, immersing themselves in a world-wide tour to promote Queen II. Queen played in America for the first time, as a support act for Mott the Hoople.\r\n\r\nSheer Heart Attack would be released later that year, focusing more on being accessible to listeners, than the grand and complex ideas of the previous two albums. The recording of their third album was met with some hardships, as May fell victim to a series of illnesses brought on by an infected inoculation, required for the band\'s rigorous touring schedule. \r\n\r\nSheer Heart Attack brought even more success for the band, with May\'s Now I\'m Here and the song that would be the band\'s \"turning point\", the Mercury-penned Killer Queen, the latter of which would reach #2 on the UK charts.\r\n\r\nDuring this time, the band began developing a huge following in Japan and witnessed their popularity for themselves when they visited the country, mainly in 1975, to promote their fourth and most famous album \"A Night At The Opera\", featuring the epic \"Bohemian Rhapsody\".\r\n\r\nQueen\'s popularity grew steadily through the latter half of the 70s as they released hit album after hit album, reaching its peak in the mid-80s after their \"Live Aid\" appearance, and continuing into the early 90s before Mercury\'s untimely death on 24th November 1991. The official cause of death was bronchial pneumonia resulting from AIDS.\r\n\r\nOver the course of their 30 year career, the band did sound tracks for two films (\"Flash Gordon\" and \"Highlander\"), released a string of live and studio albums, and had many many fans across the world.\r\n\r\nIn 1995, 4 years after Mercury\'s death, the band released the album \"Made In Heaven\". This album saw the surviving band members in the studio completing or reworking unused vocals, unreleased variations of Freddie solo material (a Queen version of \"I Was Born To Love You\" for example), and tracks where Brian and Roger added lyrics to flesh out a song (\"Mother Love\"). \r\n\r\nQueen have been on indefinite hiatus since 1997, when John Deacon decided to retire.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral \"Queen + ...\" projects have been developed in the following years, a few of them mere remixes with no artistic involvement from the band. In 1999, a \"Greatest Hits III\" album was released. This featured, among others, \"Queen + Wyclef Jean\" on a rap version of \"Another One Bites the Dust\", a live version of \"Somebody to Love\" performed by George Michael, and a live version of \"The Show Must Go On\" performed live in 1997 with Elton John.\r\n\r\nBrian May and Roger Taylor have performed together as Queen on several occasions (award ceremonies, charity concerts, and the like), sharing vocals with various guest singers. They have also recorded several covers of Queen\'s hits with guest vocalists, including \"We Will Rock You\" (first with Five and later Britney Spears, Beyonce, John Farnham and P!nk) and \"We Are the Champions\" (with Robbie Williams).\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of May 2002 the Queen musical \'We Will Rock You\'  opened in the Dominion theatre in London\'s \'West End\'. A Musical about young people in the distant future who aren\'t allowed to listen to music not generated by computers. Various Queen songs are used in the story, played by a live band. This live band was supported by Brian May and Roger Taylor on the premiere evening.\r\n\r\nAt the end of 2004, May and Taylor announced that they would reunite and return to touring in 2005, with Paul Rodgers (founder and former lead singer of Free and Bad Company). Brian May\'s website also stated that Rodgers would be \'featured with\' Queen as \'Queen + Paul Rodgers\', not replacing Mercury. The retired John Deacon would not be participating.\r\n\r\nBetween 2005 and 2006 Queen + Paul Rodgers embarked on a world tour, the first leg in Europe and the second, Japan and then the US in 2006. On 15 August 2006, Brian May confirmed through his website and fan club that Queen + Paul Rodgers would begin producing their first studio album beginning in October, to be recorded at a \"secret location\". The album, titled The Cosmos Rocks, was released in Europe on 12 September 2008 and in the United States on 28 October 2008. Following the album the band again embarked on a tour through Europe, opening on Kharkiv\'s Freedom Square in front of 350,000 Ukrainian fans. The show in Ukraine was later released on DVD.\r\n\r\nQueen and Paul Rodgers officially split up without animosity on 12 May 2009.

Carmichael\'s music strikes a sweet spot between the Bakersfield sound of the \'60s (embraced by Merle Haggard and Buck Owens) and the outlaw style of the \'70s (think Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings), with a dash of Southern rock folded in. The product of a Kentucky family with deep roots in Southern music, Carmichael was performing professionally before he finished high school, and moved to Nashville as a songwriter just a few days after completing high school. After releasing his first single in 2017, Carmichael won the attention of fans and critics with his debut album, Hell on an Angel, in October 2018.\r\n\r\nDillon Carmichael was born in Burgin, a small town in Kentucky, and grew up with a family that was passionate about music. Both of his grandfathers, Harold Carmichael and Harold Montgomery, were professional musicians (the former was a gospel singer and the latter a country picker who appeared on the Grand Ole Opry). Both of Dillon\'s parents had been singers who often performed in public. And he also had two uncles who rose to fame in country music; John Michael Montgomery enjoyed a handful of hits in the \'90s, while Eddie Montgomery was a co-founder of the rowdy, Southern rock-inspired act Montgomery Gentry. Dillon got his first guitar from his father when he was 11 years old, and he taught himself to play. Once he became comfortable with the instrument, teenaged Dillon put together a band with his friends, and they played talent shows and informal gigs around town. The band broke up, and Carmichael struck out on his own, writing songs and playing solo shows at bars throughout Kentucky.\r\n\r\nWhen he was 18, Carmichael\'s talent came to the attention of a representative of a Nashville publishing house, who offered to strike a deal with Dillon once he graduated from high school. Four days after he got his diploma, Carmichael packed his bags and moved to Nashville, where he signed that publishing contract and began making his way into the Music City music community. As Carmichael honed his talent, his style began to reflect his early influences, which included the home truths of Merle Haggard and Waylon Jennings and the outlaw rock of Lynyrd Skynyrd. Eventually, Carmichael found a sympathetic collaborator in producer Dave Cobb, who had developed a reputation for his work with Sturgill Simpson, Jason Isbell, and Chris Stapleton. Working together in the studio, Cobb helped Carmichael cut his debut single, an homage to classic country titled \"Old Songs Like That,\" which was released in October 2017. A second single, \"Made to Be a Country Boy,\" followed in February 2018. The two singles received positive notices in the country music press, as did Carmichael\'s first full-length album, Hell on an Angel, which was released by Riser House Records in October 2018. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Dillon+Carmichael\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

She was originally an independent artist and had released an independent album, Just a Breath, in 2004. Her first studio album on Fervent Records, My Paper Heart, was released on July 22, 2008. According to the Free To Be Me Songfacts, \"Free To Be Me\" was released as the second single from the album and it shattered records in becoming the most added song by a female artist in Christian radio history and holding the #1 slot for ten consecutive weeks. Battistelli received her first Grammy Award 2009 nomination for \"Best Gospel Performance\" for the single.\r\n\r\nBetween the release of her debut album My Paper Heart and its follow-up Hundred More Years, Battistelli married Christian band percussionist Matthew Goodwin and gave birth to her first child, Matthew Elijah. According to the Hundred More Years songfacts Battistelli chose to title her sophomore record after the track \"Hundred More Years\" because the tune\'s subject matter of a couple falling in love and having their first child mimiced her own life. Hundred More Years was released on March 1, 2011.  \r\n\r\nFrancesca Battistelli is no stranger to the stage. Raised by parents immersed in the arts and Broadway, she developed a love of music, theatre, and performance at a young age. But instead of using these talents for applause and accolades, Francesca prefers to point people to something beyond herself --towards hope in Christ. Her soulful piano-pop sound resembles a blend of her music interests -- jazz, rock, gospel and R&B -- woven beautifully together with themes of trust and risk-taking. In a noisy world filled with sounds and images, we cry out for an authentic voice--one who is not afraid to speak truth and purpose to a generation. In singer/songwriter Francesca Battistelli, we have found that voice.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Francesca+Battistelli\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

In 2010, they released a three-track demo followed by a 7-inch vinyl titled \"Elizabeth\", and later their debut full-length album Opus Eponymous. The song \"Ritual\" was chosen by Kerrang! as one of \"The 50 Most Evil Songs Ever.\" The Grammis-nominated album was widely praised and significantly increased their popularity. Their second album and major label debut, Infestissumam, was released in 2013, debuted at number one in Sweden, and won the Grammis Award for Best Hard Rock/Metal Album. The band released their third studio album, Meliora, in 2015 to much critical acclaim and high record sales, reaching number one in their home country of Sweden, and number eight in the United States. Its lead single, \"Cirice\", earned them the 2016 Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance. The band released their fourth studio album, Prequelle, in 2018. The band released their fifth studio album, Impera, in 2022.\r\n\r\nGhost is easily recognizable owing greatly to its eccentric on-stage presence. Seven of the group\'s eight members, its \'Nameless Ghouls\', wear virtually identical, face-concealing costumes. Prior to a 2017 lawsuit filed by former members of the band, lead singer Tobias Forge obscured his identity behind the character \"Papa Emeritus\". The character, which consists of Forge in a prosthetic mask and makeup, can be best described as a \'demonic anti-pope\'. The Papa Emeritus Character has gone through five incarnations - I, II, III, Nihil, and IV. From the release of the 2018 album Prequelle and subsequent world tour, Forge portrayed a character known as \"Cardinal Copia\", who is described as being unrelated to any of the Papa Emeritus characters and whose costume consists of either Cardinal vestments or a black or white tuxedo alongside a prosthetic mask with black eye makeup and the multi-colored eyes which had been present in each Papa character. In March 2020, at the final show of A Pale Tour Named Death, Forge once again assumed the mantle of Papa Emeritus.\r\n\r\nGhost\'s music has been categorized in many genres, critics have classified them as hard rock, heavy metal, doom metal,  pop rock, progressive rock, psychedelic rock, occult rock, and arena rock. Adrien Begrand of PopMatters stated that Ghost recalls \"the early sounds of Black Sabbath, Pentagram, and Judas Priest, as well as the progressive and psychedelic rock of the late \'60s.\" Speaking to Noisey.com, a Nameless Ghoul described Ghost as a black metal band in the traditional sense, but said that they probably do not fit into the norms of the current black metal scene. This Nameless Ghoul described Ghost\'s music as a mix between pop music and death metal.\r\n\r\nIn an interview, a Nameless Ghoul said they are influenced by \"everything ranging from classic rock to the extreme underground metal bands of the \'80s to film scores to the grandeur of emotional harmonic music.\" A member of the band said the Swedish and Scandinavian black metal movement of the early \'90s plays a major role in their act, and said that each member has come from a metal background. However, the band has stated several times that they do not aim to be a metal band. For their second album, Ghost chose a more diverse songwriting style; a member said, \"we tried to deliberately have every song have its own signature.\"\r\n\r\nOnly a few members actually write songs. The writers compose an acoustic outline of songs before other instrumentation is added so it sounds like a group, rather than being dominated by guitar. In 2017, Forge claimed that he was the main author of every song except \"Year Zero\" and \"Zenith\", which were Persner\'s ideas. Asked how he keeps Ghost\'s sound intact despite large lineup changes, Forge said he has to teach them to play like he does; explaining that while he is a good guitar player, he is only an \"okay\" drummer, bassist and keyboardist. So it is a matter of getting them to \"underperform [laughs] together.\"\r\n\r\n2) Ghost is an experimental rock group formed in Tokyo, Japan, in 1984.\r\n\r\nCore-member Masaki Batoh grew up in Kyoto, Japan where he attended a private school. During this time, he became interested in American and British rock music ranging from Bob Dylan and Pink Floyd to the Velvet Underground and Japanese rock bands such as the Taj Mahal Travellers and the Flower Travellin\' Band.\r\n\r\nLater, Batoh formed Ghost with a large and often varying lineup. According to reports posted on Allmusic, the group lived a nomadic existence, drifting from ruins of ancient temples to disused subway stations around the Tokyo area.\r\n\r\nThe band began releasing their work with the albums Ghost and Second Time Around, which were released, respectively, in 1991 and 1992. The American independent label Drag City licensed each of the albums for distribution, and the Los Angeles The Now Sound label picked up two of Batoh\'s solo albums, released together as well under the title Collected Works. Two albums, Tune In, Turn On, Free Tibet and Snuffbox Immanence, were released simultaneously in 1999.\r\n\r\nAs well as their own work, Ghost have recorded and performed with the ex-Galaxie 500 duo Damon and Naomi. Five years after releasing both Snuffbox Immanence and Tune In, Turn On, Free Tibet, Ghost returned with Hypnotic Underworld, and there were some changes in the band. Cellist Hiromichi Sakamoto and percussionist Setsuko Furuya left and were replaced by a rhythm section of Takuyuki Moriya (electric bass guitar, double bass, and cello) and Junzo Tateiwa (drums, tabla, and percussion). In January 2007, Ghost released its latest studio album titled In Stormy Nights.\r\n\r\n3)  A British hip hop/trip hop/electronic producer on the Breakin Bread label who has an impressive discography dating back to 2003. Their body of work includes three solo albums, a collaborative group album, a dynamic mix CD, a series of 12-inch vinyl releases, captivating EPs, and two digital download albums filled with remixes and unreleased tracks. Ghost has left an indelible mark on the music scene through extensive touring, while also maintaining a strong presence as a skillful DJ and a regular radio performer.\r\n\r\nInitially rooted in the world of Hip Hop as a dedicated enthusiast (a passion that endures), Ghost\'s artistic evolution over the past eight years has been noteworthy. This period has seen a deliberate expansion of musical horizons, embracing genres beyond Hip Hop. Notably, Ghost has delved into the realms of Wonky, Electronic beats, Future Beats, and Bass, demonstrating an impressive versatility that resonates with diverse audiences.\r\n\r\nhttps://ghost-uk.bandcamp.com\r\n\r\n4) The collaboration between one of Dubstep\'s forefathers El-B and J Da Flex, they created a darker, rawer offshoot of UK Garage on a label of the same name, that would ultimately pave the way for the sound of Dubstep.

Their lyrics cover many subjects / feelings, with the same level of sophistication that their music shows, plus honesty. They usually write songs in Spanish, sometimes in English or a combination of both languages.\r\n\r\nThey began as a band in 1994; as time went by, the band changed members several times until the definite lineup stuck in 1997 with León Larregui (vocals and guitar), Sergio Acosta (guitar), Beto Cabrera (drums), Ángel Mosqueda (bass) and Chucho Báez (keyboards). Then the band made a demo and many gigs on their own with the little resources that they had; with all that, Zoé began to call the attention of the hispanic radio stations in the U.S. Later in 1998, Zoé signed a record deal with Sony Music Mexico and began making their first record in 2000; this album, self titled, came out and quickly became a favorite of the audience in Mexico; after that, the band performed songs in soundracks of movies such as \'Amar Te Duele\', \'Ladies Night\' and \'The Dreamer\'.\r\n\r\nFast forward to 2003. Zoé, along with producer Phil Vinall (Placebo, Elastica, Pulp), recorded their second album called \'Rocanlover\', which became more successful than the first one thanks to hit songs like \'Peace & Love\' and \'Veneno\', which aired in several TV countdowns.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, after three years of working together, Zoé left Sony Music because of the lack of real interest that this record label had in them and signed a new deal with Noiselab; with a newfound belief in record labels, Zoé made an EP called \'The Room\', which debuted at the top of the rankings in Mexico. This EP includes, among others, the song \'Dead\' (first single); also,are including \"She Comes\" and \"Morning Watts\" as new songs  and also some remixes of \"Dead\" by great electronic artists from Mexico such as Sonido Lasser Drakkar or Los Dynamite, plus a couple of videos.\r\n\r\nOn July 12th, 2006; Zoé (now wih Rodrigo Guardiola in the drums) presented their more recent production, \"Memo Rex Commander y el Corazón atómico de la Vía Láctea\", a sophisticate, layered production, which tops several magazines\' rankings. Both Zoé and producer Phil Vinall worked very hard in Tornillo, Texas, a remote town in the desert, to get \"Memo Rex\" finished.\r\n\r\nIn fall 2006, Zoé headlined the Rockampeonato Tour, along with other Noiselab signees like Los Dynamite and Los Odio!, which held shows at cities like Mérida, Guadalajara and many others. This is the biggest tour Zoé has been a part of since they were formed.\r\n\r\nIn 2007 Zoé recorded \"281107\", a live album that celebrates their first 10 years as a band, it was recorded on the Palacio de los Deportes in Mexico City, this recording went platinum pretty quickly which is something unusual for live recordings in Mexico. On November 11th 2008 \"Repileptric\" Zoé\'s seventh studio album was released.\r\n\r\n2) An alias of Zoë Pollock (b. in Peckham, London, UK - aka Zoë, Zoe, Hepzibah Broom & Pollack), is a pop / rock / folk singer who began her career in the mid-80s, dated Martin Glover (aka Youth, who produced her early work), released three solo albums (two as Zoë, another as Hepzibah Broom) & several singles.

Originally from Canterbury, the quartet moved to Brighton and started playing in earnest. Originally comprised of Devin Yuceil (lead vocals, guitar), Glen Hodgson (vocals/guitar), Maria Sullivan (vocals/bass) and Adam Brodigan (vocals, drums), Delta Sleep released their self-titled debut EP in 2010 before signing to Big Scary Monsters, which put out the follow-up Management in 2013.

She is also known for pioneering the genre dariacore under her side-project leroy  (a.k.a. c0ncernn). Jane grew up with her parents and twin sister in northern New Jersey.\r\n\r\nJane Remover\'s interest in music production stems back as far as 2011, inspired by dubstep producers like Skrillex, Kill The Noise, and Virtual Riot. She would later go on to produce different styles of EDM in the mid-2010s, citing Porter Robinson as her biggest influence. From electronic music, Jane\'s production became more trap-centric in around 2018; she cited artists such as Trippie Redd, Earl Sweatshirt, and Tyler, the Creator as inspirations. Guest production then became a large part of Jane\'s early career, with her being a member of multiple SoundCloud collectives such as PlanetZero and graveem1nd. Her production gradually became more digicore oriented.\r\n\r\nIn early 2020, Jane began self-producing and releasing her own works on SoundCloud. One of Jane\'s first solo releases, \"what\'s my age again?\", gained popularity after being shared on Twitter. Her first project, the extended play Teen Week, was released on February 26, 2021. The track \"homeswitcher\" reached 100,000 streams on SoundCloud within the first two weeks of its release.\r\n\r\nAfter the release of several more one-off singles, Jane began teasing the release of her first full-length album, Frailty, and releasing singles for it in June 2021. After the release of the tracks \"how to lie\", \"pretender\", and \"search party\", Frailty was released via the deadAir label on November 12, 2021. The album was acclaimed by publications such as Pitchfork, who placed the album at #47 on their list of the best albums of 2021 and #33 on their list of the best albums from the early 2020s.\r\n\r\nOn June 27, 2022, Jane announced the retirement of her previous pseudonym, transition of her gender, and introduced the name Jane Remover. On the same date, she released the single \"Royal Blue Walls\". In Jane\'s statement, she said \"the stage name [insert] has never sat right with [her]\" and that it \"reminds [her] of a period of [her] life [she\'d] like to move past\". She also announced that the Teen Week EP would be abridged, as she was uncomfortable with the project as it was originally released. This change went into effect on October 10, 2022, when four songs were removed from the project.\r\n\r\nJane\'s second single released as Jane Remover, \"Contingency Song\", was released on November 16, 2022. She was the opening act for brakence\'s Hypochondriac tour from November 26 to December 22, 2022.\r\n\r\nJane released her single \"Lips\" on August 23rd, 2023. The day the song released, Jane also announced her second full-length album, Census Designated. The album has 10 tracks, including an  \"Album Version\" of her song \"Contingency Song\", and a remastered, extended version of \"Cage Girl.\" The second single and title track to the album released on September 20th alongside her first music video as Jane Remover, directed by Quadeca. The album released on October 20th, 2023.\r\n\r\nJane has released music under many pseudonyms throughout her career. The most notable of these aliases is leroy (used interchangeably with c0ncernn), under which she created sample-heavy EDM mashups, spanning for three albums. These releases sampled a wide range of sounds, including pop songs of the 2010s, viral videos, and even her own music. The cover art for each song released under the leroy moniker was a screenshot from the TV series Daria, which led to the term \"dariacore\" being used to describe the unique production style that Jane used for these releases. Three compilation albums of the forty tracks uploaded were released on the account from December 2020 to May 2022.  A fourth album titled \"Grave Robbing\" initially aired on NTS Radio on July 20th 2023, later being released on the leroy SoundCloud. The description of the album indicates that it will most likely be the last released under that alias.  The \"dariacore\" series of albums have since inspired many artists to adopt a similar style of production, releasing short sample-based EDM tracks on SoundCloud themed around popular media. Venturing is a ficticious band that Jane Remover made up and released music under. Its music has a very different sound than her initial work, being a fusion of rock ,  slowcore,  ambient, and  shoegaze. The backstory for Venturing is that it was an American rock band, formed in Britton, South Dakota in 1990. The band went through a total of six members: Steve Dales on the drums, Barney Cruz on the bass, Fawn, Vonnie Fitz and Daisy Knight on the guitars, and Melanie Dizzy, who sang. The band disbanded in 2002 shortly after the untimely death of their drummer, Stephen \"Steve\" Dales. In a Reddit AMA on /r/indieheads, Jane said she was \"totally done with side projects at this point,\" and in response to a user asking if there were any that people didn\'t know about, she said \"No!! and a lot of them that ppl think ARE me, are not.

Following are six, listed in order of prominence:\r\n\r\n1) Nirvana was a popular and highly influential American grunge band. The band formed in Aberdeen, Washington in 1987, and it was part of the Seattle grunge scene of the late 80s, alongside bands like Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains and Soundgarden. As their popularity rose, alternative rock became a dominant genre on American and Canadian radio and music television during the early-to-mid \'90s.\r\n\r\nIn late 1987, Cobain and Novoselic recruited drummer Aaron Burckhard (1987–1988).The three practiced material from Cobain\'s Fecal Matter tape.  After losing contact with Burckhard, the pair instead practised with Dale Crover of the Melvins, and Nirvana recorded its first demos in January 1988. Their first single, a cover version of \"Love Buzz\", a song by Dutch group \'Shocking Blue\', was released in November 1988 on the Seattle independent record label Sub Pop. Their debut album, \'Bleach\', was produced by Jack Endino and released in June 1989. Later that year, the band recorded the \'Blew EP\' with producer Steve Fisk.\r\n\r\nAt the start of the new decade, the band commenced their first recording sessions to the follow-up album with producer Butch Vig, substituted their drummer by Dave Grohl and signed to DGC Records. The result, \'Nevermind\', would eventually sell over seven million copies in the United States, and over 30 million worldwide.\r\n\r\nIn early 1993, Nirvana released \"Puss\"/\"Oh, the Guilt\", a split single with The Jesus Lizard, on the independent label Touch & Go. Meanwhile, the group chose Steve Albini as the producer to record its third album. \'In Utero\' debuted at number one on the Billboard album chart in September the same year. \r\n\r\nAs Nirvana\'s frontman, Cobain found himself referred to in the media as the \"spokesman of a generation\", with Nirvana the \"flagship band\" of \"Generation X\", their third studio album \'In Utero\' was considered to be a conscious attempt to shed their audience. While Nirvana\'s mainstream popularity waned in the months following its release, their core audience cherished the band\'s dark interior, particularly after their 1993 performance on MTV Unplugged with the Meat Puppets, a band that Cobain had always idolised, performing with them the songs Oh, Me, Plateau and Lake of Fire. It was later released and topped the charts in 1994.\r\n\r\nNirvana\'s brief run ended with the suicide of Cobain in 1994, but the band\'s popularity expanded in the years that followed. Eight years after Cobain\'s death, \"You Know You\'re Right\", an unfinished demo that the band recorded two months prior to Cobain\'s death, topped radio playlists around the world. Since their debut, the band has sold more than fifty million albums worldwide, including more than ten million copies of Nevermind in the US alone. Nirvana remains a consistent presence on radio stations worldwide.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, the box set \"With the Lights Out\", a collection of radio sessions, home demos, studio demos and outtakes, was released. A year later, \"Sliver: The Best Of The Box\" was released, a compilation of selected \"WTLO\" tracks, but with 3 new tracks including a track from the famous \"Fecal Matter\" demo.\r\n\r\nBand members: Kurt Cobain - vocals, guitar (1987–1994), Krist Novoselic - bass (1987–1994) Dave Grohl - drums, vocals (1990–1994)\r\n\r\nPrior members:Aaron Burckhard - drums (1987–1988), Dale Crover - drums (1988, 1990),  Dave Foster - drums (1988), Chad Channing - drums (1988–1990), Jason Everman - guitar (1989), Dan Peters - drums (1990)\r\n\r\nTouring members: Pat Smear - guitar (1993–1994), Lori Goldston - cello (1993–1994), Melora Creager - cello (1994)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n2) Nirvana is a UK-based progressive rock band formed in 1967, primarily active in the late 1960s and early 1970s - and still sporadically active to the present day.\r\n\r\nThe band was formed in the summer of 1967 in an era when melodic pop/rock music with baroque and chamber arrangements and instrumentation was highly-prized. The band, consisted of two songwriter/performers - Greek-born Alex Spyropoulos and Irish-born Patrick Campbell-Lyons who met in London. They produced a number of singles (notably \"Rainbow Chaser\", \"Pentecost Hotel\", and \"Tiny Goddess\") for the fledgling Island Records label.\r\n\r\nThe band was signed by Island Records\' founder Chris Blackwell in the era when he also signed the bands Traffic and Free. \r\n\r\nIn October 1967 the band released its first album - a concept album produced by Blackwell titled The Story of Simon Simopath. The album was probably the first narrative concept album ever released - predating story-driven concept albums such as The Pretty Things\' S.F. Sorrow (December 1968), The Who\'s Tommy (April 1969) and The Kinks\' Arthur (September 1969).\r\n\r\nMusically, the group blended myriad musical styles including rock, pop, folk, jazz, Latin rhythms and classical music - primarily augmented by baroque chamber-style arrangements to create a unique entity.\r\n\r\nThe next year 1968 their follow-up album, All Of Us, featured a similar broad range of musical styles. Their third album To Markos III was released on the Pye label in 1969.\r\n\r\nIn 1971 the duo amicably separated for a while, with Campbell-Lyons the primary contributor to the next two Nirvana albums, Local Anaesthetic 1971, and Songs Of Love And Praise 1972. Campbell-Lyons subsequently worked as a solo artist and issued further albums: Me And My Friend 1973, Electric Plough 1981, and The Hero I Might Have Been 1983 though these did not enjoy commercial success.\r\n\r\nThe band reunited in 1985, successfully touring Europe and releasing a compilation album Black Flower 1987 containing some new material. (Black Flower had been the provisional title of their third album.) In the 1990s two further albums were released. Secret Theatre 1994 compiled rare tracks and demos, while Orange And Blue 1996 contained previously unreleased material including a tongue-in-cheek cover of the song \"Lithium\" originally recorded by the American grunge band Nirvana who released its first album in 1989, and who the band had successfully sued over use of the name Nirvana. The undisclosed terms of the settlement has apparently allowed the original Nirvana to continue using its name and issuing new recordings.\r\n\r\nIn 1999 the band released a three-disc CD anthology titled \"Chemistry\" including several previously-unreleased tracks and some new material.\r\n\r\nTop musicians who played on Nirvana sessions include: Lesley Duncan, Herbie Flowers, Billy Bremner (later of Rockpile/Dave Edmunds fame), Luther Grosvenor, Wynder K. Frogg, Clem Cattini and the full lineup of rock band Spooky Tooth.\r\n\r\nThe group was in the school of baroque-flavored, melodic pop-rock music typified by The Beatles of \"Rubber Soul\" and \"Revolver\", The Beach Boys of Pet Sounds and God Only Knows, the Zombies of Odessey and Oracle and Time Of The Season, the Procol Harum of A Whiter Shade Of Pale, the Moody Blues of Days of Future Passed and Nights In White Satin and The Kinks of Waterloo Sunset. The majority of the tracks on Nirvana\'s albums fall into that broad genre of contemporary popular music - not easily categorized - but perhaps best described as the baroque or chamber strand of \"progressive rock, soft rock or \"orchestral pop\".\r\n\r\nTheir first three albums were reissued on CD by Universal in 2003 and received critical acclaim. In 2005 Universal (Japan) reissued Local Anaesthetic and Songs Of Love And Praise.\r\n\r\nAs of late 2005 the founding members Alex Spyropoulos and Patrick Campbell-Lyons are still sporadically writing and recording.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n3) Nirvana was a short-lived Finnish punk band formed in 1980, whose sole release was a 7\" vinyl with tracks \"Kielletyt leikit\" and \"Kuljen kaupungilla\" with 200 pressings.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n4) Nirvana was a Dutch pop group, formed in 1985 by producers Bernard Oattes and Rob van Schaik. The group consisted of Anthony Moendir, Frits Broekrits and Annie Alberti and have released one single, \"Say When\", which became a big hit. The group split up in 1987.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n5) Nirvana is a side project of The Skaters\' James Ferraro.

Foo Fighters was initially formed as a one-man project by former Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl. Following the success of the eponymous debut album, Grohl (lead vocals, guitar) recruited a band consisting of Nate Mendel (bass guitar), William Goldsmith (drums), and Pat Smear (guitar). After a succession of lineup changes, including the departures of Goldsmith and Smear, the band formed its core lineup in 1999 consisting of Grohl, Mendel, Chris Shiflett (guitar), and Taylor Hawkins (drums). In 2005 Smear returned to the band and in 2017 Rami Jaffee joined the band performing the keyboards and piano.\r\n\r\nPrior to the release of Foo Fighters\' 1995 debut album Foo Fighters, which featured Grohl as the only official member, Grohl recruited bassist Nate Mendel and drummer William Goldsmith, both formerly of Sunny Day Real Estate, as well as Nirvana touring guitarist Pat Smear. The band began with performances in Portland, Oregon. Goldsmith quit during the recording of their second album, The Colour and the Shape (1997); most of the drum parts were re-recorded by Grohl. Smear departed soon afterward but appeared as a guest with the band frequently from 2005; he rejoined in 2010.\r\n\r\nSmear and Goldsmith were replaced by Franz Stahl and Taylor Hawkins; Stahl was fired before the recording of the group\'s third album, There Is Nothing Left to Lose (1999). The band briefly continued as a trio until Chris Shiflett joined on guitar after the completion of There Is Nothing Left to Lose. Foo Fighters released their fourth album, One by One, in 2002. It was followed with the two-disc In Your Honor (2005), which was split between acoustic songs and heavier material. Foo Fighters released their sixth album, Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace, in 2007.\r\n\r\nFor Foo Fighters\' seventh studio album, Wasting Light (2011), produced by Butch Vig, Smear returned as a full member. Sonic Highways (2014) was released as the soundtrack to the television miniseries directed by Grohl. Concrete and Gold (2017) was the second Foo Fighters album to reach number one in the United States and their first studio album to feature longtime session and touring keyboardist Rami Jaffee as a full member.

Rooted in hardcore punk and melodic hardcore, Rise Against\'s music emphasizes melody, catchy hooks, an aggressive sound and playstyle, and rapid tempos. Lyrically, the band is known for their outspoken social commentary, covering a wide range of topics such as political injustice, animal rights, humanitarianism, and environmentalism.\r\n\r\nThe band spent its first four years signed to the independent record label Fat Wreck Chords, on which they released two studio albums, The Unraveling (2001) and Revolutions per Minute (2003). Both the albums were met with underground success, and in 2003 the band signed with the major label Dreamworks, which was absorbed by Geffen. Rise Against\'s major label debut Siren Song of the Counter Culture (2004) brought the band mainstream success, largely in part to the popularity of the singles \"Give It All\" and \"Swing Life Away\". The band\'s next album, The Sufferer & the Witness (2006), peaked at number ten on the Billboard 200 in the United States, and was Rise Against\'s first album to chart in countries outside of North America.\r\n\r\nWith the release of Appeal to Reason (2008), Rise Against\'s music shifted toward a more accessible and radio-friendly sound, with greater emphasis on production value. The album\'s third single, \"Savior\", broke the record for the most consecutive weeks spent on both the Hot Rock Songs and Alternative Songs charts.

In 2007, they recorded and released their first full length album \"No Time for Rest\" at Castaway 7 Studios in Ventura, Ca, which featured one of the last recorded performances by reggae legend Mikey Dread. Their single “Cookie Jar” reached number one in Hawaii on 93.9 DaBeat and was featured on Fuel TV’s Triple Crown of Surfing recap. Their music was also featured on MTV shows Maui Fever and Living Lahaina.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, they embarked on a US national tour titled “Playboys in Paradise” in support of the band Pepper. They also recently recorded four new songs, two of which were co-written by Grammy Award Winner Charles Brotman. They continue to tour extensively and look forward to bringing their sound to an even larger audience.\r\nAlbums:\r\n2006 - New Roots ep\r\n2007 - No Time for Rest album\r\n2008 - Sample This ep\r\n2010 - Time Bomb album\r\n2011 - Fresh Grounds ep\r\n\r\n(2) Iration is a roots reggae band composed by three brothers which begins in the heart of the Caribbean and marks the spiritual birth of their musical talent. They arrived on the island of Montserrat in the West Indies in October of 1973 as exiles of the Pinochet government and in 1981 they migrated to the United States of America. Iration was born in early 1983 and their first performance was at Ramapo High School\'s 1986 Talent Show in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey. Iration began playing college circuits in the US such as Bucknell University in Pennsylvania, Upsala College, The Bronx, Fort Lee etc. They frequently played at local pubs wirthin the Tri-State area and a leg of the Reggae Sunsplash in Greensboro, North Carolina on Sept. 21st, 1991 opening up for J.C. Lodge, Mojo Nya, Truth and Rights and Art Awareness Ensemble.\r\n \r\nIn April of 1992 they landed in Kingston, Jamaica to record their first single titled “The Day After” published by Mission 101 Records. Iration is the first reggae group to have recorded professionally under this name and they performed live at the Midnite Ravers show in NYC & were interviewed at the Hapte Selassie show on WBAI Pacifica Radio FM.  The single \"The Day After\" received extensive airplay throughout the caribbean radio programs in Manhattan, Queens and The Bronx including 1190 AM.\r\n\r\nIn mid 1993 Iration returned to their native land to promote their single extensively and this visit unexpectedly became a semi-permanent one.  It was a time of tension where most who rerturned from exile were called \"retornados\" and music quickly became the source of inspiration to cope with this short lived social critique.  Iration managed to place the single \r\n\"The Day After\" within the programming of most local radio stations and including as far away as Concepcion in the southern part of Chile. Reggae music was now introduced into the mainstream radio audiences and during this period of time Iration naturally began to compose in spanish.  This musical journey took them into an independent run into the Chilean underground cultural scene. Reggae music began to flourish and due to these circumstances in 1996 the \"Reggae Report\" magazine (USA) provided a pretty in depth look into the local reggae scene in Chile at that time (Vol. 14 # 3) and a brief review of the several emerging groups at that time and this brief summary on the talents of Iration: \r\n\r\n \"Iration is a completely different story.  Three brothers: Mario (keyboards), Patricio (bass), and Gino Zamorano (drums) make up the most experienced band of the force, and perhaps the best as well.  They moved with their parents to Montserrat in 1973 as political exiles of the Pinochet government.  There they grew  up with Reggae and other Caribbean rhythms.  They then moved to New York in early 1990.  Iration has played on the college circuit in the U.S. and has recorded a single in Jamaica in 1993.  Moving to their beloved home country in late \'94, they established themselves as the leading rhythm section in the country.  Now they are rehearsing material for their debut album to be recorded this summer\". Iration became the standard in the sense that they were performing with a full band including a brass section and backing vocals, something not seen asa yet in their country within this genre.  At that time being independent was viewed as an ultimate suicide but they took on this challenge, giving many interviews on radio, television (mostly culturally oriented program) exposing the mission of reggae music and even turned down a deal with the transnational conglomerate of Sony Music. Iration was performing what was considered as non commercial music and had no airplay, plus their was the fact of their strong lyrical content, so they worked extensively with community radios and performed at many schools for the youth. Looking at the positive side of their music these conditions ultimately gave them the freedom to speak their minds without any limitations and cemented a strong foundation for the upcoming reggae groups in Chile.\r\n\r\nIration began playing in most local clubs in Santiago such as the Rockola, La Ozz, Subte Discotheque, Caribbean and Boomerang just to name a few.  This was another challenge that was conquered within a reasonable amount of time by Iration even though reggae music was not even popular within this geographical area. It was years of hard work that made Iration a unique underground sensation, they eventually met the grand Dennis Stone a.k.a \"DreadStone\" who opened up Chile\'s first reggae and apparel store named \"Reggae Centro\" in which the youths were intimately exposed for the first time to a very broad variety of reggae music. \r\n\r\nDennis Stone has been involved in the REGGAE music biz for over 25 years, started back in the early 80\'s with his Dreadstone Sound System, NYC (selling his exclusive Dreadstone mixtapes out of VP Records as well as on the streets of manhattan).  He later formed BigUp Entertainment with partner Russell Javors in 1990 - managed, produced, promoted artists in Jamaica, US, South America, etc. Dennis has contributed to multiple Gold Record and Grammy nominated Reggae projects including the soundtrack for Disney\'s \"Cool Runnings\" film, also co-owned DownUnder Studios in S. Florida with producer Henry K, specializing in Reggae, Hiphop and R&B music. DREADSTONE is also the former manager for Tony Rebel (as well as executive producer for Rebel\'s acclaimed \"Vibes Of The Times\" album on Chaos/Columbia).  His production team delivered Diana King\'s demo and first U.S. release \"Stir It Up\" for Columbia/Sony and assisted in structuring the Stir It Up Tour and the Grammy nominated \"Stir It Up\" compilation, also for Columbia/Sony.  He has been associated with many fine artists such as Prezident Brown, Calton Coffie, Tony Curtis, Jigsy King, Professor Frisky, Nadine Sutherland, Garnet Silk, Uton Green, Ninja Man, Diana King, Bradley Brown, Rythmation, Iration, Gondwana, Roland Alphonso, Fiona, Delly Ranks, Deuteronomy, Natty Remo, Bigga Staar, Magano and many others.  \r\nDREADSTONE has worked alongside Sly Dunbar, Bobby Digital, Steven Stanley, Henry K, Donovan Germaine, Barry O\'Hare, the Kelly Bros., Philip Smart, Courtney Cole, Clive Chin, Kirk Hedge and many other great Reggae Producers as well as Irie FM\'s popular Mighty Mike Jones.  He established \"Reggae Centro\" in Santiago, Chile in 1998 and promoted Reggae Thursdays at Boomerang in downtown Santiago, featuring Chile\'s premier reggae band \"Iration\".\r\n\r\nCurrently based in S. FL, producing and promoting talented reggae artists such as singer/songwriter/drummer Bradley Brown, as well as ongoing projects with established artists such as Carlton Coffie (the original JA Bad Boy), and upcoming singjay artist Adam \"Teacha\" Barnes.  Recording and mixing at Vybetribe Studio in S.FL as well as out of Barry O\'Hare\'s World-A-Muzic Studio located in the historic Jack Ruby yard, Ocho Rios, JA with boomshot engineer/producer Kirk Hedge.  He is also currently collaborating with riddim-kings Heddrokk Productions in Miami.  Sourcing nuff dubplates from the JA young~maestro \"YelloKid\" himself (BIGUP YELLO!) and assisting House/Electro producer/DJ extraordinaire Austin Leeds with ongoing projects.  Continuing to forward great Reggae Music with a focus on Culture/Conscious Vibes. \r\n\r\nIration in 1997 soon followed to pursue the recording of their material and moved to New York City for 3 years. On their return to Chile they became the opening act for groups like Los Pericos, The Wailers, Lauryn Hill, Fabulosos Cadillacs, Auténticos Decadentes and Matisyahu. They were chosen as backing band for the performances of Kymani Marley and Andrew Tosh on their first visit to Chile. In September of 2003 Iration was invited by Isabel Allende to participate in the Tribute to Salvador Allende “El Sueño Existe” sharing the scene with artistes such as Silvio Rodriguez, Shalil Shankar, Vicente Feliú, Gerardo Alfonso, Los Prisioneros, Daniela Mercury, Julieta Venegas, Salvador Ojeda, León Gieco, Gilberto Gil, Daniel Viglietti, Congreso, Quilapayún, César Isella & Pedro Aznar. This was one of their best performances up to date and attendance at this tribute was around 80,000 +. Their message is clear and being an underground sensation definitely helped them stay in the cultural eyes of their people. \r\n\r\nBy late 2003 Warner Music Chile releases the album “Fusion de Estilos 2“ by the Hip-Hop group “Zaturno & Tapia Rabia” in which Iration composes and performs the first single “Cuando te veo pasar” of the album, the video clip aired on MTV Latino in late September and incorporated the talents of Quique Galdames of the group Illapu.  Iration by now had established themselves with enough exposure and basic financing to begin preparations to remix & upgrade addecuately their first album now titled “En Exilio / In Exile” and begin the task of making their first video clip for the song “Chile”, a classic example of their talent and quality of composition. \r\nIration’s album “En Exilio / In Exile” has musicians from the U.S.A., Cuba and Chile such as Rich Tozzoli, David Brian Ondrick (USA), Lino Borbolla, Jose Ismael Gomez (Cuba), Francisco Martinez, Ruben Salgado, Loretto Canales, Karen Vergara, Damian Bodenhofer, Fabian Cordova and Efrain Rodriguez (Chile) creating a nice blend of different styles within their music. It clearly has a Caribbean flavor with a slight South American touch and their music represents their conviction to spiritually fight for a better tomorrow, leaving clear that the most important value is to be part of the solution by just simply giving \"love\". \r\n\r\nIration programmed and performed at various venues during the summer of 2008 in the United States, which kicked off at the 1st Annual Budweiser Reggae Summerfest @ RFK Stadium in DC accompanying a line-up of artistes such as Iwayne, Kymani Marley, Turbulence, Beres Hamond, Etana, Chuck Fender and Ruth among others. It is from this platform that they embarked on promoting the worldwide release of their album \"En Exilio / In Exile\".  Also released was the single \"Amor Eres Tu\" - 2009 and \"Instrumental\" - Christmas/New Year 2010 which are all available online @ limewirestore, itunes, amazon, rhapsody, napster, emusic, lala, shockhound, imvu, nokia and amiestreet.com \r\n\r\nIration means creation in the patois dialect which is spoken in most of the Caribbean islands where english is the primary language. \r\n\r\nFor inquiries on booking & available dates: irationmusic@gmail.com\r\n\r\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Iration\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The band consists of Robin Pecknold (vocals, guitar), Skyler Skjelset (guitar, mandolin, backing vocals), Casey Wescott (keyboards, mandolin, backing vocals), Christian Wargo (bass, guitar, backing vocals) and Morgan Henderson (upright bass, guitar, woodwinds, violin, percussion, saxophone).\r\n\r\nLed by singer-songwriter Robin Pecknold, the band came to prominence in 2008 with the release of their second EP Sun Giant and their debut album Fleet Foxes on Sub Pop. Both received critical praise and reviewers often noted the band\'s use of refined lyrics and vocal harmonies. Fleet Foxes\' second studio album Helplessness Blues was released on Sub Pop in 2011. Following a hiatus between 2013 and 2016, during which Pecknold pursued an undergraduate degree, Fleet Foxes reunited to record their third album, Crack-Up, released on Nonesuch Records in 2017. The band\'s fourth album, Shore, was released on Anti- in September 2020.\r\n\r\nFormation and early years (2005–06)\r\nRobin Pecknold and Skyler Skjelset both attended Lake Washington High School in Kirkland, a suburb of Seattle, and soon became close friends. Pecknold and Skjelset bonded over an appreciation of Bob Dylan and Neil Young and began making music together. Their parents influenced their musical tastes early on—Skjelset\'s mother Peggi was a keen listener to both Dylan and Hank Williams while Pecknold\'s father Greg was a member of The Fathoms, a local 1960s soul group. The two shared an interest in the music of Dylan and Brian Wilson. Pecknold played bass for Seattle\'s Dolour on a US tour in 2005, shortly before forming the first incarnation of Fleet Foxes.\r\n\r\nOriginally going by the name \"The Pineapples\", a name clash with another local band prompted a change and Pecknold decided upon \"Fleet Foxes\", suggesting that it was \"evocative of some weird English activity like fox hunting\". Pecknold took up the role of principal songwriter, both singing and playing guitar, while Skjelset played lead guitar. The original lineup was filled out by Casey Wescott on keyboards and backing vocals, Bryn Lumsden on bass and Nicholas Peterson on drums and backing vocals.\r\n\r\nPecknold\'s late-sixties pop style caught the attention of the Seattle producer Phil Ek and he helped them record their first demo in 2006, the self-released Fleet Foxes EP. Ek was impressed with the band\'s songwriting, and on hearing Pecknold for the first time, noted, \"It was obvious he had talent coming out of his ass.\" By late 2006 the Seattle press began to take notice of the band; Tom Scanlon of the Seattle Times stated that he was impressed with the band\'s lyrics and musical maturity. By the end of the year, Lumsden had been replaced on bass by Craig Curran, who would also handle many of the band\'s vocal harmonies.\r\n\r\nWith growing popularity on the local circuit, the band set about making their first album in early 2007, spending time in the studio with producer Ek in addition to recording material at home. However, funds for recording were tight, so the band members cobbled together what funds they had, which limited the time they had in the studio, and so the majority of the tracks were recorded in various band members\' apartments, other spaces, or the basement of Pecknold\'s parents\' house.\r\n\r\nSun Giant and Fleet Foxes (2007–08)\r\nFleet Foxes were becoming increasingly popular and by late 2007, they had attracted over a quarter of a million song plays over two months on their Myspace site. Although the band had not released any of their recordings, they benefited from word of mouth exposure and their success soon translated into a record deal, signing with Warner Music subsidiary record label Sub Pop on January 18, 2008. According to Sub Pop\'s A&R, Sue Busch, at the time of signing the band was still a relatively primitive set-up, being without manager or legal representation. Robin\'s sister Aja Pecknold then assumed the role of band manager. The band\'s frontman, Robin Pecknold, attributes much of their success and popularity to illegal file sharing.\r\n\r\nThe band tracked their second EP, Sun Giant, at Bear Creek Studio and performed overdubs and mixed at Seattle\'s Avast! Recording Co., around the same time in preparation for upcoming tours. Fleet Foxes began their spring tour with another Northwest band Blitzen Trapper on February 28, 2008. Before the recording of the EP, bassist Curran was replaced by Christian Wargo, whose voice, like that of his predecessor, would become an important part of the band\'s harmony blend. The band\'s performances, first at the SXSW festival in March 2008, and then the Sasquatch! festival in May 2008, moved the band into the public consciousness, notably attracting attention from the European press for the first time.\r\n\r\nSun Giant was released internationally on April 8, 2008 and the group\'s brand of folk, rock and pop, marked by their use of vocal harmonies, was well received by the press. Despite the warm critical reception, the group said that the EP did not represent their full ambitions, serving merely as a CD to sell while on tour. In May 2008, the band chose to extend their North American and European tour until September in support of their forthcoming album. At this time Josh Tillman replaced Peterson on drums and backing vocals. Their first full-length album, Fleet Foxes, was released shortly afterwards on June 3, 2008. The album achieved similar critical success as the previous EP. Fleet Foxes received four out of five stars from Rolling Stone, which compared it to the likes of the Beach Boys, Animal Collective, and Crosby, Stills & Nash, and a 9.0 out of 10 in a review by Pitchfork Media, sharing the website\'s album of the year rank with the Sun Giant EP. The Guardian was particularly complimentary, awarding the album five stars and declaring it \"a landmark in American music — an instant classic\". On June 24, 2008, Fleet Foxes went to No. 1 on the CMJ Radio 200 Chart. The album achieved an average rating of 87/100 from 30 critic reviews on the aggregator website Metacritic.\r\n\r\nWhile the group enjoyed moderate success in the United States, Fleet Foxes was better received in Europe, selling over 200,000 copies in the five months following its release. The sales were matched with critical plaudits and their debut album won Uncut\'s first ever Music Award 2008 prize. Uncut\'s editor, Allan Jones, said the album \"showed impeccable musicianship, and although you could trace its antecedents, it sounded totally unique. Fleet Foxes was just a glorious debut.\" The band sold out music venues for their tours of Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, reaffirming their growing popularity.\r\n\r\nAt the end of 2008, Fleet Foxes was rated album of the year by Billboard\'s Critic\'s Choice and in Metacritic\'s end of year best album round-up it appeared in 17 lists, topping six of them. Furthermore, it had sold over 408,000 copies in North America and over 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom, making it the first gold certificate record for UK label Bella Union. Their growing profile enabled the band to make televised appearances, playing on Vincent Moon\'s La Blogotheque in December 2008 and on Saturday Night Live the following January. In 2009, they toured in Europe to favorable reviews; the Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant said their show in Paradiso induced goosebumps. In 2008 and 2009, the band played globally ending the tour in September with a final European leg.\r\n\r\nHelplessness Blues (2009–12)\r\nPecknold said that he would have liked the album to be released in 2009; however, the band\'s touring schedule delayed rehearsals of the new songs until February 2009. These sessions took place in a rented house outside Seattle, but were mostly scrapped, losing the band $60,000 of their own money. Further delays ensued because the drummer, Tillman, was scheduled to play a solo tour in Europe and North America throughout the 2009–10 winter. Pecknold later sent some demos to producer Phil Ek and expressed the hope that the second LP would emerge in late 2010.\r\n\r\nIn December 2009, Pecknold said he wanted the new LP to sound \"less poppy, less upbeat and more groove-based\". He referenced the 12-string guitar sound from Roy Harper\'s folk album Stormcock, saying, \"That will be the primary sonic distancing from the last record.\" He wanted the band to record very quickly, with \"vocal takes in one go, so even if there are fuck-ups, I want them to be on there. I want there to be guitar mistakes. I want there to be not totally flawless vocals. I want to record it and have that kind of cohesive sound. Van Morrison\'s Astral Weeks, to me, is the best-sounding album because it sounds like there were only six hours in the universe for that album to be recorded in. So I want it to have that feeling.\" The band eventually began recording in April 2010 in various locations (including West Hurley, New York) under the label Reciprocal Recording and decided to scrap the earlier idea of a fast recording (though according to the band many of the initial vocals were done in one take). The album features a new six-piece band line up, with the addition of the former Blood Brothers bassist Morgan Henderson on upright bass and woodwind instruments.\r\n\r\nThe album, Helplessness Blues, was released on May 3, 2011 with a cover illustrated by the Seattle artist Toby Liebowitz and painted by Christopher Alderson. The title track was released via free download on January 31, 2011, and the album\'s fourth track, \"Battery Kinzie\", was premiered in the UK on Zane Lowe\'s radio show on March 22, 2011. The Sub Pop record label released a downloadable music video of the track \"Grown Ocean\", with footage of the album\'s recording, on its website in support of the album. A 12\" vinyl double A-side single of \"Helplessness Blues\" and \"Grown Ocean\" was released for Record Store Day on April 16, 2011. On November 1, 2011, Pecknold\'s brother, Sean Pecknold, released the official music video for \"The Shrine / An Argument\".\r\n\r\nHelplessness Blues was nominated as Best Folk Album at the 2012 Grammy Awards, held February 12, 2012.\r\n\r\nDeparture of Tillman and hiatus (2012–2016)\r\nOn January 18, 2012, after the band had finished touring for the album, drummer Tillman announced that he had left the band. He would go on to reinvent himself and record several albums as Father John Misty, notable for his ironic sense of humor in lyrics and media as well as often criticizing both the record industry and society in interviews and on stage.\r\n\r\nIn October 2020, Pecknold reflected on Tillman\'s departure during a Reddit AMA: \"[Josh] \"quit\" the band after recording drums for Helplessness, got into narcotics and made his first Father John Misty album while I was making Helplessness in Seattle. Then Sub Pop offered to put out his album, but only if he delayed it for a year or so and toured Helplessness with us. Which we all weakly agreed to going through with, but it quickly became obvious he\'d rather have just been doing that project instead, and I would have rathered that as well. So that tour I had to endure being around a lot of substance abuse, sabotaged shows, just general ill treatment, shit-talking, all while paying him for songs he didn\'t have anything to do with. It sucked!\"\r\n\r\nOn June 15, 2013, an image of a home recording set-up–including a laptop computer, microphone and guitar–was posted on the Fleet Foxes Facebook page with the caption \"Step one\". On June 16, 2013, an image of a broken mandolin with the caption \"Step two\" was posted. These images were later deleted, but led to speculation that the group was working on a new project, possibly a third studio album. On April 23, 2014, Robin Pecknold posted to the band\'s Facebook page that he had moved to New York to get his undergraduate degree at the Columbia University School of General Studies, a liberal arts college of Columbia University in New York City.\r\n\r\nCrack-Up (2016–2018)\r\nOn May 18, 2016, while answering fan questions on his Instagram account, Pecknold confirmed that Fleet Foxes were working on new material with drummer and frequent collaborator Neal Morgan, best known for his work with Joanna Newsom and Bill Callahan. Describing Morgan as a \"full Fox\", Pecknold also admitted he \"had to up my songwriting game for homeboy.\" However, when Pecknold posted a photo of the band minus Morgan on Instagram, he clarified that Morgan was one of three drummers involved in the new album, and that for the time being Fleet Foxes would consist of Pecknold, Skjelset, Wescott, Wargo, and Henderson as a \"five-piece \'core band\'\", but they would still use a drummer for live performances and additional musicians for certain shows. Pecknold also said that the new material would be \"a different vibe\" compared to Fleet Foxes\' previous output. On November 14, 2016, the band confirmed (via their Facebook account) that their new album was nearly complete.\r\n\r\nOn December 25, 2016, Pecknold posted a photo on his Instagram account which showed four albums in the Fleet Foxes\' queue in his iTunes library: the first studio album Fleet Foxes; the Sun Giant EP; the second studio album Helplessness Blues; and an unknown third album entitled Ylajali. This led to speculation that the band\'s third album would: 1) be named after a character from Knut Hamsun\'s novel Hunger; 2) contain a photo from Japanese photographer Hiroshi Hamaya as the cover art; and 3) be released through Nonesuch Records, since the label\'s logo can be seen on the album cover.\r\n\r\nIn an email newsletter on January 1, 2017, production company Mason Jar Music confirmed that Fleet Foxes was working on a new album, since they contributed to the production. The album was called Crack-Up, after an F. Scott Fitzgerald essay of the same name. The album is a concept album and was recorded at Electric Lady Studios and Sear Sound in New York City.\r\n\r\nOn March 7, 2017, Fleet Foxes announced their third studio album, Crack-Up, released on June 16, 2017 via Nonesuch Records, a new label for the band. The lead single, \"Third of May / Ōdaigahara\", was released the same day. On April 4, 2017, the band posted the album trailer for the new album on YouTube. The trailer briefly presents various songs from the album and shows some images while they were recording them. The video was made by Sean Pecknold, Robin\'s brother.\r\n\r\nOn May 15, 2017, Fleet Foxes made their live return at the Wilma Theatre in Missoula, in which they performed nine songs from Crack-Up along with a selection of older material and a cover of \"In the Morning\" by Bee Gees. The band\'s current live line-up includes Matt Barrick of The Walkmen, who is also the most heavily featured of the three guest drummers who contributed to Crack-Up. Barrick has continued to play with the band, but has not become an official member. The new album also included the sounds of a brass quartet called The Westerlies.\r\n\r\nOn October 10, 2017, the band announced the release of a new EP, entitled The Electric Lady Session, for Black Friday Record Store Day 2017. The EP was released on November 24 of that year, and is a collection of live performances of four songs from Crack-Up, originally recorded for their session at Fordham University’s radio station WFUV. For Record Store Day 2018, the band released another EP, entitled \"Crack Up (Choral Version)\"/\"In The Morning (Live in Switzerland)\", in collaboration with the Icelandic female choir, Graduale Nobili.\r\n\r\nShore (2019–present)\r\nOn December 31, 2018, Pecknold teased several new demos online for an upcoming new album. The album was announced in September 2020; titled Shore, it was released on September 22. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Fleet+Foxes\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The name of the band references the Dutch painter Vincent Van Gogh who allegedly cut off his own ear. It was formed in Spain in 1996, when guitarist Pablo Benegas, bassist Álvaro Fuentes, keyboardist Xabi San Martín and drummer Haritz Garde met at university.\r\n\r\nSan Martin was the vocalist until Amaia Montero joined the band by request from Benegas, just after he met her at a dinner party. Much later, the band played at El Concurso de Pop/Rock de San Sebastián, at which they were discovered and later signed by Sony Music.\r\n\r\nTheir first album, Dile al Sol (Tell The Sun), debuted in 1998; it went to the top of the Spanish music charts, and won the Premio Ondas to The very best Album of the Year. After numerous tours, the group released two more albums, El Viaje de Copperpot (Copperpot\'s Journey) and Lo que te Conté Mientras te Hacias la Dormida (What I Told You While You Pretended To Be Asleep) as well as two DVDs: La Oreja De Van Gogh with material from their first two records, and a live performance called Lo que te Conté Mientras te Hacias la Dormida Gira 2003\'.\r\n\r\nTheir songs are written (both lyrics and music) mostly by Xabi San Martín and Amaia Montero in collaboration with Pablo Benegas, and the themes are usually love, friendship, or whatever comes up in a relationship between two people.\r\n\r\nTheir fourth album, Guapa, was released April 25th 2006. At the end of 2006, the re-edition of this album, called Más Guapa was released. It was met with wide critical success.\r\n\r\nSince their debut, they have sold more than 6 million copies worldwide of their four albums. In November 2007, lead singer Amaia Montero announced that she would be leaving the group to begin a solo career. Her replacement, Leire Martínez, was announced in July 2008, along with the band\'s first single El Último Vals from their album titled A las cinco en el Astoria which was released on September 2, 2008.

The group consists of Bono (lead vocals and rhythm guitar), the Edge (lead guitar, keyboards, and backing vocals), Adam Clayton (bass guitar), and Larry Mullen Jr. (drums and percussion). Initially rooted in post-punk, U2\'s musical style evolved throughout their career, yet has maintained an anthemic sound built on Bono\'s expressive vocals and the Edge\'s effects-based guitar textures. Their lyrics, often embellished with spiritual imagery, focus on personal and sociopolitical themes. Popular for their live performances, the group has staged several ambitious and elaborate tours over their career.\r\n\r\nThe band formed at Mount Temple Comprehensive School in 1976 when the members were teenagers with limited musical proficiency. Within four years, they signed with Island Records and released their debut album, Boy (1980). Subsequent work such as their first UK number-one album, War (1983), and the singles \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\" and \"Pride (In the Name of Love)\" helped establish U2\'s reputation as a politically and socially conscious group. By the mid-1980s, they had become renowned globally for their live act, highlighted by their performance at Live Aid in 1985. The group\'s fifth album, The Joshua Tree (1987), made them international superstars and was their greatest critical and commercial success. Topping music charts around the world, it produced two number-one singles in the US, \"With or Without You\" and \"I Still Haven\'t Found What I\'m Looking For\".\r\n\r\nFacing creative stagnation and a backlash following their documentary/double album, Rattle and Hum (1988), U2 reinvented themselves in the 1990s through a new musical direction and public image. Beginning with their acclaimed seventh album, Achtung Baby (1991), and the multimedia-intensive Zoo TV Tour, the band integrated influences from alternative rock, electronic dance music, and industrial music into their sound, and embraced a more ironic, flippant image. This experimentation continued through their ninth album, Pop (1997), and the PopMart Tour, which were mixed successes. U2 regained critical and commercial favour with the records All That You Can\'t Leave Behind (2000) and How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb (2004), which established a more conventional, mainstream sound for the group. Their U2 360° Tour of 2009–2011 is the highest-attended and highest-grossing concert tour in history. The group\'s thirteenth album, Songs of Innocence (2014), was released at no cost through the iTunes Store, but received criticism for its automatic placement in users\' music libraries.\r\n\r\nU2 has released 14 studio albums and is one of the world\'s best-selling music artists in history, having sold more than 170 million records worldwide. They have won 22 Grammy Awards, more than any other band, and in 2005, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in their first year of eligibility. Rolling Stone ranked U2 at number 22 on its list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\". Throughout their career, as a band and as individuals, they have campaigned for human rights and philanthropic causes, including Amnesty International, Jubilee 2000, the ONE/DATA campaigns, Product Red, War Child, and Music Rising.\r\n\r\nFoundation: The band originally formed in 1976 when Larry Mullen posted a bulletin in his school asking for musicians to form a rock band. The band then consisted of the four current members plus three additional guitarists, including The Edge’s brother Dick Evans (later a member of Virgin Prunes), Ivan McCormick and Peter Martin. According to legend, Bono originally auditioned as a guitarist but couldn’t play. He auditioned as lead vocals, but really couldn’t sing. He was, however, incredibly enthusiastic about the band, extremely charismatic, a great writer, and was strangely able to reach the audience when the band played, something he is known for still today. Bono will reach out into the crowd and dance or mess with someone in the crowd at every concert. He was kept as a member. The extra guitarists would soon leave the band and the group would go through the names “Feedback ” and “The Hype” before finally settling on U2.\r\n\r\nThe 70s & 80s: 1978 was a jumping point year for the band, finally finding their sound / voice. U2 won a talent contest in 1978: £500 and funds to make a record. Paul McGuinness became the band’s manager and U2 released an EP called Three and the single Another Day, the following year. U2 went on to release their first album, Boy and then more critically acclaimed albums incl.: October, War, Under A Blood Red Sky, and The Unforgettable Fire (featuring the song PlayMLK dedicated to Martin Luther King Jr). Seen by many as a political band with more charisma than others, they were called “a different kind” of band. After a short break U2 returned with The Joshua Tree & the USA music inspired Rattle And Hum (also a movie of the same name, based on the tour).\r\n\r\nThe 90s: Promising ”to dream it all up again”, they added industrial and dance styles to their music. Trying to drop a goody two shoes image, they went to Berlin (Germany), supposedly to develop new self-expressions. From there they started to make fun of themselves and had a good time of it in albums like Achtung Baby (meaning ”watch out, baby”, artwork feat. make-up artist Nassim Khalifa) & Zooropa. Bono took on many stage personae such as “The Fly”, “Mirrorball Man” and “Mr. MacPhisto” for the gigantic ZOO TV Tour. Later they continued to make fun of Pop culture and all its extremes with the album Pop and consequent PopMart tour which was announced to be launched at a Kmart store and included a giant golden arch across the stage.\r\n\r\nThe 00s: At the end of the 90’s into 00’s U2 became less image and more reality. With the death of Bono’s good friend Michael Hutchence, the lead singer of INXS, Bono wrote more songs from the heart surrounding ideas like life and death, children, hope, and the real world past all the pop culture and TV. Some say they’ve returned to a more band-centric sound with albums like All That You Can’t Leave Behind which features a song, Kite, dedicated to Bono’s father who passed away shortly after the album’s conception and 2004’s How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb.\r\n\r\nThe 10s: U2 went on the  U2 360° Tour in 2009 and 2010. This tour set records for the highest-grossing concert tour. The band worked with producer Danger Mouse for their thirteenth album Songs of Innocence, which was released on 9 September 2014 for free to all Apple iCloud users. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/U2\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Mastodon has released seven studio albums, as well as a number of other releases. The band\'s 2002 debut album, Remission, garnered significant critical acclaim for its unique sound. Mastodon\'s second full-length release, Leviathan, is a concept album based on the novel Moby-Dick by Herman Melville. Three magazines awarded the record Album of the Year in 2004: Revolver, Kerrang! and Terrorizer.\r\n\r\nThe song \"Colony of Birchmen\" from the band\'s third album (released in 2006), Blood Mountain, was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 2007. Blood Mountain was followed in 2009 by Crack the Skye, and in 2011 by The Hunter, which debuted at No. 10 on the Billboard 200 chart and achieved major commercial success in the United States. The Hunter features the song \"Curl of the Burl\", which was nominated for a Grammy for Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance in 2012. Mastodon\'s 2014 album, Once More \'Round the Sun, peaked at No. 6 on the Billboard 200 chart and features the band\'s third Grammy-nominated song, \"High Road\". The band\'s seventh album, Emperor of Sand, was released on March 31, 2017, and features the band\'s most commercially successful song to date, \"Show Yourself\", which peaked at No. 4 on the US Billboard Mainstream Rock Songs chart in June 2017. The followup single, \"Steambreather\", peaked at number 18 on the same chart in October 2017. The album\'s opening track, \"Sultan\'s Curse\", earned the band their first Grammy award. Emperor of Sand was the band\'s first album to receive a Grammy nomination; it was nominated for Best Rock Album.\r\n\r\nMastodon was formed on January 13, 2000, after drummer Brann Dailor and guitarist Bill Kelliher moved to Atlanta from Victor, New York, and met bassist/singer Troy Sanders and guitarist/singer Brent Hinds at a High on Fire show. They discovered they had a mutual appreciation of sludge metal bands Melvins and Neurosis, heavy metal legends Iron Maiden, and 1970s hard rockers Thin Lizzy, and shortly thereafter formed Mastodon. In an interview in 2009, Kelliher revealed that the first time Hinds attended a practice with the band, he \"showed up so wasted he couldn\'t play\".\r\n\r\nThe band recorded a demo in 2000, which featured Eric Saner on vocals. Saner left the band for personal reasons after just a couple of months. After recording a four-song demo and a 7-inch picture disc through Reptilian Records, Mastodon landed a record deal with Relapse Records in 2001. Mastodon released the EP Lifesblood in 2001, and its first full-length album, Remission, in 2002, with the singles \"March of the Fire Ants\" and \"Crusher/Destroyer\" (which was also featured on Tony Hawk\'s Underground). On each of Mastodon\'s first three full-length albums, the last track was an instrumental composition with a title that related to the Elephant Man.\r\n\r\nArtist Paul Romano was responsible for all of the band\'s album art and backdrops up to 2011. The artwork for the band\'s fifth studio album The Hunter was made by AJ Fosik, a woodcarver who was also responsible for the backdrop the band used live at the time. Oakland-based artist Skinner, who, in his own words, specializes in \"psychedelic nightmare paintings\", has taken the reins on Once More \'Round the Sun. \"It\'s going to be a work of art for sure.

Formed in 1965, the group defined the San Francisco Sound and was the first from the Bay Area to achieve international commercial success. They were headliners at the three most famous American rock festivals of the 1960s—Monterey (1967), Woodstock (1969) and Altamont (1969)—and the first Isle of Wight Festival (1968) in England. Their 1967 break-out album Surrealistic Pillow ranks on the short list of the most significant recordings of the \"Summer of Love\". Two songs from that album, \"Somebody to Love\" and \"White Rabbit\", are among Rolling Stone\'s \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"classic\" lineup of Jefferson Airplane, from October 1966 to February 1970, was Marty Balin (vocals), Paul Kantner (guitar, vocals), Grace Slick (vocals), Jorma Kaukonen (lead guitar, vocals), Jack Casady (bass), and Spencer Dryden (drums). Marty Balin left the band in 1971. After 1972, Jefferson Airplane effectively split into two groups. Kaukonen and Casady moved on full time to their own band, Hot Tuna. Slick, Kantner, and the remaining members of Jefferson Airplane recruited new members and regrouped as Jefferson Starship in 1974, with Marty Balin eventually joining them. Jefferson Airplane was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996 and was presented with the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2016. \r\n\r\nSpencer Dryden died on January 11, 2005.\r\n\r\nBoth Signe Anderson and Paul Kantner died on January 28, 2016.\r\n\r\nMarty Balin died on September 27, 2018 <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Jefferson+Airplane\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

They consist of lead vocalist and guitarist Conor Mason, guitarist Joe Langridge-Brown, guitarist and keyboardist Dominic Craik, bassist Philip Blake, and drummer James Price. Their style of music has been compared to the likes of Foals, The Neighbourhood, and Civil Twilight, and they have been played on alternative and active rock radio.\r\n\r\nNothing But Thieves’ origins lie in schoolmates Conor, Joe and Dave’s efforts in a variety of bands in their hometown of Southend, Essex. They gained valuable experience on the local live circuit, even if they weren’t going to change the world.  Then Dom joined their school in the sixth form and everything went up a notch. A classically trained guitarist from the age of six, Dom brought a musicality and learning to the table which made everyone sit up and take notice.  Not that this puts him on a pedestal with his bandmates. They all agree that it’s the mix of his formal training with Joe’s self-taught chops which lies at the heart of the Nothing But Thieves sound. \r\n\r\nThey released their debut ep, \"Graveyard Whistling\" on July 18, 2014. The band\'s single \"Itch\" picked up Hottest Record and Track Of The Day accolades on Radio 1 and also made it onto the Radio 1 playlist, as well as being added in regular rotation of Sirius XM new hard-rock channel Octane. The same year they signed to RCA Records.\r\n\r\nThey released their self-titled debut album on October 16, 2015. Frontman Conor Mason said in an interview about the album: Since this record was our first album we especially wanted to make each song stand out in the best way possible. I guess there are tones, lyrics and themes that tie in throughout the album; however, we generally wanted each song to have its own space and world. Overall, I think we achieved the variety we were after and it’s nice that our fans feel the same way too.\r\n\r\nThey released their sophomore album, called \"Broken Machine\", on September 8, 2017. The concept for the album came alive soon after the band had written and demoed “Broken Machine,” the 4th track, which became the centerpiece of the album. Lead singer Conor Mason describes it as a metaphor for systems that seem perfect on the surface but cracked underneath, whether that’s mental health, love, religion, or even politics. The singles leading up to the album’s release are “Amsterdam,” released on May 2, 2017, “Sorry” released on August 14, 2017, “Broken Machine” released on August 21, 2017, “I’m Not Made By Design” released on August 26, 2017, and “Particles” released on January 11, 2018.\r\n\r\nThey released a new ep, titled \"What Did You Think When You Made Me This Way?\" on October 19, 2018. The lead single of the ep, \"Forever & Ever More\", was supported by a music video. On October 23, 2020, the band released Moral Panic. Which then followed with a tour in 2021 with Yonaka and Airways.\r\n\r\nThe band released three singles in 2023, \"Welcome to the DCC\" on March 15, \"Overcome\" on May 10 and \"Keeping You Around\" on June 23, before finally releasing their fourth studio album, \"Dead Club City\" on June 30, 2023, which peaked number 1 in the U.K Official Album Charts.

With the line-up comprising John Lennon, Paul McCartney,  George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they are regarded as the most popular and influential band of all time. The group was integral to the development of 1960s counterculture and popular music\'s recognition as an art form. Rooted in skiffle, beat and 1950s rock and roll, their sound incorporated elements of classical music and traditional pop in innovative ways; the band later explored music styles ranging from ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock. As pioneers in recording, songwriting and artistic presentation, the group revolutionized many aspects of the music industry and were often publicized as leaders of the era\'s youth and socio-cultural movements. \r\n\r\nLed by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, the Beatles built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over three years from 1960, initially with Stuart Sutcliffe playing bass. The core trio of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, together since 1958, went through a succession of drummers, eventually settling with Pete Best in 1960, who played with them for two years before being replaced with then Rory Storm & The Hurricanes drummer Ringo Starr in 1962. Manager Brian Epstein molded them into a professional act and producer George Martin guided and developed their recordings, greatly expanding their domestic success after their first hit, \"Love Me Do\", in late 1962. As their popularity grew into the intense fan frenzy dubbed \"Beatlemania\", the band acquired the nickname \"the Fab Four\", with Epstein, Martin and other members of the band\'s entourage sometimes given the informal title of \"fifth Beatle\".\r\n\r\nBy early 1964, the Beatles were international stars, leading the \"British Invasion\" of the United States pop market and breaking numerous sales records. They soon made their film debut with A Hard Day\'s Night (1964). From 1965 onwards, they produced increasingly innovative recordings, including the albums Rubber Soul (1965), Revolver (1966) and Sgt. Pepper\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967), and enjoyed further commercial success with The Beatles (also known as \"the White Album\", 1968) and Abbey Road (1969). In 1968, they founded Apple Corps, a multi-armed multimedia corporation that continues to oversee projects related to the band\'s legacy. After the group\'s break-up in 1970, all four members enjoyed success as solo artists. Lennon was shot and killed in December 1980, and Harrison died of lung cancer in November 2001. McCartney and Starr remain musically active.\r\n\r\nThe Beatles are the best-selling music act of all time, with estimated sales of 600 million units worldwide. They hold the record for most number-one albums on the UK Albums Chart, most number-one hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and most singles sold in the UK. The group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988, and all four main members were inducted individually between 1994 and 2015. In 2008, the group topped Billboard\'s list of the all-time most successful artists on the Billboard Hot 100. The band received seven Grammy Awards, four Brit Awards, an Academy Award (for Best Original Song Score for the 1970 film Let It Be) and fifteen Ivor Novello Awards. Time magazine named them among the 20th century\'s 100 most important people.\r\n\r\nFormer Rolling Stone associate editor Robert Greenfield compared the Beatles to Picasso, as \"artists who broke through the constraints of their time period to come up with something that was unique and original \"... In the form of popular music, no one will ever be more revolutionary, more creative and more distinctive ...\" The British poet Philip Larkin described their work as \"an enchanting and intoxicating hybrid of African-American rock-and-roll with their own adolescent romanticism\", and \"the first advance in popular music since the War\".\r\n\r\nThey not only sparked the British Invasion of the US, they became a globally influential phenomenon as well. From the 1920s, the US had dominated popular entertainment culture throughout much of the world, via Hollywood films, jazz, the music of Broadway and Tin Pan Alley and, later, the rock and roll that first emerged in Memphis, Tennessee. The Beatles are regarded as British cultural icons, with young adults from abroad naming the band among a group of people that they most associated with UK culture.\r\n\r\nTheir musical innovations and commercial success inspired musicians worldwide. Many artists have acknowledged the Beatles\' influence and enjoyed chart success with covers of their songs. On radio, their arrival marked the beginning of a new era; in 1968 the programme director of New York\'s WABC radio station forbade his DJs from playing any \"pre-Beatles\" music, marking the defining line of what would be considered oldies on American radio. They helped to redefine the album as something more than just a few hits padded out with \"filler\", and they were primary innovators of the modern music video. The Shea Stadium show with which they opened their 1965 North American tour attracted an estimated 55,600 people, then the largest audience in concert history; Spitz describes the event as a \"major breakthrough ... a giant step toward reshaping the concert business\". Emulation of their clothing and especially their hairstyles, which became a mark of rebellion, had a global impact on fashion.\r\n\r\nAccording to Gould, the Beatles changed the way people listened to popular music and experienced its role in their lives. From what began as the Beatlemania fad, the group\'s popularity grew into what was seen as an embodiment of socio-cultural movements of the decade. As icons of the 1960s counterculture, Gould continues, they became a catalyst for bohemianism and activism in various social and political arenas, fuelling movements such as women\'s liberation, gay liberation and environmentalism. According to Peter Lavezzoli, after the \"more popular than Jesus\" controversy in 1966, the Beatles felt considerable pressure to say the right things and \"began a concerted effort to spread a message of wisdom and higher consciousness\".\r\n\r\n\r\nOther commentators such as Mikal Gilmore and Todd Leopold have traced the inception of their socio-cultural impact earlier, interpreting even the Beatlemania period, particularly on their first visit to the US, as a key moment in the development of generational awareness. Referring to their appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show Leopold states: \"In many ways, the Sullivan appearance marked the beginning of a cultural revolution ... The Beatles were like aliens dropped into the United States of 1964.\r\n\r\nIn 1965, Queen Elizabeth II appointed Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Starr Members of the Order of the British Empire (MBE). The Beatles won the 1971 Academy Award for Best Original Song Score for the film Let It Be (1970). The recipients of seven Grammy Awards and fifteen Ivor Novello Awards, the Beatles have six Diamond albums, as well as 20 Multi-Platinum albums, 16 Platinum albums and six Gold albums in the US. In the UK, the Beatles have four Multi-Platinum albums, four Platinum albums, eight Gold albums and one Silver album. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988.\r\n\r\nThe best-selling band in history, the Beatles have sold more than 800 million physical and digital albums as of 2013. They have had more number-one albums on the UK charts, fifteen, and sold more singles in the UK, 21.9 million, than any other act. In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked the Beatles as the most significant and influential rock music artists of the last 50 years. They ranked number one on Billboard magazine\'s list of the all-time most successful Hot 100 artists, released in 2008 to celebrate the US singles chart\'s 50th anniversary. As of 2017, they hold the record for most number-one hits on the Billboard Hot 100, with twenty. The Recording Industry Association of America certifies that the Beatles have sold 178 million units in the US, more than any other artist. They were collectively included in Time magazine\'s compilation of the 20th century\'s 100 most influential people. In 2014, they received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.\r\n\r\nThere are two holidays celebrated for the Beatles: Global Beatles Day on 25 June each year. On that date in 1967, the band performed \"All You Need Is Love\" on television. In 2001, UNESCO created World Beatles Day on 16 January each year. This date has direct relation to the opening of The Cavern Club in 1957.\r\n\r\nFive asteroids, 4147 Lennon, 4148 McCartney, 4149 Harrison, 4150 Starr and 8749 Beatles are named after the Beatles. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

While on tour on the west coast, their van was pulled over and eventually raided and thieved by corrupt Mexican cops who took all the money the band had, except for the few dollars Rick stashed in his boot. Disoriented and shaken from the experience, the band headed to the first bar they could find to calm themselves down. It was the Adelita Bar. After spending some time in there, the guys realized that it wasn\'t just a bar, it was a brothel. Rick ended up talking to one of the girls who worked there and asked her how she could live like she was day in and day out. She explained that it was the only way she knew to support  her family in need. Talking to her helped change Rick\'s outlook on life and people, and thus the \'way\' she lived became the inspiration for the name. \r\n\r\nMembers\r\n\r\n    * Rick De Jesus - Lead Vocals\r\n    * Robert Zakaryans- Lead Guitar (2011-Present)\r\n    * Tre Stafford - Drums\r\n    * Keith Wallen- Vocals, Guitar\r\n    * Derek Johnston- Bass\r\n\r\nRock band influenced by STP, Soundgarden, Foo Fighters, Audioslave, Breaking Benjamin, Three Days Grace <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Adelitas+Way\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Ballyhoo (without the exclamation mark!) is a South African group who had a huge hit in 1980 in their homeland with their single \'Man On The Moon\'. This South African group is still going strong. The other group with the same name (but with the exclamation mark!) is from Maryland, USA, a modern rock/reggae party band, active since 2006.\r\n\r\nBALLYHOO! is undeniably turning the world of music upside down and sideways as they blur the lines between rock, reggae, punk and pop to craft their own hybrid of music that can’t be held down to one definitive genre.  This signature sound of theirs is one they have been perfecting since their high school days in Aberdeen, Maryland - the sweet melodic voice of lead singer and guitarist Howi Spangler; the hard hitting beats set forth by brother and drummer Donald “Big D” Spangler; the skillfully added funk of bassist JR Gregory and Scott Vandrey (aka DJ Blaze) rounds it out on the turntables and keys.\r\n\r\nBALLYHOO!’s unique sound, hardcore devotion to the road and to their fans, partnered with their irresistible “life of the party” approach have pitched them into the position of America’s favorite feel good party band.  They didn’t get here by accident; rather, they had been single-handedly growing their empire through unparalleled hard work and dedication until Jan 2011, when they got a well-deserved nod from LAW Records and were signed to the Hawaii-based independent record label.  Yesod Williams of the dub rock music mega-sensation PEPPER and owner of LAW Records says of his newest addition, “Having BALLYHOO! join the LAW Records family is a perfect fit.  They are an incredibly talented band with a really catchy style”.  Now, with the backing of LAW, 2011 promises to be a paramount year on BALLYHOO!’s trajectory destined for greatness!\r\n\r\nBALLYHOO! has toured the country with some of the biggest and most respected names in the reggae rock genre – 311, Authority Zero, Pepper, The Supervillains. “It’s always intimidating when playing for another band’s crowd, you never know how they’re gonna react,” explains front man Howi, “but then you see that they’re enjoying it and the worry goes away.  You’re free to rock at that point!”.  \r\n\r\nBALLYHOO! will start their tour of the southeast with fellow label mates Iration in February 2011.  Their rigorous, nonstop nationwide touring schedule has certainly been the catalyst for the exponential growth in their fan base.  BALLYHOO! fans are some of the most loyal and enthusiastic fans out there and their love for the band runs deep.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, BALLYHOO! released Do It For The Money! which “opened a lot of doors for us and spread like wildfire in the underground” says Howi.   Their follow up album, Cheers!, was released in May of 2009 and was an opportunity to work with 311’s Scotch Ralston as the producer.  In addition, BALLYHOO!’s stellar rendition of “40 Oz. To Freedom” is featured on the compilation album, Forever Free: A Tribute to Sublime, and helped stimulate a surge in their popularity. Fans can also hear their songs on the Rock Band Network and in feature films.\r\n\r\nBALLYHOO! currently has a single out on iTunes (“The Front Porch”) and when they aren’t on the road, they are in the studio, finishing their new album, which is slated for release on LAW Records in the summer of 2011.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ballyhoorocks.com\r\nhttp://www.facebook.com/Ballyhoo <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Ballyhoo%21\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

His hometown friend and future poptropicaslutz! bandmate Nick Crawford was one semester into his first semester of community college with plans to transfer to Parsons. But as March 2020 rolled around and a global pandemic upset their respective plans, Crawford and Cicilia decided to take advantage of the moment and form poptropicaslutz! — a genre-surfing hyperpunk project brimming with nonstop hooks and pop-fueled energy.\r\n\r\nNow 20 and 21, Cicilia and Crawford are genuinely living out their dream: They’re newly signed to punk/alternative incubator Epitaph Records and actively working on the much-anticipated follow-up to their 2022 just in case the world ends DELUXE EP, which is produced in part by the band’s close collaborator Aldrch (Midwxst, Aldn, Contradash) and mixed by Brian Moncarz (Alice Cooper, Circa Survive) and Matt Mallpass (Blink 182, Trippie Redd). As songwriters, Cicilia and Crawford both draw considerable inspiration from a variety of genres and decades, imbuing their glitched-out, auto-tuned melodies with elements of Fall Out Boy, Hellogoodbye, Juice WRLD, Kelly Clarkson, the Black Eyed Peas, and ‘10s SoundCloud rap.\r\n\r\n“When I’m sitting down to write a song, I\'ll try to get inspiration from a random thing, or however I\'m feeling about a specific person,” Crawford says of his process. “If we\'re writing together, I try to take something in like the room to write about. Like our new song ‘bittersweet teeth — we were in the studio with Nick Long and Andy Seltzer, and they had a photo album in the studio. Looking through it, I was like, let\'s make a song about capturing a moment.” Crawford connects this process to another upcoming song, “Where The Wind Blows,” which he and Cicilia built out from the word “PRISM” being written out on the studio’s wall.\r\n\r\nThe last couple of pandemic years provided ample material for poptropicaslutz! to pour into their debut, just in case the world ends. “I feel like if COVID didn\'t happen, I would never have wanted that to be the name of our debut EP,” laughs Crawford. “But when things started getting bad, it was like one new, terrible thing every few days. Whether it was COVID or the BLM riots. I was like, ‘wow, the world\'s really ended. It’s the end of the world.’ EP opener “WW3” (featuring RIZ LA VIE & GRANDMA) captures this apocalyptic feeling; over banging percussion and crunchy guitars, the two trade tongue-in-cheek lyrics about IRL catastrophes seen through a virtual lens (“One day I\'ll die, and you\'ll just think I\'m offline”).\r\n\r\nDespite the generation-defining global events that shaped them, poptropicaslutz! also pour classic young-adult angst into their songwriting. The glitch-pop/dance-punk single “TEEN POP SENSATION,” for example, goes hard with live-for-now energy. Layering auto-tuned vocals reminiscent of Panic! At The Disco, the band pushes listeners to live for the present moment, even in the face of naysayers and outside chaos: “Then you dance, dance, hoping it\'ll mask the pain/ Baby, fuck it, do a handstand, go insane/ Like there\'s nobody watching/ They\'re all just critics anyway, so act out of pocket.”\r\n\r\nIt’s vital advice for anyone — regardless of age. If poptropicaslutz! themselves hadn’t decided to say “fuck it” and form a band, none of the success they’ve seen — between the sold-out shows, Spotify New Music Friday placements, and glowing write-ups in Ones To Watch — would be happening. But, in addition to having uncanny ears for melody, Cicilia and Crawford are strategic and focused on making the most of this moment. “If I’d gone to Cornell, I probably wouldn\'t be making music,” Cicilia says. “I was always the goody two shoes smart kid. I didn’t want to let anyone down. But the pandemic made me turn around and say: ‘Whatever. This is a once-in-a-lifetime thing.” <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/poptropicaslutz%21\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The band\'s founding members were bassist Garry Gary Beers, main composer and keyboardist Andrew Farriss, drummer Jon Farriss, guitarist Tim Farriss, lead singer and main lyricist Michael Hutchence, and guitarist and saxophonist Kirk Pengilly. For 20 years, INXS was fronted by Hutchence, whose magnetic stage presence made him the focal point of the band. Initially known for their new wave/pop style, the band later developed a harder pub rock style that included funk and dance elements.\r\n\r\nIn 1984, INXS had their first number-one hit in Australia with \"Original Sin\". The band would later achieve international success in the mid-to-late 1980s and early 1990s with the hit albums Listen Like Thieves, Kick, and X, as well as the singles \"What You Need\", \"Need You Tonight\" (the band\'s number-one single in the United States), \"Devil Inside\", \"Never Tear Us Apart\", \"Suicide Blonde\" and \"New Sensation\".\r\n\r\nAfter Hutchence\'s death on 22 November 1997, INXS made appearances with several guest singers, and toured and recorded with Jon Stevens as lead singer, beginning in 2000. In 2005, members of INXS participated in Rock Star: INXS, a reality television series that culminated in the selection of Canadian J.D. Fortune as their new lead singer. Irish singer-songwriter Ciaran Gribbin replaced Fortune as lead singer in 2011. During a concert on 11 November 2012, INXS stated that the performance would be their last, although they did not announce the band\'s permanent retirement.\r\n\r\nINXS won six Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) awards, including three for \"Best Group\" in 1987, 1989 and 1992; the band was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame in 2001. INXS has sold over 70 million albums worldwide, making them one of Australia\'s highest selling music acts of all time.\r\n\r\nEarly years\r\nThe origins of the band began with Andrew Farriss convincing his fellow Davidson High School classmate, Michael Hutchence, to join his band, Doctor Dolphin. The band contained two further classmates, Kent Kerny and Neil Sanders, as well as Garry Beers and Geoff Kennely, both from a nearby high school, Forest High School. In 1977, Tim Farriss, Andrew\'s older brother, invited Andrew, Hutchence and Beers to join him and his schoolmate Kirk Pengilly. Tim and Pengilly had been playing together since 1971 as either an acoustic duo, Kirk and Tim, or as a four-piece band called Guinness (named after their bass player\'s dog). Together with younger brother Jon Farriss they formed \"The Farriss Brothers\", who consisted of Garry Beers on bass guitar, Andrew Farriss on keyboards, Jon Farriss on drums, Tim Farriss on lead guitar, Michael Hutchence on lead vocals and Kirk Pengilly on guitar and saxophone. The band made their debut on 16 August 1977 at Whale Beach, 40 km (25 mi) north of Sydney.\r\n\r\nThe parents of the Farriss boys relocated to Perth, Western Australia in 1978, taking Jon to continue his schooling and, as soon as Hutchence and Andrew finished school, the rest of the band followed. They briefly performed as The Vegetables, singing \"We Are the Vegetables\", before returning to Sydney ten months later, where they recorded a set of demos. At a chance meeting in the car park of the Narrabeen Antler, a pub in Narrabeen on the Northern Beaches of Sydney, New South Wales, Tim was approached by Gary Morris, the manager of Midnight Oil.\r\n\r\nThe band began to regularly support Midnight Oil and other local bands. Morris advised that a member of the Oils crew had come up with a new name and suggested they change it to INXS. The name INXS was inspired by English band XTC and Australian jam makers IXL. Pengilly later explained that Morris was interested in turning the group into a Christian band, which the band briefly considered before rejecting the idea.\r\n\r\nThe band\'s first performance as INXS was on 1 September 1979 at the Ocean Beach Hotel in Umina on the Central Coast of New South Wales and by the end of 1979, after passing on the Christian band image, they hired Chris \"CM\" Murphy as their manager and continued taking on the Oz pub circuit. Murphy was an adept business manager and negotiator and by early 1980 the band had signed a five-album record deal with a Sydney independent label, Deluxe Records, run by Michael Browning, a former manager of AC/DC.\r\n\r\n1980s\r\n\r\nFrom \"Simple Simon\" to Shabooh Shoobah\r\nINXS released their first single, \"Simple Simon\"/\"We Are the Vegetables\", in Australia and France in May 1980. The single had its debut TV performance on Simon Townsend\'s Wonder World. Their self-titled debut album, INXS, was recorded at Trafalgar Studios in Annandale, Sydney, it was co-produced by the band and Duncan McGuire (ex-Ayers Rock), with all songs attributed to the entire band, at the insistence of Murphy. Deluxe gave them a budget of $10,000 to record the album, so to keep within the budget they had to record from midnight to dawn, usually after doing one or more performances earlier that night. The album was released in October 1980. It featured \"Just Keep Walking\" which was their first Australian Top 40 single, with the album peaking in the Top 30 of the Kent Music Report for Australian albums. The album eventually went gold (selling over 35,000 units) but it took a number of years to do so.\r\n\r\nThese early records demonstrated their new wave/ska/pop style, and were followed by near constant touring with almost 300 shows during 1981 as the band developed their status as a live act. In 1981, they signed Gary Grant as their tour manager, who then became co-manager a year later. Between touring commitments, the band released their third single in May 1981, \"The Loved One\", which was a cover of a 1966 song by Australian group The Loved Ones. The song was recorded at Studios 301 in Sydney, produced by Richard Clapton, and peaked in the Top 20.\r\n\r\nThe success of the single led to Clapton and the band returning to Studios 301 between July and August 1981 to create an album. In October 1981, their second album Underneath the Colours was released and became a hit in Australia peaking at No. 15.\r\n\r\nSoon after recording sessions had finished, band members started work on outside projects. Beers, Jon and Andrew Farriss played on Clapton\'s solo album, The Great Escape. Hutchence recorded \"Speed Kills\", written by Don Walker of Cold Chisel for the soundtrack of the film Freedom directed by Scott Hicks. It was his first solo single and was released by WEA in early 1982. In January, INXS toured New Zealand as support act for Cold Chisel. Band manager, Murphy, became convinced their future no longer lay with Deluxe Records. RCA (who distributed Deluxe) had employed music lover Rockin Rod Woods, who had been promoting Eric Clapton, Split Enz and some of the world\'s biggest acts.\r\n\r\nWoods was passionate about the band and brought key music people along to their gigs. He encouraged RCA to sign them worldwide because Murphy had played him some demos. Deluxe had been unable to attract international interest, and decided to record a new song, \"The One Thing\" at their own expense, with Mark Opitz at Paradise Studios. The song turned out so well that Murphy hired Opitz to produce three more songs. Murphy approached WEA Australia with copies of the song, leading to INXS signing a recording deal in July 1982 with WEA for releases in Australia, South East Asia, Japan and New Zealand, Atco Records (a subsidiary of Atlantic Records) for North America and Polygram for Europe and the UK.\r\n\r\nMurphy and the band were not entirely convinced that Opitz could produce an entire album that would attract international interest, so before recording their third album Pengilly, Hutchence and Andrew Farriss visited the UK and USA, with a view to selecting a suitable producer, only to find that no one they wanted was available and that most people advised them that Opitz\'s work on their single was as good as they could wish for.\r\n\r\nIn mid-1982, they began recording at Rhinoceros Studios, with Opitz. In October 1982, Shabooh Shoobah was released internationally on Atlantic/Atco Records, peaking at No. 52 on the US Billboard 200 and No. 46 on the Hot Pop Albums chart. In Australia it peaked at No. 5 and remained in the albums charts for 94 weeks. The single \"The One Thing\" brought them their first Top 30 hit in United States peaking at No. 30 on 28 May 1983, it was a Top 20 hit in Canada, and peaked at No. 14 in Australia on 23 August 1982. \"One Thing\" was their first video to air on the fledgling MTV and significantly added to the ultimate success of the single.\r\n\r\n13 February 1983, saw INXS play the Stop the Drop Nuclear Disarmament concert to 14,000 at the Myer Music Bowl in Melbourne, alongside Midnight Oil, Colin Hay, Redgum and Goanna. It was simulcast on Australian TV by Channel 10 and Radio 2MMM.\r\n\r\nINXS undertook their first US performance in San Diego in March 1983, to a crowd of 24 patrons. Their first tour was as support for Adam and the Ants, then support for Stray Cats, The Kinks, Hall & Oates followed by The Go-Go\'s. INXS played alongside many of their contemporaries on New Wave Day in May 1983, at the US Festival in Devore, California. It was during this time that Grant, their co-manager, relocated permanently to New York to ensure a continual presence in the northern hemisphere. The band remained on the road in the US for most of the year, including support for Men at Work and by mid-1983 were headlining venues such as The Ritz in New York.\r\n\r\nFrom \"Original Sin\" to Listen Like Thieves\r\nINXS started out as a new wave act, but gradually moved in a more straight-ahead rock-oriented direction through the first half of the 1980s.\r\n\r\nAfter a performance in Toronto, Canada, the band was approached by producer Nile Rodgers; by September 1983, the band had recorded \"Original Sin\" (originally entitled \"Brand New Day\") at New York\'s Power Station Studios. Three tracks from Shabooh Shoobah were featured in the soundtrack for the 1984 film Reckless. The band then travelled to the UK to begin sessions on their fourth album with Nick Launay at the Manor Studios in Oxford.\r\n\r\nThe album The Swing, released in April 1984, received significant attention from around the world, as \"Original Sin\" became the band\'s first No. 1 single in Australia and was popular worldwide with fans and reviewers. During 1984, the single reached no. 1 in Australia (for two weeks in January), Argentina, and France; No. 6 in New Zealand; No. 11 in Canada; No. 23 in Switzerland; No. 31 in the Netherlands; and No. 58 in the U.S. Yet \"Original Sin\" was largely ignored in the U.K., where INXS was described in New Musical Express as a \"depressingly definitive example of excruciating, boring, incredibly unimaginative MTV rock\"; INXS did not have any Top 50 chart success in the United Kingdom until the 1985 album Listen Like Thieves.\r\n\r\nDuring 1984, INXS toured non-stop, performing across Europe, the UK, the US and Australia. By December 1984, The Swing had gone double platinum, making it one of the five biggest domestic albums in the history of Australian music at the time.\r\n\r\nIn March 1985, the band re-entered Sydney\'s Rhinoceros Studios to record their next album, together with producer Chris Thomas (Sex Pistols, Pink Floyd, The Pretenders, Elton John). As the band was finishing the recording sessions, Thomas stated that the album was not good enough and still had no \"killer\" track. Andrew produced a demo tape of a funk song he had been working on called \"Funk Song No. 13\" and evolved it into \"What You Need\".\r\n\r\nWhilst the band was recording, WEA released Dekadance, a limited edition 12\" Vinyl and cassette only EP of INXS remixes from their albums The Swing and Shabooh Shoobah.\r\n\r\nOn 19 May 1985, INXS won seven awards at the 1984 Countdown Music and Video Awards ceremony. They performed \"Burn for You\", dressed in Akubras (hats) and Drizabones (outdoor coats/oilskin jackets). The band performed five songs for the July 1985 Oz for Africa concert, in conjunction with the Live Aid benefit. Two INXS songs, \"What You Need\" and \"Don\'t Change\", were also in the BBC broadcast and are contained on Live Aid\'s four DVD boxed set released in 2004.\r\n\r\nListen Like Thieves was released in October 1985 to critical approval, reaching No. 3 on the Australian charts and No. 11 on the US charts. With the release of Listen Like Thieves, the band developed a rock sound influenced by Led Zeppelin and XTC while remaining true to the band\'s original roots in Aussie pubs. It was also the first album to feature songs written by a combination of band members, with Andrew Farris and Hutchence becoming the primary songwriters in the years to follow. The first U.S. single from the album, \"This Time\", stalled at No. 81 in late 1985, but the next single, \"What You Need\"—released there in early 1986—became a top five Billboard hit, bringing INXS its first break-out US success. The single was also a top 20 hit in Canada and reached No. 2 in Australia (September 1985), but only reached No. 51 on the UK charts. The British press dismissed the album, with New Musical Express calling the band \'INX-cusable\' and a reviewer declaring Listen Like Thieves to be a \'complete and utter turkey\'. In the United States, however, Rolling Stone wrote: \"INXS rocks with passion and seals the deal with a backbeat that\'ll blackmail your feet.\"\r\n\r\nIn August 1985, INXS toured ahead of the release of Listen Like Thieves, touring South America before returning to Melbourne to play for Prince Charles and Princess Diana of Wales at a concert. The concert was filmed and later released on a home video entitled Living INXS; an edited version of the concert was played on MTV in the U.S. in 1985 on its Saturday night concert series. In November, December, January, and February, INXS toured North America, Europe, and New Zealand. The band then took a two-month break, with Andrew Farriss writing and producing \"You\'re Gonna Get Hurt\" for Jenny Morris (who had previously been a backing vocalist with the band), and Hutchence featuring in Richard Lowenstein\'s second feature film Dogs in Space. Lowenstein had previously made the video clip for \"Dancing on the Jetty\". Whilst a song from the movie, \"Rooms for the Memory\", written by Ollie Olsen, with vocals by Hutchence charted, the movie was received well by critics but was not a commercial success. Beginning in May 1986, the band performed 32 European shows (including support for Queen at their Live at Wembley \'86 concert on 12 July), 42 U.S. shows, and 12 Australian shows. America\'s influential Musician magazine called INXS \"the best live band in the world.\"\r\n\r\nFrom \"Good Times\" to Kick\r\nWhilst on an eight-month break before beginning work on a new album, their manager Murphy decided to stage a series of major outdoor concerts across Australia, featuring INXS, Jimmy Barnes, Models, Divinyls, Mental as Anything, The Triffids and I\'m Talking. To promote the tour INXS recorded two songs with Jimmy Barnes of Cold Chisel: The Easybeats cover \"Good Times\" and \"Laying Down the Law\" which Barnes co-wrote with Beers, Andrew Farriss, Jon Farriss, Hutchence and Pengilly. \"Good Times\" was used as the theme song for the Australian Made series of concerts in the summer of 1986–1987. It peaked at No. 2 on the Australian charts, and months later was featured in the Joel Schumacher film The Lost Boys and its soundtrack, allowing it to peak at No. 47 in the US on 1 August 1987. After the success of \"What You Need\" and Listen Like Thieves, the band knew their new material would have to be even better and wanted every song on the album to be good enough to be a single. They recorded Kick in Sydney and Paris, and it was produced by Chris Thomas. According to the 2005 official autobiography, Atlantic Records was not happy with the result; the label offered the band $1 million to go back to Australia and record another album, but the band declined.\r\n\r\nDespite Atlantic\'s protests, Kick was released in October 1987 and provided the band with worldwide popularity. The album peaked at No. 1 in Australia, No. 3 on the US Billboard 200, No. 9 in UK, and No. 15 in Austria. It was an upbeat, confident album that yielded four Top 10 US singles: No. 1 single \"Need You Tonight\", \"Devil Inside\", \"New Sensation\", and \"Never Tear Us Apart\". \"Need You Tonight\" peaked No. 2 on the UK charts, No. 3 in Australia, and No. 10 in France. The band toured heavily behind the album throughout 1987 and 1988. The video for the 1987 INXS track \"Mediate\" (which played after the video for \"Need You Tonight\") replicated the format of Bob Dylan\'s video for \"Subterranean Homesick Blues\", even in its use of apparently deliberate errors. In September 1988, the band swept the MTV Video Music Awards with the video for \"Need You Tonight/Mediate\" winning in 5 categories. Kick was, by far, INXS\'s best-selling album of all time.\r\n\r\nDuring 1989, Hutchence collaborated with Ian \"Ollie\" Olsen on a side project, Max Q, the two had previously worked together on Lowenstein\'s film Dogs in Space. The rest of the band also took a break to work on side projects, but soon returned to the studio to record their follow-up album to Kick.\r\n\r\n1990–1997: From X to Elegantly Wasted\r\nIn October 1990, INXS released X, which was produced by Chris Thomas. The album peaked at No. 3 in Australia, No. 5 in the US, No. 2 in the UK, No. 5 in Switzerland and No. 10 in Sweden. It followed in the same vein as Kick, and added harmonica to some songs. X scored hits with \"Suicide Blonde\" and \"Disappear\" (both Top 10 in the US). \"Suicide Blonde\" peaked at No. 2 in Australia, No. 11 in the UK and in Switzerland. Other singles from X were \"Bitter Tears\" and \"By My Side\", which had less chart success.\r\n\r\nINXS performed at Wembley Stadium on 13 July 1991, during their \"Summer XS\" tour stop in London to a sold-out audience of 74,000 fans. This performance was recorded and filmed to become Live Baby Live, a live album that was released in November 1991 and peaked in the Top 30 in the Australia and UK album charts. The album had less success on The Billboard 200. A video version of the album was also released under the same title. This concert was the band\'s most well-attended show of all time; according to a 2017 article by Paul Donoughue of ABC.net.au, it \"solidified [INXS\'s] place in pop history\".\r\n\r\nOn 28 March 1992, INXS performed at the controversial Concert for Life at Centennial Park in Sydney (a fundraiser for the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Centre), and other performers included Crowded House, Yothu Yindi, Jenny Morris, Diesel, Ratcat and Def FX. Due to inclement weather, the expected attendance of 100,000 never came through, and the event only raised $500,000.\r\n\r\nWelcome to Wherever You Are, produced by Mark Opitz and released in August 1992, was an experimental album using sitars and a 60-piece orchestra while adding a more \"raw\" sound. It received good critical reviews and went No. 1 in the UK and in Sweden; No. 2 in Australia and Switzerland, and No. 3 in Norway, but had less chart success in the US (peaking at No. 16). Singles from the album included \"Taste It\" and \"Baby Don\'t Cry\", which were Top 20 successes in UK but had less success in US and Australian markets.\r\n\r\nFull Moon, Dirty Hearts, produced by Opitz, was released in November 1993 and peaked at No. 3 on the UK charts, No. 4 in Australia, No. 8 in Sweden, No. 9 in Switzerland, No. 14 in Norway; it did not reach the Top 50 in the US. The title track featured The Pretenders\' Chrissie Hynde, and another track--\"Please (You Got That)\"—featured Ray Charles. The band made a full video album for the record using unknown Australian students to direct with help from Richard Lowenstein. Full Moon, Dirty Hearts received mixed reviews, and was the last record under INXS\' contract with Atlantic in the States. The band took time off to rest and be with their families, while Hutchence remained in the public eye through modelling and film acting.\r\n\r\nIn 1997, the group released a comeback album titled Elegantly Wasted, which garnered mixed reviews. It fared respectably in Australia (No. 14), Canada (No. 14), France (No. 30), UK (No. 16) (where INXS had more success in the 1990s than in the 1980s), Belgium (No. 7), Switzerland (No. 13), but only No. 41 in US.\r\n\r\nOn 22 November 1997, Michael Hutchence was found dead in his Sydney Ritz-Carlton hotel room. On 6 February 1998, New South Wales State Coroner Derrick Hand presented his report, which ruled that Hutchence\'s death was a suicide while depressed and under the influence of drugs and alcohol. Despite the official coroner\'s report, there was continued speculation that Hutchence\'s death was accidental.\r\n\r\n1997–2003: Transitional years\r\nAfter Hutchence\'s death, INXS did not perform publicly for almost a year, and then only made a few one-off performances with different guest singers until 2000. On 28 November 1998, they played at the Mushroom 25 Concert with Jimmy Barnes fronting for two songs: \"The Loved One\" and \"Good Times\". On 12 June 1999, they headlined the opening of Stadium Australia in Sydney, with US singer-songwriter Terence Trent D\'Arby and Russell Hitchcock as guest vocalists, they performed \"New Sensation\", \"Kick\", \"Never Tear Us Apart\" and \"What You Need\".\r\n\r\nIn December 2000, INXS performed a concert with singers Suze DeMarchi and Jon Stevens sharing the spotlight. The former lead singer of Australian band Noiseworks, Jon Stevens began singing with INXS on regular basis. INXS played as one of the headline acts at the Sydney 2000 Olympics and then toured through South America and Europe. Stevens was officially named a member of INXS in 2002, and the band started recording new material in November. Stevens left the band in October 2003 to pursue a solo career, and only recorded a contractual obligation song called \"I Get Up.\"\r\n\r\n2004–2005: Rock Star: INXS\r\nINXS returned to the news in 2004 when it was announced that a new reality television program titled Rock Star: INXS would feature a contest to find a new lead vocalist for the band. The show, which debuted on the CBS network on 11 July 2005, featured 15 contestants vying for the position of lead singer. The show was executive produced by Survivor\'s Mark Burnett and hosted by Brooke Burke and Jane\'s Addiction and former Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist Dave Navarro.\r\n\r\nOn 20 September 2005, J.D. Fortune won the eleven-week competition, which culminated in his singing the Rolling Stones\'s \"You Can\'t Always Get What You Want\" and INXS\' \"What You Need\" in the finale to become the new lead singer of INXS.\r\n\r\n2005–2011: J.D. Fortune era\r\nWith Fortune as lead singer, INXS released the single \"Pretty Vegas\" on 4 October 2005. The single reached No. 5 on the iTunes Store ranking of daily most downloaded songs on its first day. It peaked at No. 9 in Australia and No. 37 on the Billboard Hot 100, and became a huge radio airplay hit in Fortune\'s native Canada. On 29 November 2005, Switch—the band\'s first album with Fortune as lead singer—was released in the United States via Epic Records. The band\'s new line-up started a world tour in support of Switch in January 2006. In September 2006, INXS and Epic Records parted ways. The band then performed at the 2006 NRL Grand Final.\r\n\r\nINXS toured Australia and New Zealand in March 2007, with Simple Minds and support band Arrested Development. After the cancellation of a 31 August 2007 show in Cleveland, Ohio, INXS placed a statement on their website stating \"Due to ongoing medical issues with Garry Beers\' hand, the band\'s doctor has urged the band to not play more than three shows in a row or risk permanent damage to Garry\'s hand.\"\r\n\r\nThe band signed with Petrol Electric Records in December 2008, reuniting them with former manager Chris Murphy. On 16 February 2009, J.D. Fortune told Entertainment Tonight Canada that INXS had let him go from the band with a shake of the hand at an airport in Hong Kong. On 23 February 2009, Chris Murphy, INXS creative director and global business strategist and former manager, in an interview with The Daily Telegraph, said J.D. was not sacked and, in fact, \"the band made it known to him that they had not ruled out seeing a return by Fortune.\" He also stated J.D. was next on his list to call regarding a major recording contract he was negotiating for the band. In an interview with Sun Media published on 6 March 2009, J.D. Fortune clarified his claim that he had been fired at an airport. After returning to Canada from Hong Kong, Fortune believed there were still two more legs of the INXS 2007 tour to complete. When the rest of the tour was cancelled and the band did not return his calls for 10 months, he believed he was out of the band.\r\n\r\nOn 30 November 2009, Andrew Farriss, Jon Farriss, and Kirk Pengilly performed an acoustic version of \"Don\'t Change\" with the Qantas Choir at the Pride of Australia Awards. On 8 December 2009, INXS announced they would be embarking on a world tour commencing with a performance in Vancouver for the 2010 Olympic Winter Games. The band announced on 11 February 2010 that J.D. Fortune would be vocalist for the performance at the 2010 Winter Olympics, but that it would be a one-off performance; the band added that a vocalist for the subsequent world tour had yet to be announced. The band performed at the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics on 24 February 2010 with guest singers J.D. Fortune and Argentine singer Deborah de Corral.\r\n\r\nOn 22 April 2010, INXS announced that Fortune would again front the band for a performance on 10 July 2010 at Townsville, QLD, Australia, and then again on 16 July 2010 in Broome, WA, Australia During a radio interview with Kirk Pengilly and J.D. Fortune in July 2010 just before the Broome concert, Pengilly confirmed that Fortune had returned as the band\'s permanent singer. In August 2010, Petrol Records issued Australian radio stations with a one-track promo \"Never Tear Us Apart\" featuring Ben Harper on vocals, a preview from the upcoming INXS Michael Hutchence tribute album Original Sin. On 25 September 2010, the band performed before the 2010 AFL Grand Final. On 19 October 2010, it was announced in the Courier Mail that INXS, fronted by J.D. Fortune, would tour as part of the A Day on the Green winery concerts in February.\"\r\n\r\nThe band recorded an album in memory of Michael Hutchence titled Original Sin. Released in November 2010, the album featured well-known singers from Australia and around the world, including Ben Harper, Patrick Monahan, and Rob Thomas.\r\n\r\nIn March 2011, INXS confirmed they would return to the United Kingdom and headlining with support from New Zealand band Shihad for an outdoor event called Southern Sounds on Clapham Common, London on Saturday 11 June. The event was an all-Australian, New Zealand and South African celebration lineup, with INXS fronted by J.D. Fortune. INXS toured extensively throughout 2011 with singer J.D. Fortune to support the album Original Sin.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring a concert on 11 November 2012 at the newly opened Perth Arena, while supporting Matchbox Twenty, INXS announced that they would no longer be touring. Kirk Pengilly stated that it was appropriate to finish where they had started 35 years earlier. Jon Farriss admitted that he was \"getting teary\" before the band performed their biggest hit, \"Need You Tonight\". In 2014, INXS released a tell-all history of the band on an Australian television interview special, The Story Behind INXS. During the interview, Jon Farriss made the statement, \"Never say never\" regarding the possibility that the band could record and perform more music in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2019, a documentary film was released about Michael Hutchence titled Mystify.

The band\'s first two albums featured lead vocalist Isaac Wood, who left the band in 2022. Their sound has been described as experimental rock, post-punk and post-rock, drawing comparisons to bands such as Slint, Arcade Fire, and black midi.\r\n\r\nThe founding members of the band originally came from the band Nervous Conditions, alongside vocalist Connor Browne and drummer Jonny Pyke. However, due to sexual assault allegations against Browne, Nervous Conditions disbanded in early 2018 and reformed later that year as Black Country, New Road without Browne and Pyke.\r\n\r\nLater adding second (at the time) guitarist Luke Mark, the band gained initial attention through debut singles Athens, France and Sunglasses in 2019.

She, along with her brother and cousin, eventually became involved with the church\'s daily program on Charlotte TV station WAXN.\r\n\r\nWaddell turned down a scholarship from Belmont University in Nashville Tennessee to pursue a full-time music career, she felt that God called her to not go to college but to concentrate on music instead In 2004 she signed a management deal with Vertical Entertainment and then signed a development - dealing with Word Records Sparrow Records signed her in 2006 and her first album Say It was released May 22, 2007 Britt Nicole was committed to the Winter Jam Tour with Sanctus Real, Hawk Nelson Jeremy Camp and Steven Curtis Chapman Newsong [1] \r\n\r\nA native of Salisbury, NC, Britt has always had a heart for reaching people and has long used music as the vehicle to change lives.  She began singing in church at age three and by the time she was in high school, was appearing on her church’s daily television program and logged a performance at New York’s famed Carnegie Hall with her school’s advanced chorus.\r\n\r\nThose early pursuits paved the way for her to sign with Sparrow Records in 2006.  She burst on the charts a year later with her label debut, “Say It,” a finely crafted pop collection that introduced us to her engaging voice and thought-provoking lyrics.  It earned her a slot on the Winter Jam tour that year with Steven Curtis Chapman, Jeremy Camp, NewSong and Hawk Nelson where she developed a reputation as a compelling live performer.\r\n\r\nIt was a whirlwind existence that found her looking to meet the needs of those around her—whether it was a girl in a youth group who needed someone to pray with or a parent seeking advice on their troubled teen.  Her servant’s heart and earnest desire to fill others up soon left Britt herself feeling empty.  It all caught up with her at an Alabama youth conference called The Ramp.  “I went with my youth group as a youth leader to support and pray for them, but near the end of the event, I was kind of worn out and I began saying ‘Okay God, I just really need You to come and do something in my life,’” Britt recalls.  She got her answer as she was driving back to Nashville.\r\n\r\n“I just felt different. I felt like the old me was gone and God had started to show me who I really was and what I was called to do,” Britt says.  “As I was driving home from the conference, everywhere I would stop, whether at a gas station or a restaurant, God was challenging me to step out and tell people about Him and His love for them.  There are so many hurting and broken people around us each day and God was showing me the importance of reaching out to them just as He would.  In the past, I have often let the fear of people and their opinions stop me from being who I am.  At the core though, I know who I am and who God has called me to be.  In letting go of my past, I was able to move forward, and instead of focusing on all my mistakes and failures, I started focusing on those around me.  That’s ultimately why I’m here, to worship God and to reach those who need to know Him.”\r\n\r\nAfter that experience, she wrote songs for the new album that included “The Lost Get Found,” “Walk on the Water,” and “Safe.”  Britt continues to explain that, “They all have a similar message of having the courage to step out in faith and walk in what God has called you to do even when it’s scary.  I don’t want to be selfish anymore.  I don’t want to be safe anymore.  When God tells me to step out and talk to somebody or believe for what seems impossible, I want to do it.”\r\n\r\nThe new album combines compelling lyrics with catchy pop songs that linger in your head such as the funky “How We Roll” and the infectious groove of “Headphones.”  “When I write songs, I often write to specific people,” she reveals.  “The first verse of ‘Headphones’ was written to a girl that I know.  She’s in middle school dealing with the pressure of fitting in.  I wanted to remind her that she does not have to look or be like anyone else because God loves her and made her just the way she is.  Sometimes it is hard to stand out and sometimes you feel alone when you do, but I know she is being a light to so many and that’s what matters.”\r\n\r\n“Feel the Light” is another song that was written for a specific friend of hers who had faced several difficult things as a child.  “She was hiding all of her pain and had never told anyone what she was going through,” shares Britt.  “Sometimes it’s easier to hide our fears, our struggles, and things that have happened to us in our past rather than talk about them.  A lot of kids I meet feel they have no one to talk to who will understand, but God promises us that when we bring everything into His light, He will heal us and we will be free.”  One of her favorite lines in the song is “you’re a queen, but you’ve never known it.”  She explains that, “The important thing to remember is that your past does not define who you are.  We all go through hard things, but it is our choice to decide how we deal with them.  The song simply says, ‘Let go and feel the light.’”\r\n\r\nOne of the most personal songs on the new record is “Have Your Way”.  “I was thinking about my brother when I wrote the song, but when I sang it in the studio, it somehow hit even closer to home,” says Britt.  “I was also reminded of Job in the Bible when I wrote the lyrics.  He went through so many things and everything was taken from him, but at the end of it all, he still fell to his knees and worshiped God and never turned his back on Him.  He just said, ‘God have Your way, whatever You want.’  I want to be like that.”  Through Britt’s achingly vulnerable vocals, you can sense the more personal nature of the song as she sings, “you never said the road would be easy, but you said you would never leave.”  “The night I sang it in the studio, I sang it laying down,” says Britt.  “I’ve never sung a vocal like that.  I always sing standing up in a vocal booth, which makes it feel more like a performance.  When I’m praying or just spending time with God, I’m usually on the floor so it just naturally felt more like I was singing to God.”\r\n\r\nIn listening to Britt Nicole’s music, it’s obvious she possesses wisdom beyond her years and a spiritual maturity not often seen in one so young.  Yet she’s very much the playful girl next door and those equally intriguing sides of her personality merge seamlessly on “The Lost Get Found.”\r\n\r\n “My fans want a pop record,” she says wistfully.  “I’m a pop artist and they love fun music.  When they come to my concerts, they want to have fun and I love that.  That’s in my personality to have fun, but the heart of who I am is to worship and to see people’s lives changed and to reach those who are hurting.  It’s what I believe God has called me to do.”\r\n\r\nSalisbury, North Carolina, United States2007 <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Britt+Nicole\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

In 2015, she started playing her songs live with her band and released the EP Habit in 2016. Snail Mail\'s debut studio album, Lush, was released on June 8, 2018. Snail Mail\'s music is heavily guitar-inspired.\r\n\r\nLindsey Jordan released her self-recorded solo EP Sticki in 2015 and played several live shows with her new band as Snail Mail. She was joined by Ryan Vieira playing bass and Shawn Durham on the drums. After completing one short DIY tour in 2016, Jordan released the EP titled Habit on Sister Polygon Records, which gained traction after being featured on several major US music sites, and they signed with Ground Control Touring. Pitchfork added the EP\'s opening track \"Thinning” to their Best New Track series.\r\n\r\nSnail Mail, with bassist Alex Bass and drummer Ray Brown, toured North America extensively 2017 supporting Priests, Girlpool, Waxahatchee and Beach Fossils. Jordan signed with Matador Records in September 2017 and the group\'s debut full-length album Lush was released on June 8th, 2018. The Snail Mail band played their first headliner tour in the beginning of 2018.\r\n\r\nIn 2019, Habit was rereleased via Matador Records along with the song “The 2nd Most Beautiful Girl In The World”.\r\n\r\nOn November 5, 2021, Snail Mail released their second studio album, Valentine, via Matador Records. The album hit number 61 on US Billboard charts and number 35 on UK and Australian charts and it was nominated for two Libera awards in 2022.\r\n\r\nOn her 2018 debut album Lush, seventeen-year-old Lindsey Jordan sang “I’m in full control / I’m not lost / Even when it’s love / Even when it’s not”. Her natural ability to be many things at once resonated with a lot of people. The contradiction of confidence and vulnerability, power and delicacy, had the impact of a wrecking ball when put to tape. It was an impressive and unequivocal career-making moment for Jordan.\r\n\r\nOn Valentine, her sophomore album out November 5th on Matador, Lindsey solidifies and defines this trajectory in a blaze of glory. In 10 songs, written over 2019-2020 by Jordan alone, we are taken on an adrenalizing odyssey of genuine originality in an era in which “indie” music has been reduced to gentle, homogenous pop composed mostly by ghostwriters. Made with careful precision, Valentine shows an artist who has chosen to take her time. The reference points are broad and psychically stirring, while the lyrics build masterfully on the foundation set by Jordan’s first record to deliver a deeper understanding of heartbreak.\r\n\r\nCurrent accompanying band\r\nAlex Bass – bass\r\nRay Brown – drums\r\nBenjamin Kaunitz - guitar, backing vocals \r\nMadeline McCormack - guitar, keyboards\r\n\r\nPast members\r\nRyan Vieira – bass\r\nShawn Durham – drums <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Snail+Mail\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

He attended Hope College on the west coast of Michigan.\r\n\r\nThe name Sufjan is an Arabic/Persian name that predates Islam and most famously belonged to Abu Sufyan, a figure from early Islamic history. It has been mentioned in the press that the name was given to Stevens by the leader of Subud, a spiritual sect to which his parents belonged when he was born. Stevens has stated that the name is of Armenian origin and means \"comes with a sword,\" and that it is \"a charming militaristic Muslim name.\" In fact the name is not Armenian, and Armenia is a predominantly Christian country.\r\nSufjan is also the plural form of Sufi in Persian . Sufi is a practitioner of Sufism .This word is frequently used in the old Persian literature ,specially Sufi poetry .  \r\n\r\nHis brother, marathonist Marzuki Stevens, has trained to compete in the 2008 Olympic trials, and has played on two of Sufjan\'s albums.\r\n\r\nA multi-instrumentalist, Stevens plays the banjo, guitar, drums, and several other instruments, often playing all of these on his albums through the use of multi-tracking. While in school, he studied the oboe and English horn, which he also plays on his albums; he is one of the few musicians in popular music to use these instruments.\r\n\r\nCareer\r\n\r\nSufjan Stevens began his musical career as a member of Marzuki, a folk-rock band from Holland, Michigan. He also played (and continues to play) various instruments for Danielson Famile. While in school at Hope College, Stevens wrote and recorded his debut solo album, A Sun Came, which he released on Asthmatic Kitty Records, a record label he founded with his step-father in 1999. He later moved to New York City, where he was enrolled in a writing program at the New School for Social Research.\r\n\r\nWhile in New York, Stevens composed and recorded the music for his second album, Enjoy Your Rabbit, a song cycle based around the animals of the Chinese Zodiac that ventured into electronica.\r\n\r\nStevens followed this with the first of his 50 states albums, a collection of folk songs and instrumentals inspired by his home state of Michigan. The result, the expansive Michigan, included odes to cities including Detroit and Flint, the Upper Peninsula, and vacation areas such as Tahquamenon Falls. Melded into the scenic descriptions and characters are his own declarations of faith in God, sorrow, love and the regeneration of Michigan.\r\n\r\nFollowing the release of Michigan, Stevens compiled a collection of songs recorded previously into a side project, the Christian folk album Seven Swans, which was released in March 2004.\r\n\r\nNext he released the second in the 50 states projects, entitled Come On Feel The Illinoise!. Among the subjects explored on Come On Feel The Illinoise! are the cities of Chicago, Decatur and Jacksonville, the serial killer John Wayne Gacy, the poet Carl Sandburg, and Mississippi Palisades State Park.\r\n\r\nHe has contributed to the music of Denison Witmer, Soul Junk, Half-handed Cloud, Brother Danielson, Danielson Famile, Serena Maneesh, Castanets, and Liz Janes. He played piano on for fellow Brooklyn musician\'s The National\'s album 2007 Boxer. A cover of \"She Is\" is included on the album Dream Brother, released in the United States on January 31, 2006.\r\n\r\nSufjan contributed a lot to the sound of the 2001 Liz Janes album Done Gone Fire as he engineered, recorded, produced and arranged it as well as playing many addition instruments.\r\n\r\nSufjan recently recorded with Rosie Thomas and Denison Witmer playing banjo and providing vocals. It is unknown how this record will be released. In April 2006, Pitchfork erroneously announced that Stevens and Thomas were having a baby together, but were forced to print a retraction. Witmer and Thomas later admitted it was an April Fools\' prank.\r\n\r\nThe Fifty States Project\r\n\r\nBeginning with Michigan, Stevens announced an intent to write an album for each of the 50 U.S. states, although in interviews he wavers between utter sincerity and self-deprecating irony when describing the idea.\r\n\r\nStevens spent the second half of 2004 researching and writing material for the second of these projects, this time focusing his efforts on Illinois. As with Michigan, Stevens used the state of Illinois as a leaping-off point for his more personal explorations of faith, family, love, and location. \r\n\r\nThe widely acclaimed Illinois was the highest rated album of 2005 on the Metacritic review aggregator site, based on glowing reviews from Pitchfork, The Onion A/V Club, Spin, Billboard, Entertainment Weekly, Rolling Stone, The New York Times, and The Guardian. The 2006 PLUG Independent Music Awards awarded Stevens with the Album Of The Year, Best Album Art/Packaging, and Male Artist Of The Year. Pitchfork Media and Paste Magazine named Come On Feel The Illinoise! as the editors\' choice for best album of 2005 and Stevens received the 2005 Pantheon prize, awarded to albums selling 500,000 copies or fewer, for Come On Feel The Illinoise!. In April of 2006, Stevens announced that 21 pieces of music he had culled from the Come On Feel The Illinoise! recording sessions would be incorporated into a new album, called The Avalanche. The album was released on July 11, 2006.\r\n\r\nWhile there were other projects rumored to be released following 2005\'s Illinois, by 2009 and his live album The BQE, he was seemingly finished with the project, calling it \"Such a joke\", and accepting that the project was too massive and too cliché to ever reach an end.\r\n\r\nReligious themes\r\n\r\nMany of Stevens\' songs have religious and spiritual allusions, but his album Seven Swans has the most direct religious references. Stevens has expressed that he is Christian, but does not overtly advertise this aspect of himself in his music. Stevens has also stated that he does not try to make music \"with a message\", or music for the sake of preaching. \"I don\'t think music media is the real forum for theological discussions,\" says Stevens. \"I think I\'ve said things and sung about things that probably weren\'t appropriate for this kind of forum. And I just feel like it\'s not my work or my place to be making claims and statements, because I often think it\'s misunderstood.\"\r\n\r\nThe songs \'Abraham\', \'Seven Swans\', \'To Be Alone With You\', \'We Won\'t Need Legs To Stand\' and \'The Transfiguration\' directly address Christianity on the album Seven Swans. In \'Abraham\', Sufjan recounts the Old Testament story in the Book of Genesis when Abraham, ordered by God as a test of faith, leads his son, Isaac, up a mountain and prepares to kill him, as commanded (but before God sends an angel to intervene). The lyrics of \'The Transfiguration\' follow the Biblical accounts of Jesus\' Transfiguration in Matthew 17:1-8, Mark 9: 1-8, and Luke 9:28-36.\r\n\r\nMichigan and Come On Feel The Illinoise! are packed with Christian references and metaphors. Michigan contains \"Sleeping Bear, Sault Saint Marie\", which implores \"Oh Lamb of God! Tell us Your perfect design and give us the rod\" (\"Lamb of God\" being a Biblical name for Jesus Christ). The song \"Oh God, Where Are You Now?\" asks God to \"hold me now\", to \"save somehow\", searching for God in the midst of personal turmoil. \"There\'s no other man who could save the dead,\" the song states. The album closer, \'Vito\'s Ordination Song\', was apparently originally written for Sufjan\'s friend Vito Aiuto, and its lyrics allude directly to Psalm 139 (\"I always knew you. In your mother\'s arms, I have called your name\", \"I\'ve made a crown for you\"). The song speaks of \"When the bridegroom comes\" - the New Testament speaks of Jesus Christ as being the Bridegroom and the Church His Bride, finally being united together at the End of Time.\r\n\r\nCome On Feel The Illinoise! features the song \'Chicago\' with its refrain of \"You came to take us, to recreate us\", and \'Decatur\' has the chorus of \"It\'s the great I Am\" (\"I Am\" being the name the Lord reveals Himself by to Moses in Exodus 3:14). \"Casimir Pulaski Day\" speaks of \"All the glory that the Lord has made\" in the midst of personal pain and loss. \"The Predatory Wasp of the Palisades Is Out To Get Us!\" has the lyrics: \"Lamb of God, we sound the horn. Hallelujah!\" One instrumental passage has the title of \"In This Temple as in the Hearts of Man for Whom He Saved the Earth\". \"The Seer\'s Tower\" speaks of Emanuel, \"With His sword, with His robe He comes dividing man from brothers\" (an interesting side note is that \"Sufjan\" actually means \"comes with a sword\"). Indeed, the vast majority of songs of Come On Feel The Illinoise! contain lyric lines which can be readily identified as having a basis in Stevens\' faith in Christ.\r\n\r\nSufjan\'s second, electronic album, Enjoy Your Rabbit, contains a song cycle based on of the animals of the Chinese Zodiac, culminating with the song \"Year of our Lord\". Stevens released the original, Christian-themed song \"God\'ll Ne\'er Let You Down\" on the \"To Spirit Back the Mews\" compilation on Asthmatic Kitty. The officially unreleased Christmas albums Sufjan Stevens made and then compiled into Songs for Christmas feature suitably Christmas and Christian themed music, both originals and covers of hymns and traditional songs.\r\n\r\nTrivia\r\n\r\nOn Snow Patrol\'s 2006 album Eyes Open there is a reference to Sufjan and the song \"Chicago\" in the song \"Hands Open\" - \"Put Sufjan Stevens on and we\'ll play your favorite song/\"Chicago\" bursts to life and your sweet smile remembers you.\"\r\n\r\nSufjan has twice been featured on the FOX television show \"The OC\". \"To Be Alone With You\" and \"For The Widows In Paradise, For The Fatherless In Ypsilanti\" can be heard on episodes 202 and 315, respectively.\r\n\r\nSufjan Stevens\' music has appeared twice on the Showtime dark comedy \"Weeds\". \"All The Trees Of The Field Will Clap Their Hands\" appears on S1E02 over the end credits, and \"Holland\" appears near the end of S2E10.\r\n\r\nTwo of Sufjan\'s songs appear on the soundtrack to \"Little Miss Sunshine\": \"Chicago\" and \"No Man\'s Land\"\r\n\r\nThe song \"John Wayne Gacy, Jr.\" appears on the 3rd season of the tv show \"Nip/Tuck\".\r\n\r\n Several songs can be heard on the movie \"Driving Lessons\"\r\n\r\nYou can also hear snippets in between CSI shows on 5US\r\n\r\nIn the TV show \"Austin City Limits\", he mentioned that when he was a kid, he and his best friend saw something in the sky which they couldn\'t figure out. They thought it was a spaceship or UFO first, then an eagle or a dragon. Finally they realized it was a giant wasp. He wrote the song \"The Predatory Wasp of the Palisades is Out to Get Us!\" about the incident and mentioned that the reason they (the band) all have wings on stage is to overcome his fear of flying things.\r\n\r\nThe song \"Redford (For Yia-Yia & Pappou)\" is heard in the 2012 \"World of Red Bull\" television commercial. he is quoted as saying \"selling out never looked so good.\" and \"somebody had to pay for all of that Christmas confetti.\" referring to his recent Christmas album and supporting tour. \r\n\r\nIn 2017 Stevens wrote two Original Songs to be featured in the gay drama film “Call me by your Name”, entitled “Mystery of Love” and “Visions of Gideon”. He also made a reworked version of his Song “Futile Devices” which is also featured on the soundtrack.\r\nWebsite:http://sufjan.com <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Sufjan+Stevens\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Shinoda, Delson, Farrell and Hahn are founding members. Vocalists Mark Wakefield, Chester Bennington & drummer Rob Bourdon are former members of the band. Categorized as alternative rock, Linkin Park\'s earlier music spanned a fusion of nu metal and hip hop, while their later music features more electronica and pop elements.\r\n\r\nFormed in 1996, Linkin Park rose to international fame with their debut studio album, Hybrid Theory (2000), which became certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Released during the peak of the nu metal scene, the album\'s singles\' heavy airplay on MTV led the singles \"One Step Closer\", \"Crawling\" and \"In the End\" all to chart highly on the US Mainstream Rock chart. The lattermost also crossed over to the nation\'s Billboard Hot 100. Their second album, Meteora (2003), continued the band\'s success. The band explored experimental sounds on their third album, Minutes to Midnight (2007). By the end of the decade, Linkin Park was among the most successful and popular rock acts.\r\n\r\nThe band continued to explore a wider variation of musical types on their fourth album, A Thousand Suns (2010), layering their music with more electronic sounds. The band\'s fifth album, Living Things (2012), combined musical elements from all of their previous records. Their sixth album, The Hunting Party (2014), returned to a heavier rock sound, and their seventh album, One More Light (2017), was a substantially more pop-oriented record. Linkin Park went on a hiatus when longtime lead vocalist Bennington died in July 2017. In April 2022, Shinoda revealed the band was neither working on new music nor planning on touring for the foreseeable future. Two years later, Linkin Park was revived in September 2024, when they announced a new album, From Zero, to be released later in the year. They performed their first concert in a private studio and unveiled their new lead vocalist, Emily Armstrong, who also serves as the lead vocalist for Dead Sara.\r\n\r\nLinkin Park is among the best-selling bands of the 21st century and the world\'s best-selling music artists, having sold over 100 million records worldwide.

Initial reviews of Local Natives have drawn favourable comparisons to Arcade Fire, Fleet Foxes and Vampire Weekend.\r\n\r\nUtilizing lots of vocal harmonies and drifting, dreamlike melodies, Local Natives have an intricate sound based around the delicate interconnectedness of all of their parts.

For most of the band\'s career, they have been a power trio with drummer Tré Cool, who replaced John Kiffmeyer in 1990 before the recording of the band\'s second studio album, Kerplunk (1991). Before taking its current name in 1989, Green Day was called Blood Rage, then Sweet Children. They emerged from the late 1980s/early 1990s Bay Area punk scene that emerged from the 924 Gilman Street club in Berkeley, California. The band\'s early releases were with the independent record label Lookout! Records. In 1994, their major-label debut Dookie, released through Reprise Records, became a breakout success and eventually shipped over 10 million copies in the U.S. Alongside fellow California punk bands Bad Religion, the Offspring, Rancid, NOFX, Pennywise, and Social Distortion, Green Day is credited with popularizing mainstream interest in punk rock in the U.S.\r\n\r\nThough the albums Insomniac (1995), Nimrod (1997), and Warning (2000) did not match the success of Dookie, they were still successful, with the first two reaching double platinum status, while the last achieved gold. Green Day\'s seventh album, a rock opera called American Idiot (2004), found popularity with a younger generation, selling six million copies in the U.S. Their next album, 21st Century Breakdown, was released in 2009 and achieved the band\'s best chart performance. It was followed by a trilogy of albums, ¡Uno!, ¡Dos!, and ¡Tré!, released in September, November, and December 2012, respectively. The trilogy did not perform as well as expected commercially, in comparison to their previous albums, largely due to a lack of promotion and Armstrong entering rehab. Their twelfth studio album, Revolution Radio, was released in October 2016 and became their third to debut at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. The band\'s thirteenth studio album, Father of All Motherfuckers, was released on February 7, 2020, to mixed reception throughout the community.  Their most recent album, Saviors, was released on January 19, 2024. All albums released after Kerplunk were released through Reprise.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, a stage adaptation of American Idiot debuted on Broadway. The musical was nominated for three Tony Awards: Best Musical, Best Scenic Design, and Best Lighting Design, winning the latter two. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2015, their first year of eligibility. Members of the band have collaborated on the side projects Pinhead Gunpowder, The Network, Foxboro Hot Tubs, The Longshot, and The Coverups. They have also worked on solo careers.\r\n\r\nGreen Day has sold roughly 90 million records worldwide, making them one of the world\'s best-selling artists. The group has been nominated for 20 Grammy awards and has won five of them. These include Best Alternative Album for Dookie, Best Rock Album for American Idiot and 21st Century Breakdown, Record of the Year for \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\" and Best Musical Show Album for American Idiot: The Original Broadway Cast Recording. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Green+Day\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

They also released three EP\'s in 1986, 1988, and 1993 and two live albums, in 1999 and 2014.\r\n\r\nThe group was formed in early 1985 by Hollywood Rose members Axl Rose (vocals) and Izzy Stradlin (rhythm guitar) and L.A. Guns members Tracii Guns (lead guitar), Ole Beich (bass) and Rob Gardner (drums).  The band created its name by combining two of the members\' names. Rejected names were \"Heads of Amazon\" and \"AIDS.\" A short time later, Beich was fired and replaced by Duff McKagan, and Guns was replaced by Slash after not showing up to rehearsal. Slash had played with McKagan in Road Crew and with Stradlin during a short stint in Hollywood Rose.  On their first tour (from Sacramento, California to Duff\'s home town of Seattle), Gardner quit and was replaced by Slash\'s friend, Steven Adler.\r\n\r\nStemming from the LA rock underground, the ugly lyrics matched the sleaze of the music--driven by heavy blues licks--covering misogyny, violence, city life, sex, liquor, and hard drugs. They also, however, tended to show sensitivity and a desire to break free from the city. Subsequent albums revealed influence from bands in the vein of The Rolling Stones and Queen. \r\n\r\nTheir 1987 breakthrough, Appetite for Destruction, (18-times platinum and the highest-selling debut album of all-time), coupled with the success of the hit single \"Sweet Child O\' Mine\" in 1988, took the world by storm. \"Appetite\" was full of raunchy hard rock with blistering, anthemic guitar riffs and snarling vocals.\r\n\r\nThe followup EP, \"G N\' R Lies\", contained four songs from their debut EP, three new acoustic songs, and an acoustic version of \"You\'re Crazy\". The album sold well and got into the top 10 alongside Appetite.  By the end of the 1980s, they were one of the most popular bands in the world. \r\n\r\nSteven Adler (original drummer) was kicked out of the band due to his drug abuse and replaced by Matt Sorum. \r\n\r\nFollowing the release of G N\' R Lies, Use Your Illusion I and Use Your Illusion II made history by making the number 1 and 2 spots on the American Billboard Album chart. The albums were filled with songs that pushed Guns into a different direction, far from the Appetite era.  They surprised critics who expected hard rock songs but found more \"epic\" tracks featuring a wider range of instruments (pianos, brass instruments, various effects, etc). The main response was that instead of releasing two albums that included \"filler tracks\", they could have released one CD.  \r\n\r\nThe band then started a world tour to support the albums.  During this tour, rhythm guitarist Izzy Stradlin quit the band due to differences with Slash, Sorum and McKagan due to his newfound sobriety and Stradlin\'s anger at Rose\'s management of the band.\r\n\r\nThey played 192 shows in the 28-month tour, which set attendance records and concluded with a show in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on July 17, 1993.  This show marked the last time original members Slash and McKagan and newcomers Clarke and Sorum would play a live show with Rose.\r\n\r\nAxl began work on a new album of original material in 1993. In 1994, Gilby Clarke left the band, and was replaced with Paul Tobias. That same year, the band recorded a cover version of The Rolling Stones\' \"Sympathy for the Devil\" for the movie Interview with the Vampire. According to Slash\'s 2007 autobiography, the first version of guitar track was rejected by Axl, who wanted Slash to copy Keith Richards\' playing on the original. Reluctantly, Slash agreed and recorded another version closer to the original. Slash was further infuriated when he discovered Tobias\' guitar copying his own solo note by note layered in the final mix of the song. This would be the last recording by the original version of the band, and five years would go by before any new material came out under the Guns N\' Roses name.\r\n\r\nSlash drifted in and out of the band for the next couple of years, beginning a side project called Slash\'s Snakepit. In August 1996, GN\'R returned to the studio, even though McKagan and Sorum were simultaneously touring with their side project, Neurotic Outsiders. Eventually, only Slash and Rose were left to continue working. During this period, Slash commented in an interview, \"My relationship with Axl right now is sort of at a standstill.\" Additionally, Axl had approached guitarist Zakk Wylde (Ozzy Osbourne, Black Label Society) about jamming and possibly joining Guns N\' Roses. \r\n\r\nIn 1996 and 1997, Slash, Sorum and McKagan all left the band, leaving Rose as the only remaining charter member of the band.  The three later formed rock supergroup Velvet Revolver with former Stone Temple Pilots frontman Scott Weiland and guitarist Dave Kushner.\r\n\r\nIn 1998, a \"clean\" (i.e., profanity removed) version of Use Your Illusion was released (in the USA only), mainly so the album could be sold in Wal-Mart and K-Mart stores. The album, titled \"Use Your Illusion\" was a 1 CD compilation of the 2 albums.\r\n\r\nAlso in 1998, Axl put a new version of the band together and returned to the studio. This version of the band has been touring and recording sporadically ever since. The new band\'s membership has changed frequently, but its core members have included guitarist Robin Finck, effects man Chris Pitman, bassist Tommy Stinson (formerly of The Replacements)— as well as Paul Tobias, drummer Josh Freese and longtime GN\'R keyboardist Dizzy Reed.\r\n\r\nIn 1999, the band released one new song, \"Oh My God\", on the soundtrack of the film End of Days. The track featured additional guitar work by [arist]Dave Navarro and Gary Sunshine, Rose\'s personal guitar teacher. The song\'s release was intended to be a prelude to their new album, now officially entitled Chinese Democracy. Geffen also released Live Era \'87-\'93, a collection of live performances from various concerts during the Appetite for Destruction and Use Your Illusion tours. Also in 1999, during an interview with Kurt Loder for MTV, Axl said that he had re-recorded Appetite for Destruction with the new band, replacing two songs with \"Patience\" and \"You Could Be Mine\".\r\n\r\nIn 1999, guitarist Robin Finck departed the band in order to rejoin his former band, Nine Inch Nails, on tour. In 2000, virtuoso guitarist Buckethead joined Guns N\' Roses as a replacement for Finck. Josh Freese was replaced with Bryan \"Brain\" Mantia (formerly of Primus). Robin Finck returned to Guns N\' Roses in late 2000 to complement Buckethead on lead guitar.\r\n\r\nThe revised lineup finally made a public appearance in January 2001 with two well-received concerts, one in Las Vegas and one at the Rock in Rio Festival in Rio de Janeiro. The band played a mixture of old hits and new songs from their forthcoming album.\r\n\r\nThe new lineup played a further two shows in Las Vegas at the end of 2001. In 2002, rhythm guitarist Paul Tobias left the band because of his frustrations with life on the road. He was replaced by Richard Fortus (formerly of The Psychedelic Furs and Love Spit Love). The band then played several shows in August 2002, headlining festivals and concerts throughout Asia and Europe. They made their way to New York for a surprise appearance at the MTV Video Music Awards in September.\r\n\r\nIn 2002, the band\'s first North American tour since 1993 was organized to support Chinese Democracy. However, the opening show in Vancouver was canceled by the venue when Rose arrived late due to his plane being held up by bad weather conditions at Los Angeles airport.  A riot ensued. This tour was met with mixed results. Some concerts did not sell well, while shows in larger markets such as New York sold out in minutes. Due to a second riot by fans in Philadelphia, tour promoter Clear Channel canceled the remainder of the tour.\r\n\r\nThe band went on hiatus until they were scheduled to play at Rock in Rio IV in May 2004. However, Buckethead left the band in March of that year, causing them to cancel. Also in March 2004, Geffen released Guns N\' Roses\' Greatest Hits, since Rose had failed to deliver a new studio album in more than 10 years. Rose expressed displeasure with this album as its track listing was established without his consent and went as far as trying to block its release by suing Geffen. This failed, however, and the album went triple platinum in the USA.\r\n\r\nIn February 2006, demos of the songs \"Better\", \"Catcher in the Rye\", \"I.R.S.\" and \"There Was a Time\" were leaked through a fan site. The band\'s management requested that all links to the MP3 files and all lyrics to the songs be removed from forums and web sites. Despite this, radio stations began adding \"I.R.S.\" to playlists, and the song reached #49 on the Radio & Records Active Rock National Airplay chart in the final week of February - the first time an internet leak had done so.\r\n\r\nOn May 5, 2006, Axl appeared on the Friday Night Rocks with Eddie Trunk radio show (during an interview with ex-Skid Row frontman Sebastian Bach) and said the new Guns N\' Roses album would be released before the end of the year. Later in May, the band launched a European tour, headlining both the Download Festival and Rock In Rio - Lisbon. Four warm-up shows preceded the tour at Hammerstein Ballroom in New York City and became the band\'s first live concert dates since the aborted 2002 tour. The shows also marked the debut of virtuoso guitarist and composer Ron \"Bumblefoot\" Thal, replacing Buckethead. During the tour, Bach and Izzy Stradlin made frequent guest appearances.  By the tour\'s end in 2007, the band had played to over 750 000 people in over 23 countries.\r\n\r\nOn April 5, 2008, a picture of Finck appeared on Nine Inch Nails web page under the title \"Welcome Back!\" starting the rumor of his possible reunion with Trent Reznor.  On April 11, Finck expressed his happiness on playing again with NIN.  On April 20, on Guns N\' Roses\' web site, Axl expressed surprise about the news.\r\n\r\nChinese Democracy had been given the tentative release date of March 6, then reported September 17, 2007. However, both dates passed with no sign of the album.  After further release dates were discussed, the album finally came out on November 23, 2008, to mostly positive critical reviews & underselling industry expectations.\r\n\r\nSlash, McKagan and Sorum still played together in Velvet Revolver. However, Izzy Stradlin, original GN\'R rhythm guitarist and co-composer of many of the band\'s most successful songs, has not joined them. He did, however, play a few dates as a guest with GN\'R in the summer of 2006. Keyboard player Dizzy Reed, while not a founding member of the band (joining in 1990 in the Use Your Illusion period), remained in the previous lineup. in 2014, Bassist Tommy Stinson had previous commitments to The Replacements, leading former bassist Duff McKagan to fill in. After the 2014 tour, bassist Tommy Stinson, guitarists  DJ Ashba & Ron \"Bumblefoot\" Thal, and keyboardist Chris Pitman  all left the band. \r\n\r\nSlash and McKagan rejoined in 2016, as did keyboardist Melissa Reese, as the group embarked on the \"Not in This Lifetime...\" stadium tour. The tour also featured several guest appearances, including from former drummer Steven Adler, AC/DC guitarist Angus Young, former Skid Row singer Sebastian Bach, and Rose Tattoo singer Angry Anderson. The tour was a massive success, becoming the third highest grossing concert tour of all-time by its end in 2019. \r\n\r\nThe band continued with the Guns N’ Roses 2020 Tour and in 2021 released two new singles “Absurd” and “Hard Skool”, both reworkings of ‘’Chinese Democracy’’ era tracks. The singles are the first songs released featuring Slash and Duff McKagan since 1994.\r\n\r\nGN\'R\'s current lineup includes Rose (lead vocals), McKagan (bass), Fortus (rhythm guitar), Slash (lead guitar), Melissa Reese[/bandember] (synth & programming), Frank Ferrer (drums) and Reed (keyboard and percussion). \r\n\r\nDiscography\r\nAppetite for Destruction (1987) #1 US Billboard, 18x Platinum\r\nG N\' R Lies (1988) #2 US Billboard, 5x Platinum \r\nUse Your Illusion I (1991) #2 US Billboard, 7x Platinum \r\nUse Your Illusion II (1991) #1 US Billboard, 7x Platinum \r\nThe Spaghetti Incident?

They are considered a very-early heavy metal band as a result of this song and others like it as well as the title of their debut album, \'Heavy\'. Their heyday was the late-60s, but the band has been reincarnated several times with various members. Also known for being the first RIAA certified platinum group, VH1 ranks them as number 19 on their list of top 100 \"one hit wonders\".\r\n\r\nThe band was formed in 1966 in San Diego, and they released their aforementioned debut album, \'Heavy\', in 1968, after signing a deal with an Atlantic Records subsidiary called ATCO. The original members were Doug Ingle (vocals, keyboards), Jack Pinney (drums), Greg Willis (bass), and Danny Weis (guitar). They were soon joined by singer-songwriter frontman Darryl DeLoach.\r\n\r\nJerry \"The Bear\" Penrod and Bruce Morris replaced Willis and Pinney after the band relocated to Los Angeles, California in 1966, and Ron Bushy then came aboard when Morris\' tenure proved to be a short one. All but Ingle and Bushy left the band after recording the first album in late 1967; the remaining musicians, faced with the possibility of the record not being released, quickly found replacements in bassist Lee Dorman and guitarist Erik Brann (aka Erik Braunn) and resumed touring.\r\n\r\nWeis and Penrod almost immediately went on to form the group Rhinoceros. Iron Butterfly focused on putting their energies into their second album. The 17-minute \"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\", the title track of their second album, became a Top Thirty hit in the U.S. and also gained serious airplay internationally. Doug Ingle is reported to have said the title was an alcohol-slurred version of \"In the Garden of Eden\", although this is possibly apocryphal. The members when In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida was recorded were Doug Ingle (keyboards and vocals), Lee Dorman (bass guitar), Ron Bushy (drums) and 17-year-old Erik Brann, also Braunn (guitar). The song has been a radio staple for decades and also has prominently featured in several films.\r\n\r\nThe band had been booked to play at Woodstock, but got stuck at an airport. When their manager called the promoters of the concert, they explained the incredible situation they had been dealt and asked for patience. However, the manager demanded that the Butterfly be flown in by helicopter whereupon they would \"immediately\" take the stage. After their set they would be paid and flown back to the airport. The manager was told that this would be taken into consideration and he would be called back. In truth, his outrageous demands were never given a second thought. Dorman later expressed regret at this turn of events feeling the band\'s career may have gone further had they played the festival.\r\n\r\nThe next album, Ball, topped the charts but more lineup changes followed. In 1970 with Erik Braunn gone, Iron Butterfly released their fourth album, Metamorphosis with two new members, guitarist / vocalist / songwriter Mike Pinera (whose Blues Image had opened for the Butterfly\'s Vida tour and who later led Ramatam and played with Alice Cooper) and guitarist Larry \"Rhino\" Reinhardt. The album only managed to get into the top twenty. The band broke up after playing a final show on May 23, 1971. Dorman and Reinhardt later became members of the supergroup Captain Beyond.\r\n\r\nThe band re-formed in 1974 with Ron Bushy and Eric Braunn joined by bassist Philip Taylor Kramer and keyboardist Howard Reitzes. (Kramer later made news with his 1995 disappearance and the discovery of his bones and minivan at the bottom of Decker Canyon in 1999). The albums released during this lineup: Scorching Beauty in January 1975 with Reitzes and Sun and Steel in October 1975 with Bill DeMartines replacing Reitzes.\r\n\r\nFrom 1977 on Dorman took over the IB moniker and has led several lineups since then(see below for a chronology of IB\'s lineups) with former members(including Bushy, Ingle, Braunn, etc., coming and going). Other than another brief break between late 1985 and early 1987, the group has continued to this day with Dorman & Bushy currently leading the charge.\r\n\r\nThe famous line-up of In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida got together for the Atlantic Recording Corporation\'s 40th anniversary concert and celebration, appearing on stage along with the surviving members of Led Zeppelin, and with Aretha Franklin among many other acts of the company\'s roster on May 14th, 1988. The reunited foursome also played a 30 city tour that same year.\r\n\r\nOn October 3, 2002, original guitarist/vocalist Darryl DeLoach died of liver cancer at the age of 56.\r\n\r\nOn July 25, 2003 Erik Brann died of cardiac failure at the age of 52. He was working on a new solo album at the time of his death. The album to date remains unreleased, although friends and family of Brann are working on seeing its release.\r\n\r\nIron Butterfly is now working on a new album. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Iron+Butterfly\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The band consists of Ben Gibbard (vocals, guitar, piano), Nicholas Harmer (bass), Jason McGerr (drums), Dave Depper (guitar) and Zac Rae (keyboards).\r\n\r\nDeath Cab began as a solo project of Ben Gibbard, now the band\'s vocalist and guitarist. Gibbard took the band name from the satirical song Death Cab for Cutie, performed by The Bonzo Dog Band in The Beatles\' 1967 experimental film Magical Mystery Tour. As Death Cab for Cutie, Gibbard released a cassette titled You Can Play These Songs with Chords; the release was surprisingly successful, and Gibbard decided to expand the band into a complete project. He recruited Chris Walla (who had also worked on the cassette) as an electric guitarist, Nick Harmer as bass guitarist, and Nathan Good to play drums. \r\n\r\nThe four released the LP Something About Airplanes on August 18th 1998. The album was favorably reviewed in the independent music scene, and in 2000 the band released We Have the Facts and We\'re Voting Yes. Nathan Good left the band at some point during this album\'s production. His playing on “The Employment Pages” and “Company Calls Epilogue” were kept, but Gibbard played drums on all other songs.\r\n\r\nMichael Schorr would first appear on The Forbidden Love E.P., released on October 24, 2000. In 2001, another LP was released, entitled The Photo Album. Limited editions of this album contained three bonus tracks, which were later released separately as The Stability EP.\r\n\r\nIn 2003, there was another change of drummer, with Jason McGerr of Eureka Farm replacing Schorr. McGerr would play drums on the next release, Transatlanticism.\r\n\r\nTransatlanticism was released in October of 2003. It received critical praise and also became the band\'s top-selling album, with 225,000 copies sold during its first year out.\r\n\r\nIn spring of 2004, the band recorded a live E.P. titled The John Byrd E.P., named for their sound engineer. The E.P. was released on Barsuk Records in March 2004.\r\n\r\nIn November of 2004, Death Cab for Cutie signed a “long-term worldwide deal” with Atlantic Records, leaving their long-time label Barsuk Records. Gibbard stated on the official website www.deathcabforcutie.com that nothing would change except that “Next to the picture of Barsuk holding a 7\", there will be the letter \"A\" on both the spine and back of our upcoming albums.” This was a marked change from Gibbard\'s earlier views on major-label relations, which he said “are set up to fuck you and take all your money.”. After signing to Atlantic, the band was still nervous about corporate economics, and encouraged fans to download its songs from the Internet.\r\n\r\nThe first and second singles off the band\'s Atlantic Record release Plans were “Soul Meets Body” and “Crooked Teeth”, respectively. The full album was released in August of 2005. Plans was somewhat well-acclaimed by critics and fans, and received a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album of 2005. It achieved Gold Status in 2006 after charting on Billboard for 47 consecutive weeks.\r\n\r\nThe band released a touring DVD titled Drive Well, Sleep Carefully in 2005. Known for their contributions to animal rights, the band is supporting the activist group PETA in giving away copies of the DVD to promote animal rights.\r\n\r\nIn early 2006, the band announced the upcoming release of Directions, eleven short films inspired by songs from the Plans album, each directed by a different person. The videos were posted one at a time at the band\'s website and the DVD went on sale April 11, 2006.\r\n\r\nOn May 12, 2008 their album, Narrow Stairs, was released  and was well received by both critics and fans. It was their first album to reach #1 on the Billboard 200. The album contains the singles \"I Will Possess Your Heart\", \"Cath...\" and \"Grapevine Fires\".\r\n\r\nThe band\'s latest released The Open Door EP, which was released on March 31, 2009. Their main styles consist of slow progressive rock with dark lyrics.\r\n\r\nThe band\'s seventh album, Codes and Keys, was released on May 31, 2011. The album\'s first single was \"You Are A Tourist\".\r\n\r\nOn October 11, 2013, the band reportedly began working on their eighth studio album. This was then confirmed by the group\'s official Instagram profile in which an image was uploaded with the caption \"DCFC LP8 begins\". The new album will be produced by Rich Costey and is expected to be released in early 2015. In an interview with Stereogum, Gibbard said of the new album, \"I do think from start to finish it\'s a much better record than Codes And Keys. If that record turned anybody off, I feel pretty strongly that this one could win them back. There are threads in this one that connect back to our earliest stuff that people love.\" On October 29, 2013, the band released a remastered tenth-anniversary version of their 2003 album Transatlanticism. The new album included a vinyl LP and MP3 download, with demos for all the songs from the album.\r\n\r\nAs part of the 2014 Record Store Day, the band released its first live album, a vinyl-only double LP recorded during various 2012 tour dates with Magik*Magik Orchestra. Included within the packaging was a code for a digital download of the recording.\r\n\r\nOn August 13, 2014, after 17 years as a member of Death Cab for Cutie, guitarist and songwriter Chris Walla decided to part ways with the band, with his last performance occurring on September 13, 2014 at the Rifflandia Music Festival in Victoria, British Columbia. Walla states that he plans to \"...continue making music, producing records, and erring on the side of benevolence and beauty whenever possible.\" When asked in an interview about Walla\'s involvement in the eighth album, McGerr confirmed that Walla \"played on everything and has been involved all the way through, even in the mixing. Even though he\'s played his last show with us, he\'s still been involved in everything involving this record.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Death+Cab+for+Cutie\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

They decided to form a band and rehearsed on Sundays, first singing songs in English before choosing to sing in French, inspired by bands like La Femme and Fauve2.

Cash; February 26, 1932 – September 12, 2003) was an American singer, guitarist, actor, songwriter, author. He is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 90 million records worldwide. Although primarily remembered as a country music icon, his genre-spanning songs and sound embraced rock and roll, rockabilly, blues, folk, and gospel.\r\n\r\nCash was known for his deep, calm bass-baritone voice, the distinctive sound of his Tennessee Three backing band characterized by train-sound guitar rhythms, a rebelliousness coupled with an increasingly somber and humble demeanor, free prison concerts, and a trademark, all-black stage wardrobe, which earned him the nickname \"The Man in Black.\" He traditionally began his concerts by simply introducing himself, \"Hello, I\'m Johnny Cash,\" followed by his signature song \"Folsom Prison Blues\".\r\n\r\nMuch of Cash\'s music contained themes of sorrow, moral tribulation, and redemption, especially in the later stages of his career. His other signature songs include \"I Walk the Line\", \"Ring of Fire\", \"Get Rhythm\", and \"Man in Black\". He also recorded humorous numbers like \"One Piece at a Time\" and \"A Boy Named Sue\"; a duet with his future wife, June Carter, called \"Jackson\" (followed by many further duets after their wedding); and railroad songs including \"Hey, Porter\", \"Orange Blossom Special\", and \"Rock Island Line\". During the last stage of his career, Cash covered songs by several late 20th-century rock artists, notably \"Hurt\" by Nine Inch Nails and \"Rusty Cage\" by Soundgarden.\r\n\r\nJohnny Cash was born on February 26, 1932, in Kingsland, Arkansas, to Ray Cash and Carrie Cloveree (née Rivers). He was the fourth of seven children, who were in birth order: Roy, Margaret Louise, Jack, J. R., Reba, Joanne, and Tommy (who also became a successful country artist). He was primarily of English and Scottish descent. As an adult he traced his surname to 11th-century Fife, after meeting with the then-laird of Falkland, Major Michael Crichton-Stuart. Cash Loch and other locations in Fife bear the name of his family.\r\n\r\nAt birth, Cash was named J. R. Cash. When Cash enlisted in the United States Air Force, he was not permitted to use initials as a first name, so he changed his name to John R. Cash. In 1955, when signing with Sun Records, he started going by Johnny Cash.\r\n\r\nIn March 1935, when Cash was three years old, the family settled in Dyess, Arkansas, a New Deal colony established to give poor families a chance to work land that they had a chance to own as a result. Cash started working in cotton fields at the age of five, singing along with his family while working. The Cash farm experienced a flood during the family\'s time in Dyess, which led Cash later to write the song \"Five Feet High and Rising\". His family\'s economic and personal struggles during the Great Depression inspired many of his songs, especially those about other people facing similar difficulties. Consequently, Cash had sympathy for the poor and working class throughout his life.\r\n\r\nCash was very close to his older brother, Jack. On Saturday May 12, 1944, Jack was pulled into an unguarded table saw at his high school while cutting oak into fence posts as his job and was almost cut in two. He lingered until the following Saturday, when he died. Cash often spoke of the horrible guilt he felt over this incident; according to Cash: The Autobiography, his father was away that morning, but Johnny, his mother, and even Jack himself, all had premonitions or a sense of foreboding about that day. His mother urged Jack to skip work and go fishing with his brother, but Jack insisted on working since the family needed the money at the time. On his deathbed, Jack said he had visions of Heaven and angels. Decades later, Cash spoke of looking forward to meeting his brother in Heaven.\r\n\r\nCash\'s early memories were dominated by gospel music and radio. Taught guitar by his mother and a childhood friend, Cash began playing and writing songs at the age of 12. When young, Cash had a high-tenor voice, before becoming a bass-baritone after his voice changed.\r\n\r\nIn high school, he sang on a local radio station. Decades later, he released an album of traditional gospel songs, called My Mother\'s Hymn Book. He was also significantly influenced by traditional Irish music, which he heard performed weekly by Dennis Day on the Jack Benny radio program.\r\n\r\nIn 1997, Cash was diagnosed with the neurodegenerative disease Shy–Drager syndrome, a form of multiple system atrophy. According to biographer Robert Hilburn, the disease was originally misdiagnosed as Parkinson\'s disease, and Cash even announced to his audience that he had Parkinson\'s after nearly collapsing on stage in Flint, Michigan, on October 25, 1997. Soon afterwards, his diagnosis was changed to Shy–Drager, and Cash was told he had about 18 months to live. The diagnosis was later again altered to autonomic neuropathy associated with diabetes. The illness forced Cash to curtail his touring. He was hospitalized in 1998 with severe pneumonia, which damaged his lungs.\r\n\r\nDuring the last stage of his career, Cash released the albums American III: Solitary Man (2000) and American IV: The Man Comes Around (2002). American IV included cover songs by several late 20th-century rock artists, notably \"Hurt\" by Nine Inch Nails and \"Personal Jesus\" by Depeche Mode. Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails commented that he was initially skeptical about Cash\'s plan to cover \"Hurt\", but was later impressed and moved by the rendition. The video for \"Hurt\" received critical and popular acclaim, including a Grammy Award.\r\n\r\nJune Carter Cash died on May 15, 2003, at the age of 73. June had told Cash to keep working, so he continued to record, completing 60 more songs in the last four months of his life, and even performed a few surprise shows at the Carter Family Fold outside Bristol, Virginia. At the July 5, 2003, concert (his last public performance), before singing \"Ring of Fire\", Cash read a statement about his late wife that he had written shortly before taking the stage:\r\n\r\n\"The spirit of June Carter overshadows me tonight with the love she had for me and the love I have for her. We connect somewhere between here and Heaven. She came down for a short visit, I guess, from Heaven to visit with me tonight to give me courage and inspiration like she always has. She\'s never been one for me except courage and inspiration. I thank God for June Carter. I love her with all my heart. \"\r\n\r\nCash continued to record until shortly before his death. His final recordings were made on August 21, 2003, and consisted of \"Like the 309\", which appeared on American V: A Hundred Highways in 2006, and the final song he completed, \"Engine 143\", which was recorded for his son John Carter Cash for a planned Carter Family tribute album. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Johnny+Cash\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

He has released one album as frontman of the Chris Lane Band and a second album, Girl Problems, and a third album, Laps Around the Sun, via Big Loud Records. \r\n\r\nLane\'s signature is the falsetto. In Lane\'s hands, mixing those earth-shattering high notes with banjo plucks and a danceable beat (whether that dancing is done in cowboy boots or Nike sneakers) has never felt more natural, or so unique. He may have some Girl Problems, as the title of his forthcoming debut album suggests, but he has no problem at all weaving a fresh sound that both thrills country fans and encourages pop faithfuls to dip a toe into his side of the Mason-Dixon.\r\n\r\nAfter touring with Dustin Lynch, Kelsea Ballerini and Rascal Flatts, Lane has been making a name for himself as one of the genre\'s most groundbreaking new stars: his first single, \"Fix,\" is bound for the top of the country radio charts and just passed both 20 million streams on Spotify and over 3.5 million views on Vevo, making waves for how effortlessly it blends progressive pop and that sultry falsetto with his country roots. It\'s a record-breaker, too: the song has accumulated the most first week single adds from a debut male artist in Country Aircheck history, all while drawing praise from the likes of Selena Gomez, Lucy Hale, Daughtry and more. Now, Lane\'s ready to share Girl Problems with the world, his much-anticipated debut LP produced by Joey Moi (Florida Georgia Line, Jake Owen) to be released by Big Loud Records on August 5th.\r\n\r\nOriginally from North Carolina but now residing in Nashville, Lane once thought his life was heading in an entirely different direction: an ace athlete, he played football and baseball until an injury sidelined him permanently. Looking for an outlet, he turned to the guitar – he\'d always loved music growing up, and listened to everything from Garth Brooks and Usher to Justin Timberlake – and it quickly turned from a hobby into a downright passion. He started playing in a cover band and became a must-see act in town, all while starting to write his own songs, a talent that came unexpectedly easily.\r\n\r\n\"Once I got a taste of what it was like to be on stage,\" says Lane, \"and more and more people came out to the shows, I thought, \'well, I should try and write my own music.\' I sat down and wrote twelve songs. After that, it instantly felt like music was what I truly was supposed to be doing. I discovered a passion I never thought I could have.\"\r\n\r\nSoon, Nashville came calling, and it wasn\'t before long that he found himself working with Moi, who was instantly drawn to his cutting-edge originality and ability to transcend genres. One day in the studio, Lane was singing an Usher song to himself while Moi was working behind the controls – including all of the high, falsetto notes that are impossible for most to even approach. And, suddenly, a light bulb went off: they realized they could integrate those vocal abilities into Lane\'s music in way that country had never quite done before. \"I\'m so glad we discovered that,\" says Lane. \"It\'s out of the box for country music, and that\'s how I like to be.\"\r\n\r\nOnce Lane felt free to unleash those killer vocals, everything fell into place: it was the thread that laced together his diverse pop and country influences, and \"Fix,\" written by Sarah Buxton, Jesse Frasure and Abe Stoklasa, was the first piece of that puzzle (and also the title of his debut EP). Girl Problems – named as an ode not only to the difficulties of romance but the beauty of learning from missteps and mistakes - takes the ride one step further, pushing even more boundaries, packing more surprises and, most of all, always remembering to make people dance or sing along. From the smooth, R&B vibe of \"Who\'s It Gonna Be\" that absolutely smashes with its infectious, eighties-pop infused chorus; to the twang disco of \"All The Time\"; to the mid-tempo \"For Her,\" which Lane describes as his \"Backstreet Boy\" moment – if the Backstreet Boys played a little banjo – it\'s a contemporary ride from one exciting corner of the genre to the next, reinventing country with every octave.\r\n\r\n\"I love what Florida Georgia Line is doing, and what Sam Hunt has done,\" says Lane. \"They have created something that was unique to country that nobody else had tried. That\'s how I strive to create music, too. To infuse so many different aspects and influences into one unique sound, that always pushes forward.\"\r\n\r\nFlorida Georgia Line, in fact, has been a mentor of sorts to Lane – they recognized his talent early on and took him on the road before anyone barely knew his name. It was a good gamble – audiences loved his high-energy, captivating performances, and other artists like Rascal Flatts snatched him up as a tourmate, too. Tireless on the road and always on all cylinders at every show, Lane attributes his work ethic to his years as an athlete.\r\n\r\n\"I guess I\'ve gone from playing baseball in stadiums to singing in stadiums,\" Lane laughs. Either way, he\'s still hitting soaring homeruns. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Chris+Lane\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

While spending summers with his dad in Nashville, Adam found himself in and out of studios on Music Row with his uncle and professional session musician, Scotty Sanders. It was then that Adam fell in love with the recording process, and the creative side of the music business. He knew this was where he was meant to be.\r\n\r\nWith a plan of moving to Music City following high school graduation, Adam would spend as much time as possible, teaching himself to write songs about the things in life he knew about. In 2007, Adam made the move to Nashville. While working construction on the side to pay the bills, Adam’s songwriting opened to co-writing, and building core relationships in the business. \r\n\r\nAfter just two years, Adam landed his first publishing deal with Big Yellow Dog Music and has had songs recorded by super stars such as Luke Bryan, whose album Crash My Party (featuring Sanders\' \"Out Like That\") had the third highest debut of any record in 2013. Additionally, Adam just got two more songs recorded by friend, collaborator, and rising star, Cole Swindell, and has several other artists asking for more from him. His most recent cut is titled “Sounds of Summer” which is featured on Dierks Bently’s seventh studio album, Riser. Adam continues to write songs, while working on fulfilling his next goal of becoming a household name in country music. \r\n\r\nIn the fall of 2013, Adam signed with world-wide talent agency, William Morris Endeavor, and has been burning up the road, sharing stages with the likes of Luke Bryan, Eric Church, Cole Swindell, Thomas Rhett, Randy Houser, Dustin Lynch, Josh Thompson, Easton Corbin, The Cadillac Three and more.\r\n\r\nAdam Sanders is currently gearing up for his debut single release, “Nothin’ To Do But Drink”, which premiered on SiriusXM’s The Highway in June 2014. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Adam+Sanders\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The Killers is an American rock band from Las Vegas, Nevada, formed in 2001. \r\nThey got the name from the fictional band The Killers in the video for New Order\'s song Crystal. \r\nAs of 2021, the band has released six studio albums, which have sold 28 million records worldwide. \r\n\r\nThe Early Years\r\nInitially, The Killers played at large clubs in Las Vegas. With the band\'s line-up stable and their repertoire of songs expanding, the band began to attract attention from talent bookers, local agents, major label, scouts — and a UK representative for Warner Bros. Though the Warner Bros representative passed on the band, he took the demo back with him, showing it to a friend who worked at UK (London-based) indie label Lizard King Records (now Marrakesh Records). The Killers then signed in the summer of 2002 to a British label.\r\n\r\nHot Fuss\r\nThey released their debut album Hot Fuss on June 2004 in the United Kingdom and US (on Island Records). Their first single was Somebody Told Me. The band also had chart success with their singles Mr. Brightside, which reached the Top 10 in the UK when released, and All These Things That I\'ve Done.\r\n\r\nSam\'s Town\r\nThe band started recording its second album, Sam\'s Town, on February 15, 2006, at The Palms Hotel/Casino in Las Vegas. It was released on October 2006. \r\nThe first single, When You Were Young debuted on radio stations in late July 2006. In late August 2006, it was offered as a downloadable track before the album\'s debut. The single then entered the chart on downloads alone at #5, and the following week on its official release went to #2 in the UK. \r\nThe video clip of the second single, Bones, was directed by Tim Burton. \r\nThe third single was Read My Mind. The video for it was filmed in Tokyo, Japan. \r\nThe last one was For Reasons Unknown, released in June, 2007.\r\nThe album sold over 700,000 copies worldwide in the first week of release, with a No. 2 debut on the United World chart. \r\n\r\nSawdust Compilation\r\nThe compilation album Sawdust, containing B-sides, rarities, and some new material, was released on November 12, 2007. \r\nThe album\'s first single Tranquilize, a collaboration with Lou Reed, was released on October 2007. The band also released their cover of Joy Division\'s song Shadowplay on the U.S. iTunes Store. The album contains songs Ruby, Don\'t Take Your Love to Town (a The First Edition cover), Romeo and Juliet (a Dire Straits cover), and a new version of Move Away (previously available on the Spider-Man 3 soundtrack). One of the tracks on Sawdust is Leave the Bourbon On The Shelf, the first but previously unreleased part of the so called Murder Trilogy, in which it is followed by Midnight Show then Jenny Was a Friend of Mine.\r\n\r\n(Red) Christmas EP\r\nIn 2006 Songfacts reported that The Killers were recognized for their work with Bono\'s Product Red campaign, which is dedicated to fighting AIDS in Africa. \r\nIn the same year they have released their first Christmas themed song and music video, A Great Big Sled in aid of the charity, followed by Don\'t Shoot Me Santa on December 1, 2007. \r\nTheir festive tunes have subsequently became an annual event and (Red) Christmas EP intended to raise money for the Product Red campaign on November 29, 2011.\r\n\r\nDay & Age\r\nThe third album Day & Age was released on 25th November 2008 (24th November for the UK). \r\nThe album\'s first single Human was debuted on 22nd September and on the 30th September, the single was made available on iTunes, with many radio DJ\'s suggesting it was the best single by The Killers yet.\r\nKillers frontman Brandon Flowers said (in December 2008) that he thinks that his band \"will be bigger than U2 eventually, and sooner than you might think\". He told The Daily Telegraph that \"U2 are unbelievable, but they\'re getting old. It feels like it\'s time\". \r\nThe album was reviewed at Silent Soundwaves.\r\n\r\nBattle Born\r\nThe band was on hiatus, but returned to the studio to record their fourth studio album in early 2011. Songfacts reported that Runaways, the first single from the new album, was released on July 10, 2012. \r\nThe Killers\' fourth studio album, Battle Born, was released on 18 September 2012. \r\nIt took 15 months to record it.

It debuted at #8 on the Billboard 200.\r\n\r\nInfluences\r\nMuch of The Killers\' music is based on British influences and on the music of the 1980s, particularly New Wave. Flowers has also said in interviews that the larger-than-life sound of many of the band\'s songs is due to the influence of living in Las Vegas, a city where everything is about flash and who can top whom. They appreciate post-punk bands that sprang up during the 80\'s such as Joy Division, and they are also avowed fans of New Order (with whom Flowers has performed live), Pet Shop Boys, Radiohead, David Bowie, The Smiths, Morrissey, Depeche Mode, U2, Queen, Muse and Linkin Park. Their second album was said to be greatly influenced by Bruce Springsteen\'s music and lyrics.\r\n\r\nTheir line-up is:\r\nBrandon Flowers (vocals, keyboards), \r\nDave Keuning (guitar, backing vocals), \r\nMark Stoermer (bass guitar, backing vocals),\r\nRonnie Vannucci Jr. (drums, percussion). \r\n\r\n2.

Notto recruited bassist Justin Smolian, and the trio had trouble finding a drummer until Smolian brought in Corey Coverstone, who enthusiastically asked to join. Labelle came up with the name Dirty Honey after hearing Robert Plant mention his band The Honeydrippers in a Howard Stern interview and thought it sounded like such a \"dirty\" rock and roll name.\r\n\r\nAfter hearing their song \"When I\'m Gone\", the band\'s longtime friend Mark DiDia, a music industry veteran from Columbia Records, became their manager and quickly got them gigs opening for Slash in fall 2018.

He then went on to release another three full-length projects, \"Nostalgia For The Now\", \"Bad Internet Rapper\" and \"Out Of Order\".\r\n\r\nAfter amassing a large amount of attention throughout 2018 through his \"Styles of Rap\" series and KSI diss track, Quadeca began teasing a project by the title of Voice Memos.

The band members are Alexis Krauss (vocalist, lyricist) and Derek E. Miller (songwriter, guitarist, producer). Miller was formerly the guitarist for the hardcore band Poison the Well, and Krauss was a member of the teen pop group RubyBlue.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Miller was waiting tables at a neighborhood Brazilian restaurant, Miss Favela, where he encountered Alexis and her mother. When he mentioned he was looking for a female vocalist to work with on a musical project, Krauss\' mother immediately volunteered her. After steadily gaining popularity throughout 2009, Sleigh Bells signed to M.I.A.\'s label N.E.E.T. in Spring 2010.\r\n\r\nThe duo released the 7-track EP Sleigh Bells. The EP received much attention and all but the last two tracks were re-recorded for their debut album.\r\n\r\nSleigh Bells issued the single \"Tell \'Em\" as a free download in April 2010. On 11 May 2010, they released their debut full-length album entitled Treats. Amidst blown-out drum beats, fuzzed guitars and synth-pop sensibilities, Krauss balances each song with a voice that is both forceful and elegant. Four other singles supported the album: \"Crown on the Ground\", \"Infinity Guitars\", \"Rill Rill\" and \"Riot Rhythm\".\r\n\r\nSleigh Bells began recording songs for their second studio album in June 2011. Describing the sound of the new album, Krauss said, \"It sounds really huge, so there\'s going to still be tons of volume\".\r\n\r\nOn 15 December 2011, the band released the single \"Born to Lose\", followed in January 2012 by \"Comeback Kid\". The second album, Reign of Terror, was released on 21 February 2012. They made their network television debut on the 18 February 2012 episode of Saturday Night Live, performing the songs \"Comeback Kid\" and \"End of the Line\".\r\n\r\nOnly a few months after the release of Reign of Terror, Sleigh Bells began writing a third studio album for a possible 2013 release. Before the end of 2012, the album was said to feature more writing from Krauss and with a cleaner sound. The album, titled Bitter Rivals, was released on 8 October 2013, through Mom + Pop Music. According to Krauss, several tracks would feature dynamic acoustic riffs and R&B-ish vocals. In an interview with Rolling Stone magazine, Krauss clarified the new style of the album, saying, \"I was interested in doing something Beyoncé or Janet Jackson would do, these slow-winding, sparkling melodies.\"\r\n\r\nOn 7 December 2015, Sleigh Bells premiered a new song titled \"Champions of Unrestricted Beauty\", while announcing they were finishing up their fourth studio album. The duo released the single \"Rule Number One\" on 7 June 2016, followed by \"Hyper Dark\" on 19 July 2016. On 24 August 2016, Sleigh Bells released their fourth studio album Jessica Rabbit, marking the first release on the duo\'s own label, Torn Clean, in partnership with Sinderlyn. The mini-album Kid Kruschev followed on 10 November 2017.\r\n\r\nSleigh Bells released their sixth studio album, Texis, on 10 September 2021 through Mom + Pop Music.

The band currently consists of Buzz Osborne (vocals, guitar), Steven Shane McDonald (bass), and Dale Crover (drums). Osborne is the only remaining original member, although Crover has been a member since early in the band\'s career.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of their career. . . their dark, heavy, oppressively slow sound made them innovators of genres like sludge, grunge, and doom metal. The Melvins\' music is influenced by Flipper, Black Flag\'s My War-era hardcore punk and Black Sabbath-style heavy metal, but their idiosyncratic approach, bizarre sense of humor, and experimentation make neat categorization difficult. Singer/guitarist Buzz Osborne (aka \"King Buzzo\") and drummer Dale Crover are constant members while several bass guitarists have cycled through the group. The Melvins usually performed as a trio until 2006 when two members of Big Business became permanent members of the band.  \r\n\r\nThe band was named after a grocery clerk at the Thriftway in Montesano, Washington where Osborne was employed. Melvin was the most-hated fellow employee and the band felt it to be an appropriate name. Like SF noisenik predecessors Flipper, their love of slow tempos and sludgy sound were a strong influence on grunge music, especially Nirvana and many other bands from Seattle. Their protegés, however, tended to use more conventional musical structures with this sound.\r\n\r\nThough the group has received mostly positive critical notice, Crover\'s drumming has been especially praised; Patrick Kennedy describes his work as \"astonishing, powerful, and daring.\"\r\n\r\nWhile never finding and most likely never even seeking great mainstream success, the Melvins maintain an impressive schedule of new albums and tours, including a collaboration with Fantômas in The Fantômas Melvins Big Band, two releases with former Dead Kennedys frontman Jello Biafra, and in 2004 the Melvins collaborated with ambient artist Lustmord for Pigs of the Roman Empire. In appreciation of their devoted fans, the Melvins have released various collectables through the years that have included two-headed dolls, an eight-track tape, and a plastic fetus in a jar.\r\n\r\nFellow Aberdeen resident Kurt Cobain (a good friend of Crover) was a huge Melvins fan and helped them transport their equipment to a few shows. Cobain also auditioned to join the band on bass, but he didn\'t make it, reportedly because he was so nervous that he forgot all the songs. Cobain maintained his relation with the band. Later he produced and played on some songs (guitar on \"Sky Pup\", percussion on \"Spread Eagle Beagle\") on the band\'s major label debut, Houdini. Dale Crover is also attributed as playing on the Nirvana debut album, Bleach, and on \"Incesticide\". In addition, Dave Grohl (ex-drummer for Nirvana) co-wrote and played drums for Isabella on Buzzo\'s Melvins solo album, King Buzzo. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Melvins\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

A major part of the new wave scene, the band started out as Fred Schneider (vocals), Kate Pierson (vocals, organ), Cindy Wilson (vocals, bongos), Ricky Wilson (guitar), and Keith Strickland (drums). After Ricky Wilson died in 1985, Strickland replaced him as a guitarist. \r\n\r\nThe name comes from the bouffant wigs that are part of the band\'s distinctive look, worn by singers Cindy Wilson and Kate Pierson. Along with Wilson and Pierson, fellow vocalist Fred Schneider, drummer (and later guitarist) Keith Strickland, and guitarist Ricky Wilson (Cindy\'s older brother) formed the band after a drunken night at a Chinese restaurant. They shared a passion for mixing and matching older styles with a partying, good-time public image, which set them apart from many staid 70s contemporaries.\r\n\r\nTheir sound is particularly marked by the vocals of Wilson and Pierson, with Kate singing in a slightly deeper voice, along with the generally monotone or spoken-word vocals of Schneider. Aside from their vocals, the band also had a unique New Wave sound that was a combination of 50s and 60s dance music and surf rock, and the unusual guitar-string tunings utilized by Ricky Wilson. Although a clear part of said movement, their music was more experimental than most new wave groups, indulging in all manner of odd vocal and synthesizer effects.

Plummer has recently become the new drummer for The Shins.\r\n\r\nBrock came up with the name \"Modest Mouse\" when he read the Virginia Woolf stream of consciousness essay The Mark On the Wall in which the author described the working middle class as \"modest mouse-coloured people\"\r\n\r\nBrock frequently moved around with his mother when he was a child. Around this time, his mother left his father for his father\'s brother (Brock\'s uncle). Brock\'s mother\'s house flooded and forced them to move into his mother\'s new husband\'s trailer, but there was no room for Brock. Brock stayed behind, living in the second story of the flooded house, until he was eventually evicted by police. He then moved into a shed next to his mother\'s house and it is said this is where Brock, drummer Jeremiah Green and bassist Eric Judy first began playing music.\r\n\r\nIn 1994, the band recorded their debut EP, Blue Cadet-3, Do You Connect?, at Calvin Johnson\'s Dub Narcotic Studios, which was then released on Calvin\'s record label K Records. Then followed a single with Sub Pop that was recorded by producer Steve Wold at Moon Studios. Wold, who in the mid-2000\'s would begin to perform under the name Seasick Steve, would also perform on the band\'s albums, but was never an official member of the band.

The next offering on UP was Interstate 8; also produced by Steve Wold. 1997\'s The Lonesome Crowded West, (also recorded at Moon Studios, by Scott Swayze) turned out to be the band\'s breakthrough album. The Lonesome Crowded West gained the band a cult following and is now widely considered by many critics to be one of the defining albums of mid-90s indie rock.\r\n\r\nIn 2000, Modest Mouse released The Moon And Antarctica, their first album on a major label (Epic Records).

We took everything that we\'ve learned over the years and really put it into this place and into our music.” The property also houses the creative loft space that has become the official offices of the band’s own label Stoopid Records, which issued the band’s second album in 1999 Acoustic Roots, and has continued to be their preferred method of distributing the band’s recorded material.\r\n\r\nAnother key ingredient to what makes Slightly Stoopid extraordinarily special is the inclusion of several musical guests, both live and in the studio. \"It really keeps that \'family atmosphere\' for us,” says Doughty. “I think it really shows in the music — we live for the spirit of collaboration and on Top of The World we had G. Love, Angelo Moore from Fishbone, Don Carlos, Barrington Levy, Ian Neville from Dumpstaphunk, Tory Ruffin from Morris Day and the Time and Fishbone, and singer/songwriter Angela Hunte. Angelo Moore to me is one of the greatest front-men to ever step foot on a stage. As a fan and out of respect, I try to do something with Angelo every time we have a record, really. If you listen to his lyrics, his vocal performance—I don\'t know who could keep up with Angelo on stage. Don Carlos from Black Uhuru is one of the legendary reggae singers of all time and we\'ve had the pleasure of working with him the last few years. We\'ve been friends with G. Love for over 15 years, and we\'ve been able to work together quite a few different times in the studio. It seems like second nature. Whenever you\'re recording with G., it\'s almost like you\'re really just hanging out with your bro and you happen to hit record. We\'ve done so many shows together and so many studio sessions, it becomes second nature.“ <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Slightly+Stoopid\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

They were picked up by Vulture Hound, which called the group \"the epitome of modern Rock-n-roll.\"[3]\r\n\r\nIn 2014, Whitmore parted with founding members Ellis and Bell, the latter citing musical differences and leaving room for Jake Barnabas as drummer.[6] This change coincided with a change to a more electronically enhanced sound, described by Clash as \"all epic guitars and contagious synth lines\".[7]\r\n\r\nThe band were invited on tour with One Night Only in 2015 and so the band expanded, with guitarist Lewis Pusey joining January of that year. His first performance with the band was on set in London at the recording of The Believer music video.\r\n\r\nIn 2017 The Luka State started writing music for their debut album, which would become Fall In Fall Out, in their Winsford rehearsal space whilst touring extensively across the UK and internationally.\r\n\r\nThe band self-funded the recording of Fall In Fall Out at The Pool studio in London between October 2017 and August 2018 with producer Jamie Evans.

The two bands met through touring together, but those bands disbanded soon after, so John and Ken\'s pastor encouraged them to form their own band as a side-project. Coming from different styles of rock music, they decided to name the experiment Skillet. After Trey McClurkin joined the band as a permanent drummer. Skillet was only together for a month when they received interest from major Christian record label ForeFront Records. In 1996 they released a self-titled debut Skillet. It was well-received, and the trio continued to write new material as they toured the United States. One topic that comes up often among fans and the band itself, is the name \'Skillet\'. John Cooper, the lead vocalist, explains that it was a joke at first. Each starting band member was already in a separate band, and all decided to start a side project. Since each other band had a different sound and style to it, the side project was said to be like putting all of those styles in a big skillet to come up with something unique. Hence the band name \'Skillet\'. The band name is still somewhat of a joke between the band members, especially Cooper, who claims to still not like the title.\r\n\r\nSkillet recorded their follow-up album throughout 1997, titled Hey You, I Love Your Soul, which was released in April 1998. Their second effort was a change in style from the band\'s first release. With this release, Skillet would abandon their post-grunge approach for a lighter alternative rock. His wife Korey was enlisted soon after to play keyboards live in order to alleviate John\'s live performance duties.\r\n\r\nInvincible, Ardent Worship, and Alien Youth (2000–02)\r\nShortly before the band began recording for their third album, Invincible, Steorts left the band to be with his family, and Kevin Haaland joined the band as their new guitarist. Korey Cooper joined the band permanently and played keyboards for the recording of Invincible. Because of this change, the musical style on Invincible changed to a more electronic sound. Soon after the release of Invincible in early 2000, Trey McClurkin parted ways with Skillet, and Lori Peters filled the drummer\'s position. Invincible would be Skillet\'s best selling record to date.\r\n\r\nThe band released their first worship album, and fourth album overall, Ardent Worship in Fall 2000. The band kept much of their sound from Invincible on their next album Alien Youth. With little time between touring and recording, Skillet released Alien Youth on August 28, 2001, which was the first album that John Cooper took on production duties. Before the release of Alien Youth, Haaland left the band, and Ben Kasica took over on guitar. The first single, the title track, was a major hit in the Christian market and drove Skillet into their first headlining shows.\r\n\r\nCollide (2003–05)\r\nIn 2003, Collide was released by Ardent Records. It caught the attention of Andy Karp, the Head of A&R of Lava Records, and in 2004 the rights to Collide were bought by Lava Records, a division of Atlantic Records. On May 25, 2004, the album was re-released under Lava Records, with an added track, Open Wounds. Collide was yet another musical shift for the band. Citing Linkin Park and P.O.D. as inspiration for the musical shift on Collide, Cooper said, \"Well I’m one of these song writers, everything I hear goes through my John Cooper filter of what I like and what I don’t like. [...] All these things [...] have been an influence on me.\'\r\n\r\nComatose (2006–08)\r\nSkillet\'s album Comatose was released on October 3, 2006. It features the singles Rebirthing, Whispers in the Dark, Comatose, The Older I Get, Those Nights and The Last Night. The album debuted at #55 on the Billboard 200 and #4 on the US Top Christian Albums chart. In January 2008, Skillet announced that their drummer, Lori Peters, was retiring from the band, feeling that \"it\'s time for her to come off of the road and start a new chapter in her life.\" Peters\' last concert with Skillet was on December 31, 2007. However, during the 2007 Christmas season, she took the time to train Skillet\'s next drummer, Jen Ledger.\r\nOn October 21, 2008, Comatose Comes Alive was released; a CD/DVD combo featuring live recordings of the band\'s May 9, 2008 concert in Chattanooga, Tennessee. It was shown on the Gospel Music Channel on December 5, 2008 and it also had a B-side with Live Free or Let Me Die as a single, also with five acoustic tracks which purchasers could download by putting the Comatose Comes Alive CD in their computer. The Comatose album was certified Gold in sales by the RIAA on November 3, 2009.\r\n\r\nAwake (2009–2011)\r\nSkillet announced that they went into the studio January 12 to finalize the new record with Grammy-nominated producer Howard Benson. They added two songs (Hero and Monster) from the new record to their setlist on April 2, 2009 in Evansville, Indiana as part of their Comatose Tour 2009.\r\n\r\nAwake was released with twelve songs on August 25, 2009. It charted at #2 on the Billboard top 200 selling around 68,000 units in its first week. Monster was released as a single on July 14, 2009.

It was, however, released as a single in March 2010.They also released a deluxe version with the extra songs \"Dead Inside\" and \"Would It Matter\", along with the original, radio edit of \"Monster\" that does not have the distorted growl as in the single and in the CD.

At a question and answer session before a concert, John Cooper said that they would be recording a new record in January/February 2012. However, the band was then scheduled to headline the WinterJam Tour. In January 2012, Skillet announced that they will not be touring for most of the summer so that they can record the new album. They plan to enter the studio at the conclusion of the Winter Jam eastern tour, approximately in May, for a release in late 2012.\r\n\r\nDuring a July 18, 2012 interview with RadioU, John Cooper stated the band currently had 61 songs written and would be heading into the studio in October to record the album with Howard Benson for an early 2013 release.\r\n\r\nIn an interview with CCM Magazine, John Cooper described the new album as \"a roller coaster ride\". He states: \"We have aggressive tracks, artsy and musical tracks, which is new territory for Skillet. A couple songs are classic American heartland anthems, and a couple songs are signature symphonic-classical rock Skillet. Guitars are dirty and edgier, with absolute shredding solos by Seth.\" One of the songs mentioned in the interview was titled \"Salvation\".\r\n\r\nIn an Interview on January 26, 2013 In Beaumont TX, John Cooper announced that the new album, Rise, would be coming out in May 2013, but was later scheduled for a June 25, 2013 release. In an interview with NoiseCreep, John Cooper stated the first single and music video is scheduled to be released by late April.

Her mother studied piano with a specialty in musical pedagogy and is the creator of the Macarsi Method for musical training and personal development for children and educators. She adapted and practiced the method with Natalia to help her rehabilitate through music following a head injury from being kicked by a horse.  \r\n\r\nWhen she was 17, Loris Ceroni gave Lafourcade the opportunity to be in a pop/rock group under his guidance. Lafourcade was hesitant, and Ceroni instead encouraged her to become independent. Lafourcade produced her first LP under the label of Sony Music. It was recorded in Italy and was cowritten with Aureo Baqueiro. Sabo Romo played in 2 songs. Natalia Lafourcade is a mix of pop, rock, bossa-nova and Latin rhythms. It features the songs \"Busca Un Problema\", \"Elefantes\", \"Te Quiero Dar\", \"Mírame, Mírate\", and her biggest hit, \"En El 2000\". \r\n\r\nIn 2005, she released Casa, her second album, but this time as Natalia y La Forquetina, the name of her band. Produced mostly by Café Tacuba\'s Emmanuel del Real, Casa presents a more mature, rock-oriented sound while retaining pop and bossa-nova influences on a few tracks, such as lead single \"Ser Humano\" (pop-rock) and its follow-up \"Casa\" (pop-bossa-nova). Aureo Baqueiro returned to produce the few tracks not produced by del Real.  More than a year after Natalia departed from La Forquetina, she recorded an instrumental album called The 4 Seasons of Love under Sony BMG label. She also wrote the Lyrics for \"Tú y Yo\" from Ximena Sariñana\'s self-titled album. \r\n\r\nIn 2009, she released the album Hu Hu Hu, a top 10 album in Mexico. The album was produced by Emmanuel del Real (who produced \"Casa\" in 2005), Marco Moreno and Ernesto García. It was nominated for Best female Pop Vocal Album at the 2009 Latin Grammy Awards (won by Laura Pausini) and Best Latin Pop album at the 2010 Grammy Awards (won by La Quinta Estación). Club Fonograma also named the album the second best of 2009, and the seventh best of the decade.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, she released a tribute album to Agustín Lara called Mujer Divina.\r\n\r\nHer next album, Hasta La Raíz, was released in March 2015. \"Nunca Es Suficiente\" (It\'s Never Enough), the first single off the album, was released on 10 February. The track \"Hasta La Raíz\" was No. 5 of the Viral 50 Global Spotify Chart and the No. 1 on the Viral 50 México chart.\r\n\r\nIn 2017, she recorded \"Remember Me\" as a duet with contemporary R&B singer Miguel for the credits of the movie Coco, and together they also performed the song at the 90th Academy Awards ceremony.\r\n\r\n2020 saw her release the eponymous Un Canto por México, Vol. 1.\r\n\r\nIn 2023, She won a Grammy for her album \" Un Canto Por México - El Musical\" <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Natalia+Lafourcade\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Jones is a project from American singer, guitarist, and songwriter Jonathon Linaberry (born in central New York State in 1982).\r\n\r\nJ.R. is said to have started dabbling in music when he was six and his mother mandated – as she did with his older and younger brothers – that he take piano lessons. A self-taught guitar and banjo player, J.R.’s fondness for old gospel hymns, bluesmen like Son House and R.L. Burnside, and artists like The Carter Family and Tom Waits, helped shape his sound, which has been described as “haunting stomp blues tempered with a touch of honey.”\r\n\r\nGrowing up the middle of three brothers, J.R.’s childhood developed in him a strong sense of home and yearning to return to it – despite being shot in the back by his blood brother with a BB gun – the pellet is still nestled comfortably behind his ribs to this day.\r\n\r\nJ.R. pulls from a constellation of sensory experiences “the smell of being in an apple orchard first thing in the morning, the sound of boots on old wood floorboards, the feeling of falling asleep to the hum of a fan in the summer, early autumn in the country” that inspire and inform his music.\r\n\r\nWith a musical style that adeptly toes the line between folky and sorrowful lullabies to dirty, grainy, blues-influenced songs, J.R.’s voice communicates a level of intimacy and passion that carries with it a quiet sense of loss, yearning, and wanting.\r\n\r\nPerforming on stage with a kick drum, high-hat, and guitar/banjo (as well as the occasional harmonica and kazoo) J.R.’s live shows are visually impressive – a powerful and dynamic display that showcases his musical and emotional range.\r\n\r\nHis songs speak of sorrow and hope, a longing for home, and, he says, “The more unsavory desires and wants in your life – those demons and devils that haunt you.” *\r\n\r\n*taken from his website, The-Wildness.com. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Bones+of+J.R.+Jones\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The band consists of Charlie Scene, Danny, Funny Man, J-Dog, and Johnny 3 Tears. The band members use pseudonyms and wear masks to display a creative side, not to hide their identities as first assumed. They perform live without the masks on.\r\n\r\nThe band originated in 2005 from a song titled \"The Kids\" that Aron Erlichman (Deuce) and Jorel Decker (J-Dog) posted on the band\'s MySpace profile to positive reviews, leading them to form the group Hollywood Undead with their friends \"Shady\" Jeff Philips, George Ragan (Johnny 3 Tears), Jordon Terrell (Charlie Scene), Dylan Alvarez (Funny Man), and Matthew St. Claire (Da Kurlzz). In an interview with Shave magazine, J-Dog explained that when forming the band \"Whoever was in the room at the time and played an instrument was in the band.\"\r\n\r\nThe band only took one year working on their debut album, Swan Songs. The other two years were spent looking for a company that wouldn\'t try to censor the album. They first signed a record contract with MySpace Records in 2005 but they left the label after the label tried to censor their first album. They then signed a contract with A&M/Octone Records and their first album, Swan Songs was released on September 2, 2008 and reached #22 on the Billboard 200 in its first week of release, selling 21,000 copies; which was later on released in the United Kingdom on May 18, 2009 with two bonus tracks. On June 23, 2009, Hollywood Undead released Swan Songs B-Sides EP through iTunes. After 64 weeks, the album fell off of the Billboard Top 200, but returned four weeks later at #174. Since then, it has gone in and out of the top 200, and is currently charting at #199.

Ragan and Busek later cited arguments over writing credits, and Deuce not wanting to tour, as reasons for the departure. Decker and Terrell also stated that Deuce wanting to bring his own personal assistant for touring caused a rift between members. The band asked long-time friend, and lead singer of Lorene Drive, Daniel Murillo, to fill in for Deuce\'s role. Murillo had just advanced past the auditions for season 9 of American Idol, but decided to drop out to join the band.\r\n\r\nThe band soon began writing material for their second studio album; American Tragedy, in mid-2010, with hopes to release it by the end of the year.

The band was formed in 2009 by brothers Sam and Casey Harris, and childhood friend Noah Feldshuh. Initially, the group started out playing local gigs and self-releasing music, but their unique sound soon caught the attention of record labels.\r\n\r\nThe band\'s music is an eclectic mix of genres, including alternative rock, indie rock, and pop. They are known for their energetic and emotional live performances, which are often accompanied by elaborate visuals and lighting.\r\n\r\nX Ambassadors\' breakthrough came with the release of their debut album, \"VHS,\" in 2015. The album spawned several hit singles, including \"Renegades,\" \"Unsteady,\" and \"Jungle,\" which have collectively amassed over a billion streams on Spotify alone. \"VHS\" also featured collaborations with other artists, including Imagine Dragons and Jamie N Commons.\r\n\r\nOne of the band\'s defining characteristics is their willingness to address personal and social issues through their music. For instance, \"Unsteady\" is a poignant reflection on the Harris brothers\' upbringing with a mother who battled substance abuse, while \"Renegades\" is a call for rebellion against societal norms.\r\n\r\nX Ambassadors have also been vocal advocates for mental health awareness and have worked with organizations like the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention and the JED Foundation. In 2019, they launched their own initiative, the \"Joyful Tour,\" which aimed to destigmatize mental health issues and promote self-care among fans.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their studio albums, X Ambassadors have released several EPs and singles over the years, showcasing their versatility as a band. They have also collaborated with other artists on various projects, including the soundtrack for the Netflix film \"Bright\" and the song \"Home\" with Machine Gun Kelly and Bebe Rexha. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/X+Ambassadors\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The best known and internationally most succesful rock band to come out of the Netherlands (The Hague, to be precise), they had 47 chart hits in their home country. Outside of The Netherlands they are best known for their brace of North American hits, Radar Love (1973, a U.S. hit in 1974) and Twilight Zone (1982, a U.S. hit in 1983). \r\n\r\nFormed in 1961, the band was active for 60 years, almost non-stop. They had 56 years of studio output, starting in 1965, which made them the world\'s longest surviving rock band, formed a year before The Rolling Stones, until their tragic end on 5 February 2021, when guitarist founding member George Kooymans revealed that he had been diagnosed with the neuro-muscular disease, ALS. \r\n\r\nThe band\'s core line-up of four was unchanged from 1970 to 2021, although additional musicians had short stints in the band in the 1970s. Golden Earring was always touring, except in 2000 (their only sabbatical year) and the final year of their existence, due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\r\n\r\nIn 1961 George Kooymans (age 13) and his neighbour Rinus Gerritsen (age 15) formed The Tornado\'s in the Zuiderpark district of their home town of The Hague, The Netherlands. The band\'s first line-up mainly played The Shadows and The Ventures covers, as well as other instrumental tunes, and played its first gigs at school parties.\r\n\r\nIn 1963, as the band found out that there already was a British band called The Tornados, they decided to change their name into The Golden Ear-rings (after a Peggy Lee song). The band now performed around The Hague, soon had a devoted local following and landed a record deal with Polydor. Their debut single, 1965\'s Please Go, immediately landed in the Dutch Top 10. \r\n\r\nUnder the Golden Earrings moniker the band eventually recorded four albums and had twelve hit singles in the Netherlands between 1965 and 1969, ten of which reached the Dutch Top 10. Several of their records were released internationally in Europe and even North America, although they failed to make an impact there.\r\n\r\nOne of the band\'s sixties singles became  their first Dutch #1 hit: 1968\'s somewhat carnavalesque Dong-Dong-Diki-Digi-Dong, although that tune is now frowned upon by the band and generally regarded as inferior to other sixties Earrings gems, such as That Day (1966, the first Dutch pop single to have been recorded in the U.K., at London\'s Pye Studios), Sound Of The Screaming Day (1966) and the epic Just A Little Bit Of Peace In My Heart (1969).\r\n\r\nThe band\'s lead singer during the early Golden Earrings years was Frans Krassenburg. He was replaced by Barry Hay (ex-The Haigs) in 1967. The band\'s drummer for much of the 1960s was Jaap Eggermont. His successors were Sieb Warner (1969) and, in 1970, Cesar Zuiderwijk (ex-Livin\' Blues), Golden Earring\'s definitive drummer. \r\n\r\nThe band\'s international career modestly started to take off in 1969, the year of their psychedelic Eight Miles High album, their first haphazard tour of the United States and also the year in which the band name was slightly changed into The Golden Earring and finally (dropping the article within a year), Golden Earring. On their early U.S. tours, their long, wild cover version of The Byrds\' classic Eight Miles High impressed audiences and press alike. Golden Earring\'s 19-minute album version, as well as the stand-alone 1969 single, Another 45 Miles, were the first Golden Earring recordings to get some North American airplay.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of drummer, Cesar Zuiderwijk, in 1970, completed what would turn out to be the group\'s definitive line-up: Barry Hay (lead vocals/guitar/flute), George Kooymans (guitar/vocals), Cesar Zuiderwijk (drums) and Rinus Gerritsen (bass/harmonica/keyboards).\r\n\r\n1970 saw a dramatic shift in Golden Earring\'s musical style. After the melodic, often Beatle-esque sixties beat of The Golden Earrings and a brief phase of psychedelia and hippie rock in 1968 and 1969, the single Back Home marked the birth of Golden Earring\'s trademark heavy, riff-based brand of hard rock with catchy hooks. Back Home hit #1 in the Dutch charts and \'broke\' Golden Earring in most of Europe, notably countries such as Germany, Switzerland, Austria and France.\r\n\r\nThis marked the start of a decade of domestic and international glory. Between 1966 and 1976 seventeen consecutive Earring singles rocketed into the Dutch Top 10, while their international popularity increased, especially after their lengthy 1972 tour of Europe, supporting The Who. Buddy Joe (1972) achieved considerable chart success in the German-speaking countries of Europe, but 1973\'s Radar Love was their breakthrough smash hit worldwide: #13 in the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, #1 in the U.S. Cashbox chart, #5 in Britain, #8 in Australia, #10 in Canada, #5 in Germany, #6 in Belgium, #1 in Spain and also #1 in (last but not least) Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), to name but a few.\r\n\r\nRadar Love remains an enduring \'car classic\' and radio anthem of global fame to this day. Between 1969 and 1985 Golden Earring completed ten major tours of North America, building a considerable North American fanbase, as well as five headlining tours of Great Britain in 1973 and 1974 alone. Golden Earring toured as \'special guests\' of The Who, Aerosmith, Led Zeppelin, .38 Special, Rush and many more, whereas bands like Aerosmith, KISS, ZZ Top and Lynyrd Skynyrd opened for Golden Earring. The album that spawned Radar Love, 1973\'s Moontan, was certified \'Gold\' by North America\'s RIAA in 1974 and sold millions of copies worldwide.\r\n\r\nThe band failed to achieve similar chart success in the years after Radar Love: the progressive Switch (1975) and To The Hilt (1976) charted in Billboard\'s album charts, but yielded no major U.S. hits. The singles were clearly not what North American audiences wanted from the \'Radar Love guys\'.\r\n\r\nGolden Earring was forgotten by many outside of The Netherlands and by 1980 even Dutch audiences started to lose interest: albums such as No Promises, No Debts (1979) and Prisoner Of The Night (1980) were commercial flops, leading to the band\'s decision (in 1981) to record a \'final LP and then call it quits. \r\n\r\nThe lead single from 1982\'s \'farewell album\', Cut, a Kooymans-penned tune called Twilight Zone, surprisingly became an even bigger hit in the U.S. than Radar Love: #10 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #1 on Billboard\'s Mainstream Rock Tracks, thanks to heavy MTV rotation of the Dick Maas-directed video. The song (#1 in The Netherlands) revived Golden Earring\'s stateside career overnight. The Cut LP was certified \'gold\' in Canada, with Twilight Zone hitting #3 in the Canadian charts.\r\n\r\nIn their native Netherlands the band managed to extend their creative and commercial peak this time: the single When The Lady Smiles and the album N.E.W.S. (\'NorthEastWestSouth\'), both released in 1984, repeated the success of Twilight Zone and Cut. \'Lady\' peaked at #3 in Canada, but fared disappointingly in the U.S. as MTV and even radio stations banned the track because of its controversial video, once again directed by Dick Maas, in which the rape of a nun was suggested. \r\n\r\nAfter 1985 things rapidly went downhill for Golden Earring internationally (they would not tour the U.S. again), but - after a creative and financial crisis that lasted throughout the second half of the 1980s - the band wrote one of their most enduring Dutch hits in 1991 (the power-ballad, Going To The Run, which fared particularly well in Russia) and discovered a new gold mine in their home country a year later: acoustic concerts in theatres, the concept of MTV Unplugged. \r\n\r\nTo everybody\'s surprise, the band\'s acoustic live album, The Naked Truth, slowly became their all-time biggest selling album in The Netherlands. Its sequels, Naked II (1997) and Naked III (2005) also went platinum at least once in The Netherlands.\r\n\r\nGolden Earring\'s by far most succesful album internationally remains 1973\'s Moontan, which sold well over 3.5 million copies outside of The Netherlands and was certified \'gold\' in the U.S., Canada and the United Kingdom (and platinum in the U.S. in later years).\r\n\r\nGolden Earring released 25 studio albums, 9 live albums and countless succesful compilations. Almost all of these records were certified gold, often platinum, in The Netherlands. More than anything else, though, the band remained a live force of legendary status in their home country and beyond. They toured throughout each year until the very end, almost exclusively in the Netherlands, although there are still occasional live appearances in Belgium and Germany. 2009 saw Golden Earring\'s long overdue return to the United Kingdom: their sold out shows in Ipswich and London\'s Shepherd\'s Bush Empire were their first live appearances in England since 1978.\r\n\r\nIn 2011 the band recorded their first album of new material since 2003\'s Millbrook U.S.A.: Tits \'n Ass - studio album #25 for the Dutch legends - was released on 11 May 2012 on Universal Music and hit #1 in the Dutch album charts one week after its release to become Golden Earring\'s 8th #1 album in their home country.

After a year of Covid-19 lockdowns, guitarist George Kooymans announced his ALS diagnosis on 5 February 2021, the disease rendering him unfit to perform. Within hours, the band admitted that carrying on without Kooymans was unthinkable. In the words of lead singer, Barry Hay: \"This is the end of the line for the band. It\'s a death blow.

Their current lineup consists of guitarists Gary Holt and Lee Altus, bassist Jack Gibson, drummer Tom Hunting, and lead vocalist Steve \"Zetro\" Souza. There are no original members left in Exodus other than Hunting, who has departed from the band twice, in 1989 and 2004, but rejoined in 2007. Exodus is also notable for its inclusion of guitarist Kirk Hammett in its initial lineup; he eventually left the band in 1983 to join Metallica as Dave Mustaine\'s replacement. Holt, who replaced original guitarist Tim Agnello in 1981, has been most consistent member throughout various lineup changes and break-ups, and is the only member to appear on all of Exodus\' recordings. Much of the band\'s career has also been affected by bitter feuds between both band members and record companies, two extended hiatuses, deaths of former band members and internal problems often relating to drugs.\r\n\r\nSince its formation, Exodus has released eleven studio albums, two live albums, one compilation album, and a re-recording of their first album. Along with Metallica, they are often credited as pioneers of the Bay Area thrash metal scene, and have been referred to as one of the region\'s so-called \"big six\" alongside Testament, Death Angel, Lååz Rockit, Forbidden and Vio-lence. Exodus have sold over five million albums worldwide, and they are also considered to be one of the \"big eight\" of thrash metal, along with Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, Anthrax, Testament, Overkill and Death Angel. The band had particular success in the mid-to-late 1980s with their first three studio albums: Bonded by Blood (1985), Pleasures of the Flesh (1987) and Fabulous Disaster (1989). The critical praise given to Fabulous Disaster garnered attention from major labels, including Capitol Records, with whom Exodus signed in 1989 and released two albums for the label: Impact Is Imminent (1990) and Force of Habit (1992). After a break up in 1993 and a short-lived reunion in 1997–1998, Exodus reunited once again in 2001, and since then, they have released six more studio albums, starting with and including Tempo of the Damned (2004), which reignited Exodus\' popularity and is considered to be a key part in the early-to-mid-2000s thrash metal revival movement. The band\'s eleventh and latest studio album, Persona Non Grata, was released on November 19, 2021.\r\n\r\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exodus_(band)\r\n\r\nStudio albums\r\nBonded by Blood (1985)\r\nPleasures of the Flesh (1987)\r\nFabulous Disaster (1989)\r\nImpact Is Imminent (1990)\r\nForce of Habit (1992)\r\nTempo of the Damned (2004)\r\nShovel Headed Kill Machine (2005)\r\nThe Atrocity Exhibition...

The band has gone through a number of personnel changes but has remained centered on Jakob Dylan. The Wallflowers have won two Grammy Awards and have released seven albums:\r\n\r\nThe Wallflowers (1992)Bringing Down The Horse (1996)Breach (2000) Red Letter Days (2002)Rebel, Sweetheart (2005)Glad All Over (2012)Exit Wounds (2021)  \r\n\r\nOn April 9th, 2021, The Wallflowers (now continuing as a Jakob Dylan solo project) announced their seventh studio album, Exit Wounds, would be released in July 2021.  \r\n\r\nThe band is widely known for their hit singles \"One Headlight\", \"6th Avenue Heartache\", \"Three Marlenas\" and \"The Difference\".  \r\n \r\n\r\n1988–1990: Early history\r\nThe Wallflowers\' inception came in 1988/1989 when singer-guitarist Jakob Dylan called his childhood friend, Tobi Miller, also a guitarist, about starting a band. Dylan and Miller had been in several bands together in high school but went their separate ways upon graduation. Dylan had moved to New York City to go to art school while Miller had started his own band called the 45\'s. After the 45\'s broke up in 1989, Miller regained contact with Dylan and they began forming a new band called the Apples. Barrie Maguire, who was in the 45\'s with Miller, joined the band as their bass player. In 1990, Peter Yanowitz was added as the drummer. The final member to join the group was keyboardist Rami Jaffee. Jaffee was an active member of the Los Angeles music scene and had been playing with multiple bands in the area. He met Dylan in 1990 in the Kibitz Room, a bar located in the back of Canter\'s; a Jewish deli located on Fairfax Avenue in Los Angeles. He had heard the Apples were looking for an organ player and after meeting and talking with Dylan in the Kibitz Room, the two headed for Dylan\'s car to listen to the band\'s demo tape. Jaffee was impressed by the songs and asked to join in on the band\'s next rehearsal. After a long rehearsal session, Jaffee joined the band on the spot.\r\n\r\n1991–1994: Debut album\r\nThe Apples changed their name to the Wallflowers and began playing clubs around Los Angeles, specifically the Sunset Strip, such as the Whisky a Go Go, Gazzarri\'s and the Viper Room. While they were playing clubs the band was also sending their demo tape to record companies and figures within the music industry. One of those tapes caught the attention of Andrew Slater, who would eventually become the Wallflowers\' manager.  Slater brought the Wallflowers to Virgin Records, who signed the band to a record contract. The Wallflowers then set out to make their first album. However, finding a producer who was willing to work with them proved to be difficult. The band was intent on recording live and few producers were willing to produce that way. Paul Fox eventually stepped in and agreed to produce the album. By the time the Wallflowers got into the studio in 1991, they had a small catalog of songs they had been performing live which they wanted to record for their debut album. All of the songs were written by Dylan with the rest of the band members contributing input on the music. When in the studio, the band were intent on using as little recording equipment as possible. Dylan explained: \"If I could have had it my way I would not have seen a microphone or a cable anywhere.\"  When it came to recording, the songs were drawn out past the 3 to 4 minute norm; many songs were close to 5 minutes in length with two exceeding 7 minutes. The Wallflowers finished recording and released their self-titled debut album, \"The Wallflowers\", on August 25, 1992.  After the release they began touring nationwide as an opening act for bands such as Spin Doctors and 10,000 Maniacs.\r\n\r\nThe Wallflowers continued to tour through the first half of 1993 but despite this sales of the album were slow. In total, 40,000 copies were sold.[8] Reviews for the album, however, were mostly positive. Rolling Stone gave the album 4 stars calling it, \"one sweet debut\" and describing Dylan\'s songwriting as \"impressive.\"  Great reviews notwithstanding, executives at Virgin Records were reportedly not pleased with the album\'s lack of commercial success. Around this time, the company was going through a shift in management which led to the removal of Jeff Ayeroff and Jordan Harris, the two people who initially brought the Wallflowers to Virgin. After Ayeroff and Harris left the company the Wallflowers began to feel that they had no future with Virgin and asked to be released from their contract. The split with Virgin has been regarded as mutual. By mid-1993 the Wallflowers were without a record label.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Virgin, the Wallflowers went back to playing Los Angeles clubs in hopes of getting signed with another label. The band found it difficult to even get label representatives to come to their shows. In the year it took to get another record deal the Wallflowers gained and lost several band members. Bass player Barrie Maguire was asked to leave for undisclosed reasons in early 1993. The Wallflowers continued playing shows with replacement bass player Jimmie Snider until May 1993 when the band hired Greg Richling. Dylan and Richling went to high school together. The Wallflowers continued to play club shows in Los Angeles through early 1994 when drummer Peter Yanowitz left the band to join his girlfriend Natalie Merchant\'s band. Yanowitz brought in Barrie Maguire to help record Merchant\'s debut solo album, Tigerlily. Around the time of Yanowitz\'s departure the Wallflowers caught the attention of Jimmy Iovine and Tom Whalley of Interscope Records, who then signed the band to their label in 1994.\r\n\r\n1995–1998: Bringing Down the Horse\r\nAfter signing with Interscope Records, the Wallflowers began preparations for their second album, Bringing Down The Horse. They again had trouble finding a producer that was willing to work with them. The Wallflowers began sending demo tapes to producers and one of the tapes landed in the hands of T Bone Burnett. Burnett was impressed by the songs and agreed to produce the band.  However, just as they were getting ready to record, the band\'s guitarist Tobi Miller quit. This left the Wallflowers without a permanent drummer or guitarist while they were in the studio. Matt Chamberlain filled in on drums throughout the recording sessions and several guitarists were brought in to fill Miller\'s role including Mike Campbell, Fred Tackett, Jay Joyce and Michael Ward, who would go on to become a permanent member of the Wallflowers.\r\n\r\nThe Wallflowers released Bringing Down the Horse on May 21, 1996.  The band began touring for the album soon after the release.  Album sales were slow to start but after the first single, \"6th Avenue Heartache\" (featuring Adam Duritz of Counting Crows) was released on August 19, interest in the Wallflowers began picking up as the song began getting more radio play. The David Fincher-directed music video for \"6th Avenue Heartache\" was also receiving attention on MTV and VH1. The Wallflowers continued to tour through the rest of 1996 and were featured as a musical guest on Saturday Night Live that November. On December 1, Bringing Down The Horse received Gold certification from the RIAA by selling 500,000 copies of their album.\r\n\r\nIn January 1997, the Wallflowers were nominated for two Grammy awards, both for \"6th Avenue Heartache\".  Dylan was a presenter at the 1997 Grammy Awards though he and the Wallflowers did not win either of the awards they were nominated for.\r\n\r\nThe band continued to tour and gain popularity. In February 1997, the Wallflowers completed a tour opening for Sheryl Crow before beginning a string of their own headlining shows beginning at the end of February and running through May. On February 24, the second single from Bringing Down The Horse, \"One Headlight\", was released. It received heavy radio play, which propelled Bringing Down The Horse to Platinum certification on March 4 by selling one million copies of the album. Within six weeks, sales for the record doubled and on April 16, the album received Double-Platinum status by selling two million copies. In mid-May, the Wallflowers crossed over to Europe for a three-week-long tour. Upon return in mid-June, the Wallflowers continued to tour the United States. On June 12, Dylan received his first Rolling Stone magazine cover.  In the accompanying interview, Dylan spoke both candidly and at length about his lineage for the first time. Five days later, album sales for Bringing Down The Horse reached the three million mark, qualifying the album for Triple-Platinum status. On June 21, the Wallflowers co-headlined a festival at Texas Motor Speedway called Rock Fest. The day-long festival drew upwards of 400,000 people, making it one of the largest concerts in US history.\r\n\r\nOn July 2, 1997, the Wallflowers kicked off a co-headlining tour with Counting Crows that continued through September. This tour included opening acts by Bettie Serveert, Engine 88, Gigolo Aunts, and That Dog, with each opening band touring for a three-week stretch.[23] The Wallflowers took over full-headlining duties for several shows in July when Counting Crows were unable to perform due to Duritz\'s swollen vocal chords.[24] On September 22, the Wallflowers released their third single from Bringing Down the Horse, \"The Difference\". On October 30, the album hit another milestone by receiving Quadruple-Platinum status by selling four million copies. After taking the month of October off from touring, the Wallflowers hit the road again in November. On November 9 and 10, the Wallflowers broke from their headlining tour to open for the The Rolling Stones at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles. Less than a week later, the Wallflowers again broke from their tour to co-headline a private show at an arena in San Jose, California with Bob Dylan on November 14. The Wallflowers continued to tour through the end of December. By the end of 1997, the album had become the most played record on rock radio and peaked at Number 4 on the Billboard 200 while \"One Headlight\" had received some 209,000 radio spins across all formats.\r\n\r\nOn January 6, 1998, the Wallflowers received three Grammy nominations; \"One Headlight\" and \"The Difference\" were both nominated for Best Rock Song while \"One Headlight\" received an additional nomination for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. At the 1998 Grammy Award ceremony on February 25, the Wallflowers walked away with two Grammy Awards; \"One Headlight\" won for Best Rock Song as well as Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal.\r\n\r\n Despite the fact that Bringing Down The Horse was released nearly two years previously, the Wallflowers released an additional single from the album on March 23, \"Three Marlenas\".  It would be the fourth and final single to be released from the album. By 1998 the Wallflowers had begun declining on the Billboard charts and receiving fewer spins on the radio. That changed, however, when the soundtrack for the 1998 film Godzilla was released on May 19. The Wallflowers had recorded a version of David Bowie\'s song \"Heroes\", which was chosen as the lead single for the soundtrack. The album peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 and the Wallflowers\' version of \"Heroes\" received heavy radio play. Though the Wallflowers did not tour in 1998 they did play a series of one-off shows including the Tibetan Freedom Concert in June at RFK Stadium in Washington, D.C. and the Bridge School Benefit in September in Mountain View, California, which was hosted by Neil Young and his wife Pegi.\r\n\r\n1999–2001: (Breach)\r\nAfter taking a five-month break from writing and touring, the Wallflowers set out to make their third album, (Breach). Dylan was very diligent in the songwriting process; he rented a studio near his home and would routinely go there to write songs for the album. However, Dylan was not satisfied with the first batch of songs he came up with. He decided to scrap them and start over. The songs that did make it to the studio were considered to be far more personal than any of the songs the Wallflowers had released in the past. Dylan explained; \"I think all my songs are personal, but I just made them a little more dense before, made \'em real thick so that I didn\'t feel exposed. A lot of younger writers do that. Before, I haven\'t really wanted anybody buying my records looking for information about myself or my family, but at this point, the group has a lot of people buying the records who aren\'t interested in that, so it gives me more freedom.\" \r\n\r\nBy the end of 1999, the Wallflowers were ready to begin recording. The bulk of the album was recorded at Sunset Sound Recorders in Los Angeles. The Wallflowers\' longtime manager, Andrew Slater co-produced the album with Michael Penn. The band took their time in the studio. Like Bringing Down the Horse, Breach took about eight months to record. It featured an array of guest artists including Elvis Costello, Mike Campbell and Frank Black.\r\n\r\nFour years after the release of Bringing Down The Horse in 1996, Breach was released on October 10, 2000. The album was met with generally positive critical reception but underwhelming sales. Rolling Stone gave Breach four stars, calling the band \"more muscular\" than they used to be. However, the album commercially floundered in comparison to its high-selling predecessor. The album peaked at No. 13 on the Billboard 200 and took almost a year to receive the Gold certification, which is the highest certification it has received to date.\r\n\r\nA month before the official release of Breach, the album was leaked in its entirety to file-sharing giant, Napster, where a reported 25 million users had the ability to listen to and download the Wallflowers\' third album. With regard to the impact of leaks for big recording artists, former Capitol Records senior vice president and general manager, Lou Mann stated: \"For the Wallflowers or any major superstar band, the problems are major. In fact they\'re Herculean, because people already want it and you don\'t want to dilute your audience.\" Jakob Dylan also explained his feelings about (Breach) being leaked: \" one of the ways that we have of making a living really. It\'s not about record companies, it\'s not about people\'s right to trade, you know, it\'s also how we put food on the table.\"\r\n\r\nDespite the disappointing release, the Wallflowers set out on another tour beginning in early October 2000. After one show in Atlanta on October 2, the Wallflowers traveled to New York to open for the Who for four nights at Madison Square Garden. Later that month, [arist]Jakob Dylan was featured on the cover of Rolling Stone for a second time. The Wallflowers continued to tour throughout the U.S. through mid-December before heading to Japan in February 2001 for their first tour there.\r\n\r\nIn between album cycles The Wallflowers covered the Bee Gees\' 1968 hit song \"I Started a Joke\" for the 2001 film, Zoolander.\r\n\r\nThe band continued to tour the U.S. for the remainder of 2001 until it was announced in early October that guitarist, Michael Ward, had left the Wallflowers due to creative differences.[42]\r\n\r\n2002–2003: Red Letter Days\r\nIn 2001, Jakob Dylan began writing for the Wallflowers\' fourth album, Red Letter Days. Later that year while on tour with John Mellencamp, the band began recording using portable equipment. Some recording was also done at keyboardist Rami Jaffee\'s house. Once the band was finished touring for the year they began recording the bulk of the new record at Jackson Browne\'s studio in Santa Monica. By the time the Wallflowers had gotten into Browne\'s studio, Michael Ward had left the band, leaving them without a lead guitarist for the recording process. Dylan took on much of the lead guitar duties with Mike McCready, Rusty Anderson and Val McCallum also contributing on guitar. Moe Z M.D., who had been touring with Mellencamp, contributed additional percussion and background vocals to the album. Red Letter Days was produced by founding Wallflowers member Tobi Miller along with Bill Appleberry. Recording continued through the new year and was completed on April 12, 2002. The album was mixed by Tom Lord-Alge, who had mixed the band\'s previous two albums. Mixing was completed on May 15, 2002.\r\n\r\nWhile the Wallflowers were working on Red Letter Days, they recorded a cover of the Beatles\' 1965 song \"I\'m Looking Through You\" for the soundtrack to the 2001 film I Am Sam. The soundtrack was released on January 8, 2002.\r\n\r\nThe first single from the Red Letter Days, \"When You’re On Top,\" was released to radio on August 16, 2002. A music video directed by Marc Webb followed. After a few false starts, Red Letter Days was released on November 5, 2002. The album was met with mixed to positive reviews. Many critics noted the harder rock sound and catchy melodies used throughout the album. Commercial performance was relatively mixed as well, peaking at No.32 on the Billboard 200. Around the time of the Red Letter Days release the Wallflowers embarked on a monthlong U.S. tour stretching into early December. After another U.S. tour in January 2003, the Wallflowers toured in several European countries in February including Spain, Italy, Germany and Great Britain. After this tour, the Wallflowers\' drummer since 1995, Mario Calire announced he was parting ways with the band.\r\n\r\nIn 2003, the Wallflowers were featured on the soundtrack for the film American Wedding. The band recorded a cover of Van Morrison\'s 1970 song \"Into the Mystic\". The film\'s music department weren\'t able to secure the licensing rights to use Morrison\'s version so they enlisted the Wallflowers to cover the song. Both versions of the song were, however, featured in the film.\r\n\r\n2004–2005: Rebel, Sweetheart\r\nIn July 2004, the Wallflowers returned to the studio to record their fifth album, Rebel, Sweetheart. This time the band decided to record in Atlanta, Georgia, where their producer for this album, Brendan O\'Brien, is based. O\'Brien also contributed on guitar. Fred Eltringham joined the Wallflowers as their new drummer. [arist]Jakob Dylan[/arist] wrote the songs, of which keyboardist Rami Jaffee has said: \"What I did notice is that kind of upbeat song with some pretty scary lyrics.\" Dylan painted the album\'s cover art himself.\r\n\r\nOn October 14, 2004, the Warren Zevon tribute album Enjoy Every Sandwich: The Songs of Warren Zevon was released, on which the Wallflowers covered Zevon\'s 1978 song \"Lawyers, Guns and Money.\" In promotion of the album, the Wallflowers performed \"Lawyers, Guns and Money\" on the Late Show with David Letterman with Zevon\'s son, Jordan, on October 12, 2004.\r\n\r\nOn October 31, 2004, the Wallflowers were flown via military transport plane to the USS John C. Stennis aircraft carrier in the middle of the Pacific Ocean to perform for the returning troops.\r\n\r\nRebel, Sweetheart was released on May 24, 2005, and was met with positive reviews. Despite widespread critical acclaim, Rebel, Sweetheart performed relatively poorly commercially, peaking at No. 40 on the Billboard 200. However, the first single from the album, \"The Beautiful Side Of Somewhere\", hit No. 5 on AAA radio. The second single was \"God Says Nothing Back\". This was the first Wallflowers album to be released on DualDisc. On one side was the album, and on the other was a DVD that included exclusive performances and arrangements of some of the band\'s songs, as well as an interview with comedian Jon Lovitz. In promotion of the album, the Wallflowers did concerts for the Oxygen Custom Concert Series and PBS Soundstage. Around the time of the album\'s release, the band set out on what would be their last tour for two years. They were joined by Stuart Mathis on lead guitar. After 2005, the Wallflowers ended their relationship with Interscope Records.\r\n\r\n2006–2010: Hiatus\r\n2006 was the first year in over a decade that the Wallflowers did not tour. Instead, band members embarked on other projects. Jakob Dylan toured with former Wallflowers producer T-Bone Burnett in the early summer, performing a solo acoustic opening set with a keyboard player. Later that year, he signed a contract with Columbia Records as a solo artist. He also wrote and recorded a song called \"Here Comes Now\", which was featured as the theme song for the ABC television drama Six Degrees. The show premiered in the fall of 2006. Meanwhile, keyboardist Rami Jaffee joined the Foo Fighters as a touring and session member. Jaffee had previously contributed keyboards to the Foo Fighters\' 2005 album In Your Honor. In 2006, he also contributed on albums for Willie Nile and Pete Yorn.\r\n\r\nOn August 31, 2007, the Wallflowers announced they would be touring for the first time in over two years. They toured in the Midwest and Northeastern U.S. in October and November. Before the tour, Jaffee announced that he was leaving the Wallflowers. This left Dylan, Greg Richling and Fred Eltringham as the remaining members and a guitar player, Stuart Mathis, as a touring member. In 2008, the Wallflowers toured on-and-off throughout the summer. Touring for the Wallflowers was limited as Dylan had released his first solo album, Seeing Things, on June 10, 2008. Eltringham joined Dylan on tour in promotion for the album.\r\n\r\nOn March 31, 2009, the Wallflowers released a greatest-hits album called Collected: 1996-2005. The album featured every single released from the four albums the Wallflowers released between 1996 and 2005. It also featured several non-single songs from those four albums, a demo version of \"God Says Nothing Back - Demo Version\" and an unreleased song called \"Eat You Sleeping\". That summer, the Wallflowers embarked on a U.S. tour in support of the album. In addition to Dylan, Richling, Eltringham and Mathis, Bill Appleberry joined the band on this tour as a keyboard player. The Wallflowers did not tour in 2010 as Dylan had released his second solo album, Women and Country, on April 6, 2010, and was touring in support of that album.\r\n\r\n2011–2012: Glad All Over\r\nOn November 1, 2011 Jakob Dylan announced that the Wallflowers would be reuniting to release an album, explaining: \"I never suggested we were breaking up. We all felt we were losing the plot a bit and we needed a break. And that year break becomes two years, then becomes three years, and before you know it five or six years go by pretty quickly. I can\'t do what I do in the Wallflowers without them. I miss it.\" In an interview with the St. Joseph News-Press, Dylan stated that the Wallflowers would be getting into the studio in January and the lineup would include Greg Richling on bass, Rami Jaffee on keys, Stuart Mathis on guitar and Fred Eltringham on drums. However, weeks before the Wallflowers began recording, Eltringham left the band to pursue other projects. The band quickly got former Red Hot Chili Peppers and Pearl Jam drummer Jack Irons to join the band. Irons was previously involved in a side project with Wallflowers bassist Richling.\r\n\r\nOn January 20, 2012, the Wallflowers began recording their sixth studio album, Glad All Over, at the Black Keys\' Dan Auerbach\'s Easy Eye studio in Nashville. Jay Joyce, who had played guitar on the Wallflowers\' Bringing Down The Horse agreed to produce the album. Before going to the studio, the band had decided have a more collaborative writing process than they had in the past. Instead of Dylan bringing in fully completed songs like he had done in the past, he only brought lyrics. Dylan and the rest of the band wrote the music for the songs together in the studio. Joyce explained: \"Jakob came to Nashville and we sat down and I asked him to play me a song, but instead he pulled out this 2-inch-thick notebook. ‘This is what I’ve got. Let’s play some grooves and throw it around.’ I thought, ‘Wow, that’s kind of scary, but it’s exciting.’ So we didn\'t really know going in what we were going to do. We had no songs, no demos. It was all developed in the studio. The band finished recording on February 20, 2012.\r\n\r\nAt a private solo performance in New York on April 19, 2012, Dylan announced that the new the Wallflowers album was expected to be released in fall later that year. On July 14, 2012, the band announced that the title of their new album would be \"Glad All Over\". They also announced that the album\'s first single, \"Reboot the Mission\", would be available for free download from their website.\r\n\r\nFollowing several one-off shows in the summer of 2012, the Wallflowers kicked off a fall tour in San Diego on September 8, 2012. From there, they continued to tour the U.S. and Canada through mid-November, playing a mix of clubs and festivals, with an additional four East Coast dates at the end of December. Glad All Over was released on October 9, 2012 on Columbia Records and was met with generally positive reviews. Leading up to the album\'s release, the Wallflowers promoted the album on various television shows including Good Morning America, Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, the Late Show with David Letterman and Ellen.\r\n\r\n2013–2020: Tours and roster changes\r\nBeginning in the spring of 2013, the band toured with Eric Clapton on his arena tour. The tour with Clapton began on March 14, 2013, in Phoenix, Arizona, at the US Airways Center and continued through the South and East Coast, eventually coming to an end on April 6, 2013, in Pittsburgh at the Consol Energy Center.\r\n\r\nAfter the Clapton tour, the Wallflowers played several additional shows of their own in May 2013. On May 12 in Napa, California, the band\'s longtime keyboardist Rami Jaffee played what would be his final show with the Wallflowers to date. Jaffee has yet to say whether he has officially quit the Wallflowers but has continued to record and tour with the Foo Fighters. Jimmy Wallace has subbed in his spot ever since. The Wallflowers continued to tour through the summer of 2013 and played their final show of the summer on August 17 at the River Roots Live Festival in Davenport, Iowa, to a crowd of 17,000 people. This show would turn out to be longtime bassist Greg Richling\'s and drummer Jack Irons\' final show with the band. On September 8, Richling officially announced that he was leaving the Wallflowers after 20 years with the band. He left to pursue other interests. Irons announced he was leaving soon after, on September 15. Irons reportedly left to focus on his band project, Arthur Channel, who released their debut album on October 15, 2013.\r\n\r\nThe Wallflowers have continued to play shows since 2013 with a new drummer, bass player, guitar player, and keyboardist filling in for Irons, Richling, Mathis, and Jaffee. Dylan stated later he would be continuing making music under name The Wallflowers as a solo project: \"The Wallflowers is me, and if I go under my own name, it\'s me. It\'s the same thing, ultimately. It\'s really dictated on the songs I have and how I want to record them and would they sound better with a full-band sound. In many ways it\'s the same person. It\'s just what outfit do I want to put on\". As of 2017, the touring lineup consisted of Stanton Adcock on lead guitar, Steve Mackey on bass, keyboardist Jimmy Wallace and Lynn Williams on drums.\r\n\r\nIn May 2016, the Wallflowers\' 1996 album Bringing Down The Horse was issued on vinyl for the first time in honor of the 20th anniversary of the album\'s release. In November 2017, Red Letter Days was re-issued for the album\'s 15th anniversary on black vinyl, as well as a special red vinyl edition, limited to 500 copies. On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed The Wallflowers among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire. Although, later research shows the master tapes for Bringing Down the Horse were not actually destroyed in the fire.\r\n\r\nThe band was set to undertake a North American summer tour in 2020 alongside Matchbox Twenty prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.\r\n\r\n2021–present: Exit Wounds\r\nThe band\'s seventh studio album, Exit Wounds, will be released on July 9, 2021 on New West Records. It was produced by Butch Walker and the band announced a 53-date arena tour to promote the album. About writing the album, Dylan says, \"I was just also writing during a time when the world felt like it was falling apart. That changes the way you address even the simplest things, because you have panic in your mind all the time. You have anxiety. And you also have hope. And it’s all in there\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.

Born and raised in London, he is of Scottish and English ancestry. With his distinctive raspy singing voice, Stewart is among the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold over 250 million records worldwide. He has had 10 number-one albums and 31 top ten singles in the UK, six of which reached number one. Stewart has had 16 top ten singles in the US, with four reaching number one on the Billboard Hot 100. He was knighted in the 2016 Birthday Honours for services to music and charity.\r\n\r\nStewart\'s music career began in 1962 when he took up busking with a harmonica. In 1963, he joined The Dimensions as a harmonica player and vocalist. In 1964, Stewart joined Long John Baldry and the All Stars before moving to the Jeff Beck Group in 1967. Joining Faces in 1969, he also maintained a solo career releasing his debut album that year. Stewart\'s early albums were a fusion of rock, folk music, soul music, and R&B. His third album, 1971\'s Every Picture Tells a Story, was his breakthrough, topping the charts in the UK, US, Canada and Australia, as did its ballad \"Maggie May\". His 1972 follow-up album, Never a Dull Moment, also reached number one in the UK and Australia, while going top three in the US and Canada. Its single, \"You Wear It Well\", topped the chart in the UK and was a moderate hit elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAfter Stewart had a handful more UK top ten hits, the Faces broke up in 1975. Stewart\'s next few hit singles were ballads with \"Sailing\", off the 1975 UK and Australian number-one album, Atlantic Crossing, becoming a hit in the UK and the Netherlands (number one), Germany (number four) and other countries, but barely charting in North America. A Night on the Town (1976), his fifth straight chart-topper in the UK, began a three-album run of going number one or top three in the US, Canada, the UK and Australia with each release. That album\'s \"Tonight\'s the Night (Gonna Be Alright)\" spent almost two months at number one in the US and Canada, and made the top five in other countries. Foot Loose & Fancy Free (1977) contained the hit \"You\'re in My Heart (The Final Acclaim)\" as well as the rocker \"Hot Legs\". Blondes Have More Fun (1978) and its disco-tinged \"Da Ya Think I\'m Sexy\" both went to number one in Canada, Australia and the US, with \"Da Ya Think I\'m Sexy\" also hitting number one in the UK and the top ten in other countries. Stewart\'s albums regularly hit the upper rungs of the charts in the Netherlands throughout the 70s and in Sweden from 1975 onward.\r\n\r\nAfter a disco and new wave period in the late 1970s and early 1980s, Stewart\'s music turned to a soft rock/middle-of-the-road style, with most of his albums reaching the top ten in the UK, Germany and Sweden, but faring less well in the US. The single \"Rhythm of My Heart\" was a top five hit in the UK, US and other countries, with its source album, 1991\'s Vagabond Heart, becoming, at number ten in the US and number two in the UK, his highest-charting album in a decade. In 1993, he collaborated with Bryan Adams and Sting on the power ballad \"All for Love\", which went to number one in many countries. In the early 2000s, he released a series of successful albums interpreting the Great American Songbook.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Billboard magazine ranked him the 17th most successful artist on the \"Billboard Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists\". A Grammy and Brit Award recipient, he was voted at No. 33 in Q Magazine\'s list of the Top 100 Greatest Singers of all time. As a solo artist, Stewart was inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994, the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2006, and he was inducted a second time into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012 as a member of Faces.\r\n\r\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_Stewart\r\n\r\nStudio albums\r\nAn Old Raincoat Won\'t Ever Let You Down (1969)\r\nGasoline Alley (1970)\r\nEvery Picture Tells a Story (1971)\r\nNever a Dull Moment (1972)\r\nSmiler (1974)\r\nAtlantic Crossing (1975)\r\nA Night on the Town (1976)\r\nFoot Loose & Fancy Free (1977)\r\nBlondes Have More Fun (1978)\r\nFoolish Behaviour (1980)\r\nTonight I\'m Yours (1981)\r\nBody Wishes (1983)\r\nCamouflage (1984)\r\nEvery Beat of My Heart (1986)\r\nOut of Order (1988)\r\nVagabond Heart (1991)\r\nA Spanner in the Works (1995)\r\nWhen We Were the New Boys (1998)\r\nHuman (2001)\r\nIt Had to Be You: The Great American Songbook (2002)\r\nAs Time Goes By: The Great American Songbook, Volume II (2003)\r\nStardust: The Great American Songbook, Volume III (2004)\r\nThanks for the Memory: The Great American Songbook, Volume IV (2005)\r\nStill the Same...

They are signed to Roadrunner Records. The band is composed of Chris Robertson (lead vocals, guitar), Ben Wells (guitar, background vocals), John Lawhon (bass guitar, background vocals), and John Fred Young (drums, background vocals), son of The Kentucky Headhunters\' rhythm guitarist Richard Young. Black Stone Cherry has released six studio albums and four EPs, and has charted fifteen singles on the U.S. Mainstream Rock Tracks charts.\r\n\r\nThey originate from Edmonton, Kentucky. Chris Robertson and John Fred Young, son of The Kentucky Headhunters\' rhythm guitarist Richard Young, started to play music together early in their teens and Jon and Ben soon followed. Black Stone Cherry officially formed on June 4, 2001. They then took over the practice house that had been used by The Kentucky Headhunters since 1968 and began to record tracks. After the band finished recording, they returned to Edmonton for a homecoming gig in the gym of the local middle school, which was attended by 1500 people. After the band’s self-titled debut album was released, Chris\'s former school principal invited the band back to Edmonton to celebrate with a concert. As the band entered the town, the streets were covered with signs welcoming them back.\r\n\r\nIn July 2007, they released a second EP containing the song \"Rain Wizard\" along with two previously unreleased tracks.\r\n\r\nThe first live album by Black Stone Cherry was released on October 31, 2007 immediately following the concert at the Astoria in London. They joined Def Leppard and Whitesnake in the summer of 2008 for European dates.\r\n\r\nOn August 19, 2008 Black Stone Cherry released their second album, entitled Folklore and Superstition. Three singles from the album, \"Blind Man\", \"Please Come In\" and \"Things My Father Said\" have been released.\r\n\r\nIn May 2009, they supported Nickelback\'s Dark Horse tour.\r\n\r\nThe White Trash Millionaire Songfacts states that their third studio album, Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea, got an unexpected early release on the bittorrent tracker, Demonoid on May 27, 2011 due to an employee error at an unspecified Walmart. The official release date was May 31, 2011.\r\n\r\nThe band recorded a new album in fall 2013, through early 2014. Magic Mountain was released on 6 May 2014, reaching number five in the UK albums chart. The first single was \"Me and Mary Jane\"\r\n\r\nOn October 7, 2015, it was revealed that the band had signed to Mascot Label Group, and had begun recording the follow-up to Magic Mountain for a 2016 release. The album was recorded in the same location as the self-titled album; Glasgow, Kentucky. The album, entitled Kentucky, was released on April 1, 2016 and became their second consecutive #1 album on the Billboard Hard Rock albums chart.\r\n\r\nIn February 2018, the band released their first single, Burnin\', from their new album Family Tree which released on 20th April 2018 through Mascot Records.\r\n\r\nBlack Stone Cherry\'s music style is often associated with bands like Lynyrd Skynyrd and the Black Crowes, and Led Zeppelin to a lesser extent. While there are clear influences in Black Stone Cherry’s music, they have created their own style to a great extent. The musical tone and composition of Black Stone Cherry is very comparable to that of Brand New Sin and Zakk Wylde\'s Pride and Glory.\r\n\r\nThe song writing of Black Stone Cherry is often praised for great storytelling and delivering a strong message. For example, the song \"Lonely Train\" is about the effect on families when a relative goes to fight in a war. The song \"Rain Wizard\" is about a local legend of mysterious wisemen who could bring the rain in times of drought. \"Backwoods Gold\" is about a local man who ran moonshine out of the hardware store in the middle of Edmonton. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Black+Stone+Cherry\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

In 1993, The Guinness Book Of World Records listed her as the most successful female artist ever (the title is now attributed to Madonna), partly due to her combined total of eighteen number-one singles, six of them recorded solo and the remaining dozen from her work with the Supremes.\r\n\r\nRoss was also one of the few pop singers to find modest success in the acting world winning an Academy Award nomination for her role as Billie Holiday in the 1972 film, \"Lady Sings the Blues\" as well as having hits with other film roles such as \"Mahogany\", \"Out of Darkness\" and \"Double Platinum\", not to mention her role in \"The Wiz\".\r\n\r\nRoss has been awarded many lifetime achievement accolades from many organizations and media outlets: she has been featured on BET, Soul Train, and awarded multiple times at the NAACP Image Awards, the Kennedy Center Honors in 2007 and given the Grammy Lifetime Achievement in 2011.\r\n\r\nRoss\' professional vocal collaborators have included the following during her career: Marvin Gaye, Lionel Richie, Rod Stewart, Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson, Julio Iglesias, Jose Carreras, Placido Domingo, and Smokey Robinson, among many others. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Diana+Ross\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Formed in Toronto during 1975, the trio consisted of guitarist/singer Rik Emmett, drummer/singer Gil Moore, and bassist/keyboardist Mike Levine, and issued its self-titled debut a year later via the independent Attic label. Although the album was largely ignored, it became a favorite of a radio DJ in San Antonio, Texas, which led to a regional following solidified by a tour of the state.\r\n\r\nThe exposure also gave way to a deal with RCA Records, which reissued the debut as well as Triumph\'s sophomore effort, 1977\'s Rock & Roll Machine, which spawned the group\'s first semi-hit single, a cover of Joe Walsh\'s \"Rocky Mountain Way.\" It was also around this time that the group became known for its concerts, which relied heavily on pyrotechnics and an intricate light show (just in case their following couldn\'t figure this out themselves, the trio penned a track called \"Blinding Light Show\").\r\n\r\nWith their stock rising among hard rock fans, Triumph inked a new recording contract with MCA, which led to their most successful period both artistically and commercially. Such resulting albums as 1979\'s Just a Game and 1980\'s Progressions of Power inched the group closer to breakthrough success, which was obtained by a pair of back-to-back gold-certified albums: 1981\'s Allied Forces (often considered the group\'s best album, which spawned the hit anthem \"Fight the Good Fight\") and 1982\'s Never Surrender. Such further albums as 1984\'s Thunder Seven, 1985\'s Stages, 1985\'s The Sport of Kings, and 1987\'s Surveillance failed to meet the expectations set by Triumph\'s earlier releases, yet the group was able to retain its following. Come 1988, Emmett opted to leave the group to pursue a solo career, but instead of calling it a day, Moore and Levine decided to carry on with a new frontman/guitarist, while an 11-track best-of set, Classics, was issued a year after Emmett\'s exit.\r\n\r\nTheir first choice, ex-Thin Lizzy/Whitesnake member John Sykes, was too busy getting his project Blue Murder off the ground at the time, so the gig ultimately went to former Frozen Ghost/Aldo Nova associate Phil X (it was also around this time that the group built its own recording studio in Mississauga, Ontario, called Metalworks). The Phil X-led version of the group only managed to issue a single release, however, 1993\'s Edge of Excess, before Triumph split up for good. In the wake of their breakup, several archival releases popped up in record stores, such as 1995\'s In the Beginning and 1996\'s King Biscuit Flower Hour (the latter of which chronicled a 1981 concert), while Rik Emmett continued on with his solo career, issuing albums on a regular basis throughout the \'90s.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, it was announced that Triumph were to be inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame. Subsequently, the original lineup of Emmett, Levine, and Moore reunited for several high-profile live shows leading up to their induction into the Hall of Fame during the 2008 Juno Awards. In 2012, the band released the DVD/CD set Live at Sweden Rock Festival, which documents Triumph\'s reunion concert from 2008.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are other artists with the same name:\r\n\r\n2.

The song peaked at #8 on the national charts, but had a three-week run at #1 on the R&B \"race\" chart.\r\n\r\nSingers Cleveland Duncan, Curtis Williams, Dexter Tisby, and Bruce Tate, all students at Fremont High in Los Angeles, CA, formed the quartet in 1954. They broke up in 1959.

Their midtempo performance was a cross between rhythm and blues and the new rock and roll played by white performers and enjoyed by teenagers.\r\n\r\nComing off the success of \"Earth Angel,\" The Penguins approached Buck Ram to manage them. Ram\'s primary interest was managing The Platters, who at that point had no hit singles but were a profitable touring group. With The Penguins in hand, Ram was able to swing a 2-for-1 deal with Mercury Records in which the company agreed to take on The Platters as a precondition for getting The Penguins (the group that Mercury really wanted). Ironically, The Penguins would never have a second hit single under the Mercury deal, while The Platters would be the label\'s most successful act.\r\n\r\nThe Penguins never had another national hit, but their 1957 cover of \"Pledge of Love\" reached #15 on the R&B chart.\r\n\r\nFor three decades, \"Earth Angel\" was almost always the #2 song on oldies station WCBS-FM\'s annual Top 500 countdown.

On Your Feet has proved a mainstay of the reggae/rock genre and is listed at #9 on ThePier.org\'s 10 Essential Reggae Rock Albums.\r\nThe band continued to build their following with nonstop touring throughout the Southeastern United States. They enjoyed success in opening for national acts such as Steel Pulse, Blues Traveler, Slightly Stoopid, The Wailers, Ludacris, G. Love & Special Sauce, Common, Long Beach Shortbus, Wu-Tang Clan and 311. Their fanbase was growing steadily but the band wasn\'t breaking any new ground and the trio began losing interest. After DJ Riggles left the band, the remaining duo found themselves at a crossroads until meeting Philadelphonic Studios producer Chris DiBeneditto (Philadelphonic Records), who was looking for new talent to work with and, having seen the band several times, knew they had enormous potential. Swain and Miller dedicated themselves to their craft and made the move to Philadelphia to record their newest material at Philadelphonic. Chris put his experience with G. Love & Special Sauce, Slightly Stoopid and The Expendables to work on what was to become The Movement\'s second studio album, 2008\'s Set Sail. To solidify the band\'s lineup, DiBeneditto contacted local drummer Gary Jackson to sit-in with Swain and Miller. The three hit it off immediately and Jackson brought in his friend, guitarist Jay Schmidt, to play bass. The four of them proved to be a dynamic quartet and so the current lineup was settled. In late 2010 Swain left the band and Miller took over lead vocals. Miller enlisted the help of an old friend John Bowling (Johnny Keys) to join the band and play keyboard.

On April 20, 2012 the band suddenly broke up and canceled the rest of the tour. Miller stated he needed a break while Schmidt stated that Miller left to pursue a solo career. In May 2012, it was announced that Swain would rejoin the band and assume lead vocals once more. Bowling had already left the band following the breakup the previous month. The new trio of Swain, Jackson, and Schmidt would continue on. They are slated to release a new album in the Summer of 2013 entitled, Side by Side.\r\nAfter extensive touring across the United States, The Movement has found new life and is currently gaining huge momentum on the shoulders of their well-received sophomore album.\r\n\r\n2.

The band name was inspired by a schizophrenic artist and friend in Akron, who used the term \"black keys\" to describe things he disliked or people he did not trust. The Black Keys have roots in traditional blues and psychedelic rock stylings.\r\n\r\nThey released their first album, The Big Come Up, in 2002, followed by Thickfreakness in 2003, and Rubber Factory in 2004. October 2005 saw the release of the DVD Live, recorded live at The Metro Theatre in Sydney, Australia March 18, 2005. In 2006 they released Magic Potion, as well as the lesser-known Chulahoma and a single version of Your Touch.\r\n\r\nOne of their trademarks is their preference for simple, lo-fi recording techniques. They refuse to use big-name studios, and do most recording, producing, and mixing themselves. Most of Thickfreakness was recorded in about 14 hours in Carney\'s basement, using only an early 80\'s Tascam 388 8-track recorder. Often, their recordings still have background noises (such as an owl hooting).\r\n\r\nThe Black Keys have achieved increasing critical acclaim and recognition since their debut album, which itself received praise from Rolling Stone magazine. Time magazine named them one of the \"10 Best Acts of 2003\" (behind OutKast and The White Stripes). They have supported a number of bands: they toured with Sleater-Kinney in 2003, had a short stint opening for Beck, have recently opened for Radiohead on the American leg of their brief 2006 tour, and performed at Lollapalooza in 2005 and 2007. In addition to this, they were also well-liked by influential British radio DJ John Peel and appeared on both Late Night with Conan O\'Brien and The Late Show with David Letterman. Famous followers of the band include Led Zeppelin frontman Robert Plant, Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top, Thom Yorke and Jonny Greenwood of Radiohead, and Metallica guitarist Kirk Hammet. Matt Helders, drummer for the Arctic Monkeys, can be seen in a Black Keys T-Shirt in an interview on MTV\'s RAW. \r\n\r\nTheir song \"When the Lights Go Out\" was featured in the 2007 film Black Snake Moan, and also on the soundtrack for that movie. The Black Keys were included in the soundtrack of the 2003 movie School of Rock with their song, \"Set You Free\". \"Lies\" was featured in the conclusion of the February 4, 2009 episode of Lie to Me. One of their songs, \"Girl Is on My Mind\", was used in a 2006 Sony Ericsson advertisement, starring the tennis players Ana Ivanović and Daniela Hantuchová, gaining the band more commercial recognition. It was also used in a 2006 Victoria\'s Secret commercial featuring Heidi Klum and could be heard in the movies Rest Stop and Cashback. Their song \"10 am Automatic\" was used in the video game MLB \'06: The Show, The O.C., The Go-Getter, and was also used in a 2007 American Express commercial starring Shaun White. \"Your Touch\" was featured in a 2007 Lee\'s jeans commercial, and can be heard both in an episode of NBC\'s Friday Night Lights and in an episode of \"Eastbound and Down\".

A proper video was released later in 2010, featuring Dan Auerbach and Pat Carney at a playground and was pushed on the band\'s official YouTube channel, as well as through the iTunes and Zune marketplaces.

Co-produced by Danger Mouse, the album was released to critical acclaim, receiving positive reviews from The Rolling Stones, NME and more. Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly commented on \"El Camino\", saying that \"El Camino trades the soulful stylings of Brothers for harder-driving, faster-riffing rock & roll\". At the 55th Annual Grammy Awards, El Camino won the award for Best Rock Album, while \"Lonely Boy\" received multiple honors, taking \'Best Rock Performance\' and \'Best Rock Song\'.

Young was born in Toronto, but he moved to the family home of Winnipeg as a child, which is where his music career began. Young began performing as a solo artist in Canada in 1960, before moving to California in 1966, where he co-founded the band Buffalo Springfield along with Stephen Stills and Richie Furay.\r\n\r\nHaving success on his own for a bit, he later joined the folk rock supergroup Crosby, Stills & Nash as a fourth member in 1969, thus forming Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. He forged a successful and acclaimed solo career, releasing his first album in 1968. His career has since spanned over 40 years and 34 studio albums, with a continual and uncompromising exploration of musical styles; his musical vision is notably referred to by his autobiographical tune\"The Loner\". Music critics have often called him one of the best single artists of all time, and several tunes such as \"Heart of Gold\" and \"Rockin\' in the Free World\" remain popular on rock radio.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Don\'t Be Denied Songfacts, the 16-year-old Neil was raising chickens and selling the eggs, with plans to go to Ontario Agricultural College and be a farmer. Only his leisure activities foretold his future, when he would hide from his family problems in his room with his transistor radio playing local station CHUM. From this, Young experienced a growing admiration for rock n roll originators such as Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis, and, of course, Elvis Presley. In 1958, his father bought Neil his first music instrument, a plastic ukulele. His father would later recall, \"He would close the door of his room... and we would hear plunk, pause while he moved his fingers to the next chord, plunk, pause while he moved again, plunk.\"\r\n\r\nIn Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, Neil started his professional music career in the mid-60s with a number of bands in Canada, including the Squires and later the Mynah Birds, which also included fellow future Buffalo Springfield bassist Bruce Palmer and future funk star Rick James. When the Mynah Birds broke up, Young and Palmer headed to California to meet Stephen Stills, whom he had met in Thunder Bay, and the result was Buffalo Springfield. That band split up after releasing three critically acclaimed albums, particularly achieving international fame for their tune \"For What It\'s Worth\".\r\n\r\nShowing his strengths as a cynical yet experimental songwriter in the group, he also sung prominently in some of the band\'s songs such as the biting satire of \'rock star\' life \"Mr. Soul\". Neil soon started his solo career with the release of \'Neil Young\' on November 12, 1968. The album did not do very well commercially, but it included several strong tracks, including \"The Loner\", said to be a portrait of Stephen Stills but also being deeply auto-biographical.\r\n\r\nOn May 14, 1969, he recruited members of Crazy Horse and made the critically acclaimed \'Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere\'. This was a much more consistent album, being the first to introduce longstanding collaborators Crazy Horse and beingbuilt around the balanced interplay between the guitar playing of Young and the talented Danny Whitten.  The album also featured two lengthy classics, \"Down by the River\" and \"Cowgirl in the Sand\". The critically acclaimed solo album \"After the Gold Rush\" came out in 1971, featuring such classic songs as \"Southern Man\'\", \"Only Love Can Break Your Heart\" and \"Don\'t Let it Bring You Down\". Harvest followed in 1972 with the hit\"Heart of Gold\".\r\n\r\nDuring this time he also enjoyed considerable success as a quarter of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. \r\n\r\nNeil\'s subsequent work has zig-zagged across genres - dabbling in country rock on \"Old Ways\"; electronics on \"Trans\"; hooking up with the Shocking Pinks in a homage to old-time Rock \'n\' Roll on \"Everybody\'s Rockin\'\"; creating a wall of feedback on the live Arc-Weld; and cementing his status as Godfather of Grunge when collaborating with Pearl Jam on Mirror Ball.\r\n\r\nHis idiosyncratic approach to genre even led to him being sued by his record company (Geffen) in the 80s for making \"uncharacteristic\" music.\r\n\r\nYoung has also dabbled in film, most recently on the album/concert series/dvd Greendale. \r\n\r\nYoung is often known by the nickname \"Shakey.\"  According to his biographer Jimmy McDonough, the name was given by his friends after noticing very unsteady results holding a camera for home movies.\r\n\r\nYoung founded Pono Music, whose mission was to bring a digital player, download store, and streaming service devoted to hi-res music.  It was a commercial flop and was shut down in 2016.  Young has stated that the labels would not agree that \"All songs should cost the same, regardless of digital resolution.\"\r\n\r\nThe film Canadian Bacon includes the line \"Canadians are always trying to figure out a lot of ways to ruin our lives.

The band currently consists of four animated members: Murdoc Niccals (bass guitar) who formed the band, 2-D (lead vocals, keyboards), Noodle (guitar, vocals) and Russel Hobbs (drums and percussion). Their fictional universe is explored through animated music videos, interviews and animated shorts. In reality, Albarn is the only permanent musical contributor and often collaborates with other musicians.\r\n\r\nThe roots of Gorillaz can be traced back to 1990, when guitarist Graham Coxon asked cartoonist Jamie Hewlett to interview his newly formed band, Blur. Coxon knew of Hewlett\'s work drawing the Tank Girl comic strip in Deadline magazine. When Jamie first met the band\'s lead singer Damon Albarn, the two did not hit it off well. Hewlett initially thought Albarn was \"arsey\" and \"a wanker,\" but the two remained acquainted and would eventually become roommates in 1997, living in London. \r\n\r\nBoth  Jamie and Damon tell the story of The Gorillaz\' conception same way. They were in their flat watching TV, specifically MTV, and came up with the idea of a \"virtual band\" as commentary on the vapidity of popular music at the turn of the millennium. Previously the best-known \'\"cartoon bands\" were The Archies and Josie and the Pussycats, that kids could watch on Saturday mornings. But Gorillaz (initially called just \"Gorilla\") was to be an ambitious musical project with eclectic, genre-bending tunes,  unique visuals, and a detailed backstory for how the virtual band came to be. \r\n\r\nWith Gorillaz, Albarn departed from the distinct  Britpop of Blur and explored influences including hip hop, electronic music, and world music through an \"eccentrically postmodern\" approach. The band\'s 2001 debut album Gorillaz sold over seven million copies worldwide. It was nominated for the Mercury Prize, but the nomination was withdrawn at the band\'s request. Their second studio album, Demon Days (2005), went six times platinum in the UK and double platinum in the US, and has sold over eight million copies worldwide. The band has won other awards, including one Grammy Award, two MTV Video Music Awards, an NME Award and three MTV Europe Music Awards.\r\n\r\nThe third Gorillaz studio album, Plastic Beach, was released in March 2010. The fourth, The Fall, was released in December 2010 as a free download for fan club members, then in April 2011 as a physical release. In 2017, after a five-year hiatus, Gorillaz announced their fifth studio album Humanz. Their sixth studio album, The Now Now, was released on 29 June 2018. Their seventh album, Song Machine, Season 1: Strange Timez, was released in 2020 through a series of episodical music videos. Cracker Island, the band\'s eighth album, was released on February 24, 2023. Gorillaz have been nominated for ten Brit Awards and won Best British Group at the 2018 Brit Awards.\r\n\r\nThe Gorillaz characters only appear in animated form and are not alter-egos of real people, as is often mistakenly assumed. There is an extensive fictional back-story behind these band members, written by Albarn and Hewlett. Their albums, several of their music videos, and their autobiographical book Rise Of The Ogre all tell the saga. Damon Albarn is the only permanent musical contributor to the band, which is also a collaboration between various musicians. Their style is broad with a large number of alternative influences including rock, hip-hop, and electronica.\r\n\r\nThey have released eight studio albums: Gorillaz (2001), Demon Days (2005), Plastic Beach (2010), The Fall (Also in 2010), Humanz (2017), The Now Now (2018), Song Machine, Season One: Strange Timez (2020), and Cracker Island (2023). Additionally, they have put out two B-side collections, G-Sides (2001) and D-Sides (2007), and a reggae remix of the Gorillaz album entitled Laika Come Home (2002). The band has also released three DVDs: Phase One: Celebrity Takedown, Demon Days: Live at Manchester Opera House, and Phase Two: Slow Boat To Hades. At the end of 2010, Gorillaz released their next album, The Fall, which was recorded during their US \'Escape to Plastic Beach\' tour. It is promoted as being the first album made entirely on iPad. The album is streamed on the Gorillaz website. \r\n\r\nThe band\'s first single, Clint Eastwood, was released on 5 March 2001. This single was the first of four from Gorillaz, which was released  on 26 March 2001. The other three singles were released over the next year. These were: 19-2000, Rock the House, and Tomorrow Comes Today. The album sold over 7 million copies worldwide and has gone platinum twice in the United Kingdom earning them an entry in the Guinness Book of Records as the Most Successful Virtual Band. It was nominated for the Mercury Prize, but the nomination was later withdrawn at the band\'s request. Collaborators on the first album included Del tha Funkee Homosapien (often mistaken for a full-time band member), Miho Hatori (formerly of Cibo Matto), Tina Weymouth of Talking Heads.and Ibrahim Ferrer. The album was produced by Dan the Automator of Deltron 3030.\r\n\r\nAt the end of 2001 the band released another single, 911, which was a collaboration between Gorillaz and rap artists D12, Eminem and Terry Hall. The single would find its way onto the soundtrack to the 2002 action comedy Bad Company.\r\n\r\nTheir second studio album, Demon Days, was released on 11 May  2005 and included the hit singles Feel Good Inc., DARE, Dirty Harry and Kids With Guns / El Mañana. Demon Days went five times platinum in the UK, double platinum in the United States, and earned five Grammy award nominations for 2006 and won one of them (Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals). Collaborators on this album – produced by Dj Danger Mouse – include De La Soul, Bootie Brown of The Pharcyde, Shaun Ryder of the Happy Mondays, Neneh Cherry, Ike Turner, MF Doom, Roots Manuva, and Martina Topley-Bird, among others.  DARE – the first Gorillaz track featuring lead vocals by Noodle – reached #1 in the UK charts.\r\n\r\nIn late 2007, Albarn and Hewlett began working on Carousel, a new Gorillaz project which eventually evolved into the band\'s third studio album, Plastic Beach, which was released 9 March 2010. Albarn said, \"I\'m making this one the most pop record I\'ve ever made in many ways, but with all my experience to try and at least present something that has got depth.” The album features guest performances by Snoop Dogg, Lou Reed, Mos Def, Bobby Womack, Gruff Rhys, Mark E. Smith, Mick Jones, Paul Simonon, Bashy,  Kano, De La Soul, Little Dragon, Hypnotic Brass Ensemble, sinfonia ViVA, and The Lebanese National Orchestra for Oriental Arabic Music. \r\n\r\nA 3D projection of the group was shown at the 2005 MTV Music Awards and the 2006 Grammys. They also performed at the Brits, in a different format, using screens rather than projections. Gorillaz have performed live in other occasions as well: in 2001 & 2002 they did tours where the musicians played behind screens, and in 2005 & 2006, Gorillaz had five nights in Manchester and New York respectively. This time the screens were behind the musicians, who were visible to the audience only as silhouettes (except for the guest-stars).\r\n\r\nSince the band began to achieve mainstream success, there have been rumours of them working on a full-length movie. Some of these have been confirmed, but nothing has gotten beyond planning stages, mainly due to conflicts between the band and studios involved. In 2008, Hewlett said \"Ultimately we didn\'t think that feel we\'re in a position to make the kind of movie we want to make with Gorillaz at the moment. [...] But I\'d still like to make a full, lavishly-animated Gorillaz movie someday.\"\r\n\r\nAlbarn and Hewlett created a Pop Opera called Monkey: Journey to the West, which premiered in the summer of 2007 at the Manchester International Festival. A soundtrack album was recorded in the summer as well (initially only digitally available though a CD version was released in 2008). The production went on to show at the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris in September-October 2007, the Spoleto Festival in Charleston, SC, USA in May 2008, and the Royal Opera House in London in July 2008.\r\n\r\nThe duo behind the Pop Opera built on ideas from Monkey: Journey to the West to release a short film in the Summer of 2008 which accompanied the United Kingdom\'s coverage of the BBC Olympic Coverage in Beijing. It featured a basic outline of the main plot elements of the Opera, reworked into a \"Journey to the East\", with the characters finishing in the Beijing Olympic Stadium. \r\n\r\nGorillaz headlined the Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury 2010, as an immediate replacement for U2, who dropped out of performing at the festival.\r\n\r\nAt the end of 2010 Gorillaz released their next album The Fall made in the hotel rooms during their US tour. It was, when released, the first album to be recorded entirely on an iPad. The album was made available for free to Gorillaz fan club members for a limited time as a digital download – and hard copies were released to worldwide markets in the following year.\r\n\r\nIn April 2012, Albarn told The Guardian that he and Hewlett had fallen out and that future Gorillaz projects were \"unlikely\".  However, it was later announced by the duo that they had reconciled their difference – and that Noodle, Russel, Murdoc and 2-D would return with a new album in 2017.  Featuring collaborations by artists such as album Grace Jones, Kali Uchis, Popcaan, Vince Staples, Mavis Staples, Peven Everett, Pusha T, Kelela, Jamie Principle, D.R.A.M. and Graham Coxon, Humanz was released to critical acclaim; the album would go on to win Gorillaz the 2018 Brit Award for Best British Group.  Gorillaz would also collaborate with Carly Simon, Kilo Kish and Rag\'n\'Bone Man on the Deluxe edition of Humanz, while Little Simz would feature on the single Garage Palace.  Another 2017 release was the single Sleeping Powder – supposedly written and recorded in a day.  Meanwhile, a solar energy-themed collaboration with E.ON, released in 2017, would later win Gorillaz a Webby Award.  \r\n\r\nA new album, The Now Now, would follow in 2018.  Written by Albarn whilst touring Humanz – and featuring two collaborations, including the return of Snoop Dogg and Jamie Principle as well as George Benson and Graham Coxon – The Now Now spawned six singles, including Humility, Tranz, and Lake Zürich.  Murdoc was unable to enjoy the band\'s success for the time being as he was undergoing a stint in jail for an undisclosed malefaction; he was replaced on bass for Ace Copular – who most famously played Ace of the Gangreen Gang in the Powerpuff Girls TV series – for the recording of The Now Now; however, Murdoc would later break his way out of prison.  Gorillaz saw the year out by securing another Brits nomination for Best British Group as well as winning a second consecutive Webby Award; this time, for the FreeMurdoc chatbot, which provided a way for Gorillaz fans to interact with Murdoc Niccals during his incarceration. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Gorillaz\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The group was officially announced in February 2012 as a re-branding of Welch\'s solo music project.\r\n\r\nThe group is effectively a re-branding of the touring group that performed under Welch\'s name to promote his solo album. Formed in 2009, Welch recruited musicians through open auditions via YouTube, and second-round auditions, in person, at his studio in Phoenix, Arizona. The original group was a six-piece group, that featured Michael Valentine on Bass, Ralph Patlan on guitar, Brian Ruedy on keyboard, Scott \"SVH\" Von Heldt on guitars and vocals and Dan Johnson on drums. After two years of touring, Von Heldt departed the band due to financial reasons, Ruedy was let go a few months earlier and later joined Whitesnake. Patlan also departed the band, but no reason was given. The search began to find a guitar player. In March 2011, two weeks before a tour, Welch discovered \"the perfect fit\" for his band through Thousand Foot Krutch\'s public audition videos for a new guitarist on Youtube. 15 years old at the time, J.R. Bareis was chosen by Welch to be the new guitar player and became an official permanent member of the band, as they settled on establishing themselves as a four-piece. The group released a single, \"Paralyzed\" in November 2011, under the Brian \"Head\" Welch name. In February 2012, the touring band was re-branded into the group Love and Death.\r\n\r\nLove and Death was formally announced in February 2012 through an official statement made by Welch. In the statement, Welch explained that \"I have wanted to use a band name for branding my music for a few years. It has been an ongoing discussion with my management, but we were just starting to tour and I was in the middle of supporting my third book and it seemed like a bad time to switch names. Now with the new music coming out, its time to really separate the things I do. I want the music to be about music. I will still be doing public speaking under Brian Head Welch. I am happy that all the confusion will be over.\" <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Love+and+Death\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Formed in 1991, the group gained fame in 1993 following the release of their debut album, titled \'August and Everything After\', when track \"Mr. Jones\" became a big hit. Known for their melancholic yet melodic songwriting, the band started when singer Adam Duritz (previously of The Himalayans and Sordid Humor) teamed up with guitarist David Bryson (local producer and former member of the band Mr. Dog) in San Francisco, California in 1990. Counting Crows originally performed as an acoustic duo, playing gigs in and around the cities of Berkeley and San Francisco.\r\n\r\nFor the group\'s first album, Adam and David added bassist Matt Malley, multi-instrument talent Charlie Gillingham, and drummer Steve Bowman.  David Immergluck served as the second guitarist on the first album, but he did not officially join the band until 1999.  Guitarist Dan Vickery was added just as the band set out on their first tour. As stated before, \'August and Everything After\' provided the band with a surprise yet very welcome success, garnering them critical praise. Released on September 14, 1993 through Geffen Records, the album hit #2 on Billboard\'s Heatseekers chart, showing that their tunes had tapped into something.\r\n\r\nCounting Crows, with their intimate and confessional yet smooth, often catchy musical approach, achieved a large fan base among melodic rock fans over the years. Their 90s acclaim reflected that a significant music scene looked for something different from the raging guitars of the Seattle-based grunge movement as well as from either boilerplate pop music or the budding electronic music subgenres. The group kept on releasing new songs into the new millennium.\r\n\r\nThe band\'s more recent successes include the 2004 hit song \"Accidentally In Love\", which was featured on the Shrek 2 soundtrack (that has sold over 1,000,000 copies). That song has also garnered nominations for a Grammy Award, a Golden Globe Award, and an Academy Award. That same year, the band released their first ever best of set, which they titled \'Films about Ghosts\'. That album features songs from every phase of the Counting Crows\' recording career. To date, the band has sold over 20 million albums worldwide. \r\n\r\nThe group made the news when \'Saturday Nights & Sunday Mornings\' was released on March 25th, 2008. In addition, on January 16, 2008, the band released a digital EP as a free download on their official web site, consisting of the songs \"1492\" and \"When I Dream Of Michelangelo\". The lead single from the album was \"You Can\'t Count On Me\", which was released for radio play on February 4, 2008.\r\n\r\nThe album itself is thematically and stylistically divided into two parts: the first, more rock-influenced Saturday Nights, and the second, more country-influenced Sunday Mornings. Theme changes along with style; in the Sunday Mornings portion of the album, songs become more reflective. The iTunes release contains several bonus tracks, including a track-by-track interview with Duritz.\r\n\r\nMembers of the band:\r\nAdam Duritz - lead vocals, piano, wurlitzer, tamborine\r\nDavid Bryson - guitars, dobro, vocals\r\nCharles Gillingham - piano, organ, accordion, mellotron, vocals\r\nDan Vickery - guitars, sitar, banjo, vocals\r\nDavid Immergluck - guitars, bass, electric sitar, mandolin, vocals\r\nJim Bogios - drums, percussion loops, vocals\r\nMillard Powers - bass guitar, upright bass, piano, vocals\r\n\r\nEx-members of the band:\r\nMatt Malley - guitars, double bass, vocals\r\nBen Mize - drums, percussion, tambourine, bulbs, vocals\r\nSteve Bowman - drums, vocals\r\nBen Ulrich - drums\r\nMarty Jones - bass guitar\r\nLydia Holly - keyboards\r\nToby Hawkins - drums\r\n\r\nAlbums\r\nAugust And Everything After - (September 14, 1993)\r\nRecovering The Satellites - (October 14, 1996)\r\nAcross a Wire - Live in New York City - (1998)\r\nThis Desert Life - (November 1, 1999)\r\nHard Candy - (July 8, 2002)\r\nFilms About Ghosts: The Best Of - (November 25, 2003)\r\n*New Amsterdam: Live At Heineken Music Hall - (June 19, 2006)\r\nAugust And Everything After, Deluxe Edition - (Fall 2007)\r\nSaturday Nights & Sunday Mornings - (March 25, 2008)\r\nSomewhere Under Wonderland - (September 2, 2014)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Counting+Crows\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The band\'s line-up, unchanged until their breakup, consisted of Bradley Nowell (vocals and guitar), Eric Wilson (bass), and Bud Gaugh (drums). Lou Dog, Nowell\'s dalmatian, was the mascot of the band. Nowell died of a heroin overdose in 1996, resulting in Sublime\'s breakup. In 1997, songs such as \"What I Got\", \"Santeria\", \"Wrong Way\", \"Doin\' Time\", and \"April 29, 1992 (Miami)\" were released to U.S. radio.\r\n\r\nSublime released three studio albums, one live album, five compilation albums (one of which also contains never-before released material), three EPs, and one box set. Although their first two albums—40oz. to Freedom (1992) and Robbin\' the Hood (1994)—were quite popular in the United States, Sublime did not experience major commercial success until 1996 with their self-titled third album, released two months after Nowell\'s death, which peaked at No. 13 on the Billboard 200, and spawned the single \"What I Got\", which remains the band\'s only No. 1 hit single (on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart) in their musical career. As of 2009, the band has sold over 17 million albums worldwide, including about ten million in the U.S. alone. Michael \"Miguel\" Happoldt and Marshall \"Ras MG\" Goodman contributed to several Sublime songs.\r\n\r\nFollowing Sublime\'s dissolution, former members Eric Wilson and Bud Gaugh founded the Long Beach Dub Allstars in 1997, which also included many frequent Sublime contributors such as Michael \"Miguel\" Happoldt (former member of The Ziggens), Marshall Goodman \"Ras MG\" (former Sublime member), and Todd Forman (3rd Alley). LBDAS disbanded in 2002, due to several members of the band breaking a no-drug vow they had taken.  In 2009, the surviving members attempted to reform the band with Rome Ramirez, a young guitarist and admitted Sublime fan from California. However, not long after performing at Cypress Hill\'s Smokeout Festival, a Los Angeles judge banned the new lineup from using the Sublime name as they needed permission from Nowell\'s estate, which owns the rights to the Sublime name. This prompted the lineup of Wilson, Gaugh and Ramirez to change their name to Sublime with Rome, which has since released three albums, although Gaugh left the group shortly after the release of their 2011 debut Yours Truly. \r\n\r\nWith the mainstream success of their self-titled album, going five times platinum and earning worldwide airplay, Sublime\'s influence persists to this day. Sublime was one of the most popular bands of the third wave of ska, specifically characterized as ska punk. Sublime often combined punk rock and hardcore punk with hip hop, heavy metal, dancehall, reggae, ska, funk, and (21st century) surf music. Sublime also has been described as \'reggae rock\'.\r\n\r\nTheir signature sound and their songs are often associated with the beach and coastal areas of Southern California, such as San Diego, Orange County, Venice Beach and Long Beach as well as areas of Northern California like Eureka. Over two decades after Nowell\'s death and the band\'s breakup, Sublime remains immensely popular throughout North America, especially in its state of origin, California.\r\n\r\nSublime\'s songs have been featured via soundtrack in a variety of media. Los Angeles alternative rock radio station KROQ has listed Sublime at No. 3 in their annual \"Top 106.7 biggest KROQ bands of all time\" list for the past six years in a row, behind Red Hot Chili Peppers and Nirvana, and No. 81 at the \"Top 166 Artists of 1980–2008\" list.\r\n\r\nWith over 17 million units sold worldwide, Sublime is one of the most successful, and \"powerfully moving\" ska-punk acts of all time influencing many modern reggae and ska acts. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Sublime\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

His music is driven by an optimism shaped by life’s bumpy journey, a faith in the power of love and hard work to overcome the obstacles we all face every day.\r\n\r\nGrowing up in the working class beach city of Newcastle in NSW, Morgan turned the blue-collar ethic of his neighborhood into a relentless drive for energy and connection in his live shows. After seeing him whip a festival crowd into a frenzy, Warner Music Australia offered Morgan a recording contract. \r\n\r\nIn 2013, after releasing two hit EPs that yielded three #1 singles, Morgan was named New Oz Artist of the Year at the CMC Music Awards. The fan voted award solidified his status as the hottest young performer in Australian country and was followed by four more trophies over the next two years, including back-to-back Male Oz Artist of the Year awards.\r\n\r\nSoon Morgan returned to Nashville to record his debut album with an all-star group of A-list musicians and Nashville based Aussie ex-pat producer Jedd Hughes.\r\n\r\n“To hear guys who played on the songs that inspired me to become a musician, playing on my songs, blew my mind,” said Morgan. “It reminded me of why I was doing this in the first place and pushed me to take my vocals and guitar playing on the album to the next level”.\r\n\r\nThe songs that make up Morgan Evans are the result of a relentless songwriting schedule for almost a year that took Morgan to Nashville and back, and saw him tap into the deepest parts of himself. Morgan wrote eleven of the twelve tracks - some by himself, some with local artists and many with A-list Nashville writers.\r\nThe album, released in March 2014, immediately shot to #1 on the iTunes and ARIA Country Album Charts and debuted at #20 on the ARIA Mainstream Album Chart. \r\n\r\nThe impact of the acclaimed album has been immense – 3 #1 singles (One Eye for an Eye, Best I Never Had and record-equaling Like A Tornado) and his first APRA nominations just for starters. The release also garnered international attention, leading to an invitation to return to Nashville’s massive CMA Music Festival and perform at the legendary Grand Ole Opry, which prompted William Morris Endeavor – the world’s largest talent agency – to sign Morgan up for international representation. \r\nMorgan’s charisma and talent for engaging audiences led to his signing as the face of Foxtel’s Country Music Channel, which has already seen him nominated for an ASTRA Award and a TV Week Logie Award – a first for an Australian country music star. He hosts television coverage of the CMC Rocks music festival, artist interviews and the CMC Music Awards. He was joined in 2016 by international co-host Kelsea Ballerini for the live national broadcast.\r\n\r\nA major career milestone was capped off when Morgan received a message from Grammy-winners Lady Antebellum informing him that he’d been awarded the prestigious 2015 CMA Global Artist Award. The award recognizes outstanding achievement by an international country star in furthering the popularity of country music in their home country. Morgan joins an exceptional list of previous winners including Tommy Emmanuel, Kasey Chambers and Lee Kernaghan.\r\n\r\nSince then, Morgan has his sights set once again on Nashville, relocating to Music City where he has been writing with the A-list of songwriters for his upcoming US debut release and recently made return performances to CMA Music Fest and the Grand Ole Opry.\r\n\r\nHis growing fanbase in both Australia and the USA is eagerly awaiting new music from Morgan, expected to be released later this year. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Morgan+Evans\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Widely regarded as the most talented group of rock musicians Argentina produced in the late 70\'s and early 80\'s, to the point they were dubbed \"The Argentinean Beatles\" by fans and critics alike.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving La Máquina De Hacer Pájaros, García moved to Brazil to start his new project. In 1978, \"Serú Girán\" was released after recording sessions in São Paulo and Los Angeles, U.S., having Daniel Goldberg in charge of its orchestral arrangements. \r\n\r\nThat album was presented first to music journalists and later at Buenos Aires\' Luna Park. The press was pleased, but music fans weren\'t prepared for the experimental style played by the band. \r\n\r\nThat mixed response drove Serú Girán to release a less complicated album in 1979 called \"La Grasa De Las Capitales\", presented live at the Buenos Aires\' Auditorium. \"Bicicleta\" came in 1980, followed by a show at the Monterrey Jazz Festival in Rio de Janeiro. \r\n\r\n\"Peperina\" was released in 1981. The band decided to break up after two shows at Obras Sanitarias in March 1982. \r\n\r\nSerú Girán came back with \"Serú\" in 1992 and later with\"Yo No Quiero Volverme Tan Loco\" in the year 2000.\r\n\r\nOscar Moro died in Buenos Aires on July 11th, 2006. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Ser%C3%BA+Gir%C3%A1n\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Brett Eldredge recognized his as it was happening.\r\n\r\nThe Paris, IL, native was visiting Nashville for the first time early in his sophomore year at Chicago\'s Elmhurst College. He was at the Station Inn, an historic bluegrass/country venue where many of the greats of both worlds have played. His cousin Terry, a veteran of Dolly Parton\'s band and now a member of the Grascals, was playing with a band called the Sidemen, and a mesmerized Brett was in the crowd.\r\n\r\n\"There was something so real and truthful about the songs they were playing,\" he says. “What happened next came as a shock.”\r\n\r\n\"He asked me to come up on stage and told me to pick a song to play with the band,\" says Brett. I said, \'Amarillo By Morning,\' and when I heard that fiddle intro, chills shot up my spine. I sang it for the crowd there and it was a magical experience. That was the point where I thought, \'This is it. This is something I\'ve got to do.\'\"\r\n\r\nBy the start of the next school year, he had transferred to Middle Tennessee State University and begun the round of writers\' nights and writing appointments that led him eventually to a record deal.\r\n	The talent that let him turn that dream into reality—the depth of his writing and the sheer power of his smoky and expressive baritone—are both apparent in his first single. \"Raymond\" is the poignant tale of a nursing home employee mistaken by a patient with Alzheimer\'s for her deceased son, who was killed at war. It is a song whose inspiring reaffirmation of their mutual humanity is affecting listeners deeply. The single rings true for Eldredge as his Grandmother currently struggles through the disease.\r\n	\"There are a lot of things I\'ll play live where people will say, \'I like that,\' or \'That\'s a really cool song,\'\" Brett says, \"but when I do this one, I get the chance to tell people how special a thing it\'s been in my life, and it always touches someone. A lot of people know someone with Alzheimer\'s and people react in a really emotional way to it.\"\r\n	Brett has earned a reputation as much for the strength of his writing as for his world-class voice. He and co-writer Pat McLaughlin landed a song called \"I Think I\'ve Had Enough\" on Gary Allan\'s latest album, Get Off On The Pain, and one of his frequent collaborators is Country Music Hall of Famer and Grand Ole Opry stalwart Bill Anderson.\r\n	\"He\'s one of my favorite people to write with,\" says Brett. \"I love the fact that he believes in country music so much, because it\'s something I really believe in. My dream, as I find my place in country music, is one day to be an Opry member.\"\r\n	Brett heard all kinds of music growing up, and became a particular fan of the classic pop singers he heard in his grandfather\'s car.\r\n	\"I heard a lot of Frank Sinatra, who is still a favorite of mine, and Ray Charles and Bobby Darin,\" he says. \"When my mother convinced me to sing \'Mack The Knife\' at a talent show, I got hooked on singing in public.\"\r\n	That was in Paris, a town of 9,000 with \"cornfields and factories and lake right in the middle.\" Brett, his older brother and his parents—a traveling grain salesman and a nurse—lived on the lake and, says Brett, \"We were on the water every day, from the time I was so little they could pull me on water skis in a paddle boat until I left for college at 18.\" Sports were a big part of his life, and he played basketball, baseball and football in high school.\r\n	He also sang everywhere he could, often the Big Band music of Sinatra, earning spending money and learning to work a stage. His appreciation for country music became a passion when he turned 16 and he and a friend rode around listening to a Brooks & Dunn greatest hits album.\r\n	\"There was something about it that just struck me,\" he says. \"I couldn\'t get enough of it. Ronnie Dunn is one of my favorite singers of all time—I love the soul in his voice—and one of the main reasons I got into this in the first place.\"\r\n	Brett spent two years in Chicago, where his older brother lived, performing with a school jazz band and with a Big Band around the region.\r\n	\"One of the coolest gigs,\" he says, \"was at the Field Museum, I was singing in front of a 12-piece band under this huge Tyrannosaurus Rex statue near some mammoths. It was quite the experience.\"\r\n	Then came that fateful visit to Nashville and his transfer to MTSU. He studied classic country stylists like Ray Price and George Jones, and later Vince Gill, absorbing everything he could.\r\n	\"I was driving back and forth Nashville every day from Murfreesboro, which is thirty miles away,\" he says. \"I had a guitar Terry had given me, which was originally a gift from Dolly, and I\'d pretty much lock myself in my room and make myself learn songs. I would play writers\' nights all around Nashville. There might be two people, there might be 40 or 50. I\'d go play my songs and see what people liked and what they didn\'t. I\'d screw up royally in front of them, but I learned.\"\r\n	He earned a degree, which, he says, \"made Mom and Dad happy, and then I moved on to what I really wanted to do.\r\n	A staff writer for hit producer/publisher Byron Gallimore heard him at a writers\' night and introduced him to Byron, who signed him.\r\n	\"I wrote for about two years, developing my craft and writing with everyone I could. In the beginning, Byron just let me kind of find myself, because that takes a while. As you write more you starting homing in on what you sound good on. Eventually, Byron said, \'You\'ve got something here\' and we went in and started cutting songs. We did a showcase, and Carole Ann Mobley from Warner Music Nashville said, \'We\'ve gotta sign this kid\'. Mobley and Craig Kallman then signed Brett to Atlantic Records, making him the first official signing for the new imprint.\r\n	As he worked with his band tightening his show, he was offered a particularly gratifying gig.\r\n	\"I opened for Blake Shelton at The Ryman and it was the coolest experience. I flew back from this house gig and all of a sudden I\'m thrown into playing the Mother Church of Country Music, something I always dreamed of doing. I was operating on almost no sleep, but stepping out on that stage where everybody who\'s anybody in country music has been meant the world to me.\"\r\n	He remains active in sports, playing basketball and volleyball and playing on an intramural softball team in Nashville, and rooting for the Cubs and Bears. Meanwhile, he is dedicated to improving his craft.\r\n	\"As a songwriter,\" he says, \"my aim is to portray a little bit of me and my life along with the stories of other people and turn them into something that can really touch somebody\'s heart and soul. We sit down on Music Row every day and write songs and every once in a while a song like ‘Raymond’ comes from such a real place. I hope it\'s that real to other people and that I can make them feel the way I felt when I wrote it and when I sing it.\"\r\n	Judging from audience reaction, that’s exactly what he’s doing. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Brett+Eldredge\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

He was raised in a suburb of Chicago, IL, where he discovered music at an early age. As the son of a minister, he grew up in the front pew, listening to his mom harmonize and following her lead. By the time he reached high school, Matthew remained involved in music and received a scholarship to study music at Millikin University in Illinois.\r\n\r\nDuring his first year of college, Matthew began playing guitar and writing songs. By his senior year, he was performing at various venues, from fraternity houses to churches and youth groups.\r\n\r\nOnly a week after graduating and making the move to Nashville, he signed an exclusive songwriting deal. His songs have been recorded by various artists, including Rachel Lampa’s most recent single, “Savior Song,” which marked Matthew’s first top-5 song as a writer. Other highlights include having songs placed on the platinum-selling WoW 2002 project and his song “Heart of Every Man” recorded for the World Youth Day 2000 official soundtrack.\r\n\r\nMatthew continued pursuing his dream of singing his own songs. He had the opportunity to travel to universities across the country, quickly building up a steady following. With the help of Word Music and Extreme Writers Group, Matthew recorded an independent CD called Sellout, which caught the attention of Universal South Records\r\n\r\nAfter signing with major-label Universal South, Matthew West released several albums.

Three years later, Live Forever (2015) became another landmark album, reaching number one on the Billboard Christian Albums Chart and number 51 on the Top 200. All In (2017), West’s seventh studio album, featured the single \"Broken Things,\" earning him the Songwriter of the Year award at the 2018 Dove Awards.\r\n\r\nIn 2020, West delivered his eighth outing, Brand New, launching his own imprint, Story House Music. In February 2023, he released the expansive double album My Story Your Glory, featuring collaborations with artists like David Leonard and Jenn Johnson. The hit single \"Me on Your Mind\" stood out.

Rolling Stone placed Wray at No. 45 of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time. In 2013 he was a nominee for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Though he began in country music, his musical style went on to consist primarily of rock and roll, rockabilly, and instrumental rock.\r\n\r\nWray was born on May 2, 1929 in Dunn, North Carolina, to Fred Lincoln Wray, Sr. and his wife, Lillian M. Wray (née Coats). They were Shawnee Native Americans. Three songs he performed were named for American Indian tribes: \"Shawnee\", \"Apache\", and \"Comanche\". \"Apache\" was an instrumental composed by Jerry Lordan; it was originally a hit in the United Kingdom for The Shadows in 1960. Wray recorded a cover version 30 years later, when it was also associated with The Ventures and the Incredible Bongo Band.\r\n\r\nWray served in the US Army during the Korean War, and contracted tuberculosis, which laid him up in a hospital for a year. His stay concluded with the removal of a lung, which doctors predicted would mean he would never be able to sing again.\r\n\r\nIn 1958, Wray\'s first hit, \"Rumble\", was banned in New York and Boston for fear it would incite teenage gang violence. The record was first released on Cadence Records as Cat # 1347 (as Link Wray and the Ray-Men). Before, during, and after his stints with major labels Epic and Swan, Wray released 45\'s under many names. Tiring of the corporate music machine, he began recording albums using a three-track studio he converted from an outbuilding on his brother\'s property that his father used to raise chickens.\r\n\r\nWhile living in the San Francisco Bay Area in the early 1970s, Wray was introduced to Quicksilver Messenger Service guitarist John Cipollina by bassist James \"Hutch\" Hutchinson. He subsequently formed a band initially featuring special guest Cipollina along with the rhythm section from Cipollina\'s band Copperhead, bassist James \"Hutch\" Hutchinson, and drummer David Weber. They opened for the band Lighthouse at The Whisky a Go Go in Los Angeles from May 15–19, 1974. He later did numerous concerts and radio broadcasts in the Bay Area including KSAN (FM) and the Bill Graham venue Winterland Ballroom, with Les Lizama later replacing Hutchinson on bass. He toured and recorded two albums with retro-rockabilly artist Robert Gordon in the late 1970s. The 1980s to the present day saw a large number of reissues as well as new material. One member of his band in the 1980s, drummer Anton Fig, later became drummer in the CBS Orchestra on the Late Show with David Letterman. In 1994, he played on four songs of the album Chatterton by French rocker Alain Bashung.\r\n\r\nWray\'s first three marriages—to Elizabeth Canady Wray, Katherine Tidwell Wray, and Sharon Wray—each ended in divorce. Although Wray had eight children with his first three wives, he had little contact with any of them after relocating to Denmark in the early 1980s.\r\n\r\nWray died of heart failure at his home in Copenhagen, at the age of 76. Survivors included his fourth wife, Olive Julie Povlsen Wray, and their son. He was buried in the crypt of the Christian\'s Church, Copenhagen.\r\n\r\nJack Rose cited Wray as an influence, as did Iggy Pop and Neil Young. Jimmy Page says that Link Wray had a \"real rebel attitude\" and credits him in It Might Get Loud as a major influence in his early career. According to Rolling Stone, Pete Townshend of The Who once said, \"If it hadn\'t been for Link Wray and \'Rumble,\' I never would have picked up a guitar.\" \"The only people I ever really looked up to were Link Wray and Iggy Pop,\" said Mark E.

The band consists of Will Toledo (vocals, guitar, piano, and synthesizers), Ethan Ives (guitar, bass, backing vocals), Seth Dalby (bass), and Andrew Katz (drums, percussion).\r\n\r\nBeginning as a solo recording project by Toledo in 2010, Car Seat Headrest self-released 12 albums on the music platform Bandcamp, before signing to Matador Records in 2015. Car Seat Headrest would begin touring as a full band the following year.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\n2010–2014: Lo-fi and solo releases, from 1 to How to Leave Town\r\nCar Seat Headrest began as the solo project of singer/songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Will Toledo (born William Barnes) shortly after he graduated high school. Toledo had previously released music under the alias Nervous Young Men, but after struggling to establish an audience, he decided to change tactics, choosing to try and release more experimental songs anonymously. Toledo chose the name \"Car Seat Headrest\" as he would often record the vocals to his early albums in the back seat of his car for privacy.\r\n\r\nThroughout the summer of 2010, Toledo released his first four albums under the Car Seat Headrest name: 1, 2, 3, and 4. 1 and 2 incorporated less traditional song structures, with stream-of-consciousness lyrics, whereas 3 and 4 would begin to cement his lo-fi indie rock style. Following the numbered albums, Toledo began attending classes at Virginia Commonwealth University, releasing the Sunburned Shirts EP during his first semester. The Sunburned Shirts EP would later be partially combined with his fifth LP, 5, to create his first titled album, My Back Is Killing Me Baby, released in March 2011. Songs culled from 5 would later appear on the b-sides compilation album Little Pieces of Paper with \"No\" Written on Them.\r\n\r\nAfter a difficult and lonely semester at VCU, Toledo transferred to the College of William & Mary, where he would release his next project, Twin Fantasy, a concept album centered on a relationship he was in at the time. Twin Fantasy would later be followed up by 2012\'s Monomania and Starving While Living EP.\r\n\r\nAround this time, Toledo began performing live shows with fellow students Katie Wood, Austin Ruhf, and Christian Northover, recording and releasing a short live album in July 2013 entitled Live at WCWM: Car Seat Headrest at the university\'s studio. Toledo would release his next project the following month; a two-hour long double album entitled Nervous Young Man. Three of the songs, and the title of the album, were taken from his original project, Nervous Young Men, but had been heavily reworked and re-recorded. Released alongside Nervous Young Man, for those who paid $5 or more, was the outtakes compilation album Disjecta Membra.\r\n\r\nToledo\'s final solo release was 2014\'s How to Leave Town, an hour long EP with heavy electronic instrumentation and more ambitious song structures.\r\n\r\n2015–2017: Matador Records, Teens of Style and Teens of Denial\r\nEthan Ives.\r\nIn September 2015, Car Seat Headrest announced on Facebook that he had signed an album deal with Matador Records. Toledo, who had recently graduated and moved to Seattle, recruited bassist Jacob Bloom and drummer Andrew Katz through Craigslist to record and tour his next album. In October 2015, Car Seat Headrest released the compilation album Teens of Style, their first to not be self-released exclusively via Bandcamp. Shortly after the album\'s release, Bloom left the group to attend medical school, and was replaced by bassist Ethan Ives.\r\n\r\nIves played bass throughout most of the recordings for the band\'s following release, but would later switch to guitar and other instruments, with Seth Dalby taking over on bass. Ives and Dalby were later cemented in these positions during live shows and future releases. The new album, created with traditional studio processes, Teens of Denial, was released on May 20, 2016. The album received universal acclaim, and brought the band a new wave of popularity.\r\n\r\nIn 2017, Car Seat Headrest released an alternate mix of their single, \"War Is Coming (If You Want It)\" through Bandcamp for one day, with profits going to the Transgender Law Center. The original mix of the track was released ten days later.\r\n\r\nOn December 13, 2017, the band released a re-recorded version of \"Beach Life-In-Death\", the second track on Twin Fantasy, through Spotify without prior announcement. This sparked fan rumors that the album would be re-recorded and released the following year. On December 27, 2017, an Amazon listing detailing a re-recorded version of Twin Fantasy was found by fans, and subsequently uploaded to the Car Seat Headrest subreddit. This was followed up by a listing on SRCVinyl.com with the date February 16, 2018. \r\n\r\n2018–2019: Twin Fantasy (Face to Face) and Commit Yourself Completely\r\nOn January 9, 2018, Matador Records formally announced the release of the re-recording, entitled Twin Fantasy (Face to Face), alongside a re-release of the original album. Twin Fantasy (Face to Face) was released via Matador on February 16. The original, which has been re-titled Twin Fantasy (Mirror to Mirror), was released on vinyl as a part of Record Store Day on April 21. On February 15, 2018, the band released a cover of \"Fallen Horses\" by Smash Mouth, who returned the favor by covering \"Something Soon\". Around the same time, they began touring with fellow Seattle-based band, Naked Giants, as a part of the group\'s expanded live lineup.\r\n\r\nIn August 2018, when asked about new material, Toledo confirmed that he was “demoing out stuff in Ableton,” adding “there might be some stuff that surprises people who only know us as a rock band, but I don’t think it will come as a surprise to people who are checking out all the deep cuts.” In January 2019, Andrew Katz confirmed the band was recording new music through a video uploaded on Instagram.\r\n\r\nFollowing the tease of new music, the band began experimenting with new material at various live shows in December 2018, debuting the tracks \"Weightlifters\", \"Hollywood\", \"Stop Lying To Me\", and \"You Know There\'s Someone Out There\", soon followed by \"Can\'t Cool Me Down\" in February and March 2019 performances. All were officially released on the next album except for \"Stop Lying To Me\" and \"You Know There\'s Someone Out There\".\r\n\r\nOn June 12, 2019, Car Seat Headrest announced a new live album titled Commit Yourself Completely, featuring official recordings of performances from the Twin Fantasy tour from 2018. It was released the following week on June 17.\r\n\r\n2020–present: Making a Door Less Open\r\nOn February 26, 2020, Car Seat Headrest announced their first studio album consisting of wholly new material since 2016\'s Teens of Denial, Making a Door Less Open. This announcement coincided with the release of \"Can\'t Cool Me Down\", the first single and second track off the album, and a release date of May 1, 2020. It marks a stylistic divergence from previous material, Toledo describing the album as containing elements of EDM, hip hop, futurism, doo-wop, soul and rock and roll. Three more singles were released to promote the album between March and April of that year: \"Martin\", \"Hollywood\" and \"There Must Be More Than Blood\". The release also coincided with the introduction of Trait, an alternative persona of Toledo\'s, featured prominently wearing a modified gas mask with blinking LED lights for eyes. The character had originally been created for the group\'s \"comedic\" side project, 1 Trait Danger, featuring Toledo alongside drummer Andrew Katz.\r\n\r\nMaking a Door Less Open was released with three separate versions across different formats: vinyl, CD and streaming, each with variations in track-list and specific musical elements. The album received a mixed reaction from fans, which pointed out the many divergences from the band\'s previous works, but received an overall score of 77 on review aggregate site Metacritic. Toledo noted that he and the band were working on a companion album for their latest release, while also looking for ways to improve the Trait mask to incorporate it into live performances.\r\n\r\nStyle\r\nAllMusic biographer Mark Deming wrote that Car Seat Headrest created \"moody and introspective lo-fi pop tunes that are melodic but structurally ambitious at once.\" Writing for Pitchfork, Jeremy Gordon stated that on Teens of Denial, \"Will Toledo reaffirms that he is ahead of the pack as an imaginative singer-songwriter, capable of crafting dynamic indie rock.\" Ian Cohen of Pitchfork also described Toledo\'s music as \"dense, confounding music that most often captures the giddy thrill of having access to recording equipment, of finally put a sound to the voice in your head.\"\r\n\r\nCar Seat Headrest\'s influences include Radiohead, Pink Floyd, the Beatles, the Beach Boys, Daniel Johnston, Destroyer, Kendrick Lamar, Frank Ocean, Leonard Cohen, of Montreal, Modest Mouse, Neutral Milk Hotel, Sufjan Stevens, Swans, They Might Be Giants, Why?, R.E.M., the Who, Nirvana, the Blackout, Neil Diamond, William Onyeabor, the Clash, the Cars, James Brown, DEVO, Queen, Rod Stewart, and Green Day. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Car+Seat+Headrest\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Originally signed to Gee, the group released its first single, \"You Baby You,\" late in 1955; an up-tempo doo wop song, the record became a regional hit. \"Little Girl of Mine,\" the Cleftones\' second single, broke nationally, charting at number eight R&B and number 57 pop in 1956; two other similar singles, \"Can\'t We Be Sweethearts\" and \"String Around My Heart,\" were released the same year, yet they failed to attract national attention. \"See You Next Year,\" a ballad the group recorded in 1957, did not earn the group an audience outside of New York. Two years later, McClain left the group and was replaced by Gene Pearson from the Rivileers. Patricia Spann was also added to the Cleftones\' lineup that year, which helped nudge the band away from traditional group-oriented doo wop harmonies and towards a vocal sound that was dominated by the lead vocals. In 1961, the Cleftones realized the potential of the sound with their smash hit version of the standard \"Heart and Soul;\" it became the group\'s biggest hit, reaching number 18 on both pop and R&B charts. Later that year, the group had another hit with \"For Sentimental Reasons,\" but the band had reached a peak with \"Heart and Soul\" and were never able to reach those heights again.

During the course of their existence, they had various lineup changes, with the Gallagher brothers remaining the only staple members.\r\n\r\nOasis signed to independent record label Creation Records in 1993 and released their record-setting debut album Definitely Maybe (1994).

Spending ten weeks at number one on the UK Albums Chart, (What\'s the Story) Morning Glory? was also an international chart success and became one of the best-selling albums of all time. In addition, it stands as the fifth-best-selling album in the UK and the biggest-selling album in the UK of the 1990s.

It was a cozy place, filled with blue-collar workers who made their living on the water. During the weekends, many of those workers would head over to the Osborne household, where a series of loose, all-night jam sessions filled the Maryland air with the sounds of Bob Seger, Hank Williams, Tom Petty and George Jones.\r\n\r\nThe Osborne siblings strummed their first chords during those jam sessions. From the very start, TJ Osborne was the brother with the voice. He sang in a thick, low baritone, crooning like Johnny Cash long before he was even old enough to drive. Older brother John, on the other hand, was the family’s guitar shredder, his fingers capable of down-home bluegrass licks, arena-worthy rock riffs, country twang, and everything in between. Combined, the two Osbornes could play everything from traditional country music to rock & roll, creating a broad, full-bodied sound that would eventually fill the 11 songs on their major-label debut, Pawn Shop.\r\n\r\nLike its title suggests, Pawn Shop offers a little bit of everything. There’s bluesy slide guitar, country duets, southern rock solos, harmonies, and plenty of groove. The hooks are big, the guitars are loud, and the songs — every last one of them co-written by the Osbornes, who reached out to award-winning songwriters like Shane McAnally and Ross Copperman for help — introduce a duo whose music bridges the gap between the mainstream and the alternative world. Some songs were written at home in Nashville, while others came together on the road, where the guys spent several years headlining their own club shows, touring the country with Darius Rucker, and playing some of the biggest arenas in America with fellow rule-breaker Eric Church.\r\n\r\n“Most duos are built on singing,” says TJ “But John is an incredible guitar player, and this band is built on me singing and John playing guitar. It gives us two parallels that work nicely together.”\r\n\r\n“It’s like an old-school rock approach,” adds John, who cites classic bands like Aerosmith and the Allman Brothers as influences on the duo’s dynamic. “Groups like that always had the lead singer as well as the sideman guitar player. That’s what we’re going for, too. We’re carving our own path in country music.”\r\n\r\nThat unique path has already led the band toward the upper half of the country charts. “Rum” got them there first, mixing the feel-good sunshine of a beach tune with a far more realistic storyline. There’s no actual beach in “Rum,” after all. Instead, Brothers Osborne turn the song into a tribute to the simple pleasures that their Maryland hometown offers: friends, good weather, and the occasional drink. They even filmed the song’s music video in Deale, filling the clip with footage of friends, relatives, and locals.\r\n\r\n“Most people we grew up with don’t go to these beautiful beaches,” says TJ. “They can’t afford to do it. They don’t have the time for it. What we’re most familiar with is people going to the local bars and hanging out with each other.” John adds, “We tried to have the biggest time possible with what little we had. ‘Rum’ explains that.” The brothers agree, “We had to say it from our own perspective.”\r\n\r\nA similar theme runs throughout “Dirt Rich” and “Pawn Shop,” two songs that stress the importance of appreciating what you’ve got. Pawn Shop dishes up plenty of love songs, too, from “Loving Me Back” — an old-school country duet featuring vocals from Lee Ann Womack — to “Stay a Little Longer,” the band’s biggest hit to date. While a three-minute guitar solo brings “Stay a Little Longer” to an epic, anthemic close, Brothers Osborne also devote time to more laid-back songs, from the nostalgic California country of “21 Summer” to the 420-friendly “Greener Pastures.”\r\n\r\nBrothers Osborne, who co-produced the album with Jay Joyce (the award-winning producer behind Little Big Town’s Painkiller, Eric Church’s The Outsiders, and Carrie Underwood’s Storyteller), recorded most of Pawn Shop during breaks in their busy touring schedule, using members of their own touring band rather than session musicians from the Nashville community. The result is an album that’s stamped with the unmistakable mark of a band. It doesn’t sound like two singers, flanked by anonymous players. Instead, it sounds like a group of road warriors who’ve spent years sharing bus seats and hotel rooms, creating the sort of chemistry that can’t be faked. Pawn Shop is both raw and real, and Brothers Osborne — who, years after those household jam sessions in Deale, now have a handful of nationwide tours under their belts, songs on the charts, and a career on the rise — are no longer a family secret. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Brothers+Osborne\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The group disbanded in 2010 due to each member matriculating at different colleges, deeming it impractical to continue making music for the majority of the year. McLaughlin and Imbusch left the band, met Stone and Cohen at their respective colleges, and decided to add them to the band. Thus forming The Rare Occasions. McLaughlin came up with the name after the band went through an \"identity crisis,\" eventually settling on \"The Rare Occasions\" instead of \"The Custodians,\" which they previously went by.\r\n\r\nShortly after the release of their first album Into The Shallows, lead guitarist Peter Stone left the band amicably, leading to the band becoming a 3-piece.\r\n\r\nBand later relocated from Boston, Massachusetts to Los Angeles, California, where they recorded their second album.\r\n\r\nTheir first release was the Demo Recordings EP, released on October 12, 2012, followed by Applefork in 2013. Three studio albums have been released to date, Into the Shallows (2018), Big Whoop (2021), and Through Moonshot Eyes (2024).\r\n\r\nStyle\r\n\r\nThe Rare Occasions was described as a garage rock indie rock band. The EP Futureproof introduced experimentation – string arrangements and woodwind instruments, suggested by Imbusch and vocal harmonies. 2021 album Big Whoop featured Wall of Sound guitars, electronic landscapes and further orchestral arrangements; McLaughlin\'s lyrics are sometimes philosophical and often deal with existentialism.\r\n\r\nMembers\r\n\r\nCurrent members\r\nBrian McLaughlin – lead vocals, guitars, keyboards (2012–present)\r\nJeremy Cohen – bass guitar, guitars, backing vocals (2012–present)\r\nLuke Imbusch – drums, percussion, backing vocals (2012–present)\r\n\r\nPast members\r\nPeter Stone – guitars, backing vocals (2012–2018)\r\n\r\nDiscography\r\n\r\nAlbums\r\nInto the Shallows (2018)\r\nBig Whoop (2021)\r\nThrough Moonshot Eyes (2024) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Rare+Occasions\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Touring worldwide, Springer was a featured artist at the 1988 World’s Fair in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, performing with the Trinidad Calypso Band. Upon returning to the United States, Springer joined Hugh Borde’s world famous Trinidad Tripoli Steel Band, performing and recording with them for over ten years.

The band consists of three sisters: Este Haim (bass guitar and vocals), Danielle Haim (lead vocals, guitar, and drums), and Alana Haim (guitars, keyboards, and vocals). In addition to their primary instruments, each member is proficient in several others. The group\'s pop sound on their studio work stands in contrast to the more rock-based music of their live shows. Most frequently compared to Fleetwood Mac, HAIM\'s sound has been described as \"nu-folk-meets-nineties-R&B\" (by the BBC)  and \"music that sounds like it was written on a lakeside retreat attended by Stevie Nicks, John Waite and En Vogue\" (by the Guardian newspaper).\r\n\r\nThe sisters grew up in a musical family, and began playing instruments from an early age in the cover band Rockinhaim, fronted by their parents, Moti and Donna. The two elder sisters, Este and Danielle, began performing with the pop group \"Valli Girls\" in 2005. They released a few songs on soundtrack and compilation albums under that name, but left the group shortly after an appearance at the 2005 Nickelodeon Kids\' Choice Awards. They formed Haim with younger sister Alana in 2007, but did not seriously consider it a professional career for some years. After Danielle became a successful touring guitarist, first with Jenny Lewis and later with Julian Casablancas, Haim reformed as a full-time operation in 2012.\r\n\r\nThe group\'s first release, Forever EP (an EP released as a limited-time download), combined with positive reception at the South by Southwest festival, led to a deal with Polydor Records and a management deal with Jay-Z\'s Roc Nation group in mid-2012. The band began recording material for their first album, Days Are Gone, in sessions between touring dates, including appearances at the Glastonbury Festival. The album charted in the top ten in several countries, including the number-one spot in the UK, and the group had won several \"best of\" awards by the end of 2013. The group was nominated for Best New Artist at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards. Their second album, Something to Tell You, was released in July 2017. Their third album, titled Women in Music Pt. III, was released on June 26, 2020. The group received nominations at the 63rd Grammy awards for Album of the Year and Best Rock Performance (for \"The Steps\").\r\n\r\nIn 2024, the sisters blacked out the band\'s Instagram, seemingly teasing new music by putting \"writing... writing... writing...\" in the account\'s bio. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/HAIM\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

On that album, his first of five for the Warp label, Ellison distilled a uniquely crisp, spasmodic, and heady sound with elements of hip-hop, avant-garde jazz, IDM, and dubstep. While the abovementioned producers fueled Ellison, he had also been excited as a youngster by the \'90s West Coast rap classics that combined programming and live instrumentation. His sound continued to develop as he put his own twist on the approach, recording with a crop of jazz musicians including the indispensable likes of bassist Thundercat and strings master Miguel Atwood-Ferguson. This process began with the turbulent 2010 set Cosmogramma and peaked in terms of acclaim in 2014 with You\'re Dead!, which crashed the Top 20 of the Billboard 200 and spawned the Kendrick Lamar collaboration \"Never Catch Me,\" a Grammy nominee for Best Dance Recording. Ellison devoted a few years to various forms of film work and the operation of his revered Brainfeeder label, and returned in 2019 with Flamagra, his second consecutive album to top Billboard\'s Dance/Electronic chart. After he was Grammy-nominated for Producer of the Year, he provided the score for the 2021 anime series Yasuke.\r\n\r\nSteven Ellison was born in Los Angeles and raised in the city\'s Winnetka neighborhood. He is the grandson of Marilyn McLeod, a songwriter and producer known for co-writing hits such as Diana Ross\' \"Love Hangover\" and Jermaine Jackson\'s \"Let Me Tickle Your Fancy.\" Additionally, Ellison is the grand-nephew of visionary jazz artists Alice Coltrane (McLeod\'s sister) and John Coltrane. His cousins include Ravi and Oran Coltrane, the latter of whom introduced him to electronic music production and gave him his first piece of gear, a Roland MC-505 groovebox. Drawn first to filmmaking -- he made stop-motion clips in his youth, using action figures and a camcorder -- Ellison obtained a degree from Los Angeles Film School and continued at the Academy of Art in San Francisco. After a short period in the Bay Area, he returned to L.A. and in 2004 started working as an intern for Peanut Butter Wolf\'s Stones Throw label, which enabled him to cross paths with inspirations such as J Dilla and Madlib. All the while, Ellison had continued to work on music, particularly taken with the Akai MPC sampler. In response to an open call from Cartoon Network\'s Adult Swim programming block, Ellison submitted tracks, and soon had them licensed for use between segments and commercial breaks.\r\n\r\nEllison debuted officially as Flying Lotus in 2006, the year he connected with Plug Research, a crucial outlet of Los Angeles\' emerging beat scene. His \"Two Bottom Blues\" appeared beside tracks by established contemporaries such as Daedelus, Sa-Ra, and Georgia Anne Muldrow on Carlos Niño Presents the Sound of L.A. A couple months later, he provided a remix for Mia Doi Todd\'s La Ninja: Amor and Other Dreams. That October, Plug Research released 1983, Ellison\'s first album. Titled after his birth year, it was created in solitude with the exception of the cosmic \"Unexpected Delight,\" featuring vocals from Laura Darlington -- a frequent collaborator for years to come. Signal-boosting support came most prominently from BBC DJ Gilles Peterson. The next year, U.K. underground institution Warp Records signed Ellison and issued the Reset EP -- another October delivery -- on which Ellison\'s sound became more distinct. This time, Andreya Triana joined Ellison on the woozy opener \"Tea Leaf Dancers,\" a signature early track.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Ellison had become a major catalyst in the activity emanating from Low End Theory, a weekly club night -- and public salon of sorts for aspiring beatmakers and other musicians -- held in L.A.\'s Lincoln Heights neighborhood. Local groundswell and an increasing international profile combined to make Ellison\'s first Warp LP a subcultural event. The definitively titled Los Angeles arrived in June 2008, entered Billboard\'s Dance/Electronic Albums chart at number 16, and months later was hailed by several music publications as one of the year\'s best albums. Ellison incorporated vocals from Laura Darlington, Gonjasufi, and Dolly, but he also received co-production input from fellow native Californians and L.A. transplants. Three of them -- Gaslamp Killer, Samiyam, and MatthewDavid -- soon helped build the catalog of Ellison\'s Brainfeeder label, launched the same year and named after the opening track of Los Angeles. By August 2009, Warp had also dispersed L.A. EP 1 X 3, L.A. EP 2 X 3, and L.A. EP 3 X 3, a trilogy of short-form releases containing previously unreleased cuts and remixes. One of the remixes came from eventual Brainfeeder artist Martyn, affirming Ellison\'s enthusiastic tracking of pre-commercial dubstep. Around that time, Ellison also remixed a Martyn production and made his first in a handful of appearances on the Hyperdub label.\r\n\r\nOne of many formative inspirations for Ellison was West Coast rap -- G-funk especially -- that integrated programming and live instrumentation. For the producer\'s next album, he took the concept to the hilt, albeit with a result that moved him closer to modern electric avant-garde jazz than to lowrider classics. Released in May 2010, Cosmogramma was a turning point for Ellison, made with instrumentalists such as bassist and vocalist Thundercat, violinist and arranger Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, harpist Rebekah Raff, and Ellison\'s cousin, tenor saxophonist Ravi Coltrane. Darlington, Niki Randa, and Radiohead\'s Thom Yorke also provided vocals on one track each. Just as significantly, Ellison incorporated sounds from medical equipment recorded in the hospital room of his mother, who died just before the album began to take shape. Even though the placement of those recordings isn\'t as obvious as, say, a Thundercat bassline, heavy-hearted sentiments were made evident throughout. Cosmogramma reached number three on the Dance/Electronic Albums chart and was the first Flying Lotus LP to hit the Billboard 200, registering at number 88. The supplemental Pattern+Grid World EP was out a few months later.\r\n\r\nUntil the Quiet Comes, the dreamlike fourth Flying Lotus album, was out in September 2012. Spacier and pared down in relation to Cosmogramma, it still found room for the likes of Thundercat, other Brainfeeder affiliates including keyboardists Austin Peralta and Brandon Coleman, and Atwood-Ferguson. Darlington, Randa, and Yorke likewise added ghostly vocals, as did Erykah Badu. It cracked the Top 40 of the Billboard 200, peaking at number 34, and narrowly missed the top of the Dance/Electronic chart. Ellison then bolted in the opposite direction and reached a new level of acclaim with his next work. You\'re Dead!, released in October 2014, used many of the players familiar to Flying Lotus sessions -- plus Herbie Hancock, rising Brainfeeder addition Kamasi Washington, and Snoop Dogg, as well as Ellison under his rapping Captain Murphy guise -- and multiplied the intensity. The thrashing LP scraped the Top 20 of the Billboard 200 and topped Dance/Electronic Albums. \"Never Catch Me,\" featuring Kendrick Lamar, was nominated for a Grammy in the category of Best Dance Recording. Ellison had co-produced \"Wesley\'s Theory\" for Lamar\'s To Pimp a Butterfly, a contender for Album of the Year, making him a two-time nominee.\r\n\r\nBrainfeeder inevitably branched into film production, beginning with the biological horror-comedy vignette Royal and the 2017 parent feature Kuso, both directed by (and featuring music from) Ellison. Additionally, Flying Lotus was the name credited with the music for the short Blade Runner Black Out 2022, among some other visual projects that reached the public in the mid- to late 2010s. Ellison ended the longest period between Flying Lotus albums in May 2019 with Flamagra. Put together over the intervening years, it threw Brainfeeder signee George Clinton, Solange, Anderson .Paak, Shabazz Palaces, and Tierra Whack, among several other guests, into the mix. A central role was played by director David Lynch, who spun a tale about an inferno threatening to engulf a neighborhood. Flamagra became the second Flying Lotus LP to top the Dance/Electronic Albums chart, and debuted on the Billboard 200 at number 45. He continued to work closely with Thundercat on the bassist\'s 2020 release It Is What It Is; it won a Grammy for Best Progressive R&B Album, and the same year, Ellison was among the nominees for Producer of the Year, Non-Classical. Returning to film work, Ellison composed the soundtrack to the 2021 Netflix anime series Yasuke, based on a 16th century Black samurai. \"The Room,\" a neo-soul single featuring singer Devin Tracy, appeared in 2022.\r\n\r\nBiography by  Andy Kellman <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Flying+Lotus\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

He\'d been writing music and making albums since he was 15, and by the age of 26, he felt like he was spinning his wheels. He knew he needed a change, so he ended his old band Sequoyah Prep School and moved to Cuba. He thought he might be done with music for a while, but the songs just kept coming.\r\n\r\n\"I had this idea in my mind that I was going to try and join some kind of Latin American Leftist movement. I wanted to jump off a cliff,\" Osborne says. \"Once I got there I immediately started hanging out with musicians and going to shows. I started showing them the songs from this project that was kind of just an idea in my head.\r\n\r\n\"They were like, \'man, don\'t throw away your passport, go home and continue to make music,\'\" he says. \"I was encouraged by them to try again.\"\r\n\r\nOsborne was already writing the songs for what would be SUSTO\'s 2014 self-titled debut when his producer Wolfgang Zimmerman introduced him to Johnny Delaware, a guitarist and songwriter who had moved to Charleston, South Carolina to make an album with the producer.\r\n\r\nSUSTO is a Spanish word referring to a folk illness in Latin America that Osborne learned as anthropology student, meaning “when your soul is separated from your body,” and also roughly translates to a panic attack. For Osborne, the music of SUSTO was something he had to get out into the world.\r\n\r\nSUSTO released their debut album independently and toured relentlessly to get the word out. They were an immediate hit in their hometown, packing venues, getting airplay at all the bars and even making a fan of Band of Horses\' Ben Bridwell. \"I got an e-mail from him, telling me he loved the record and wanted to meet with me and Johnny,\" he says. \"That was actually the day I wrote my professor, and I said, ‘I\'m not coming in.’\"\r\n\r\nThe members of the live band that Osborne and Delaware recruited — Corey Campbell (guitar, keys, backing vocals), Jenna Desmond (bass), and Marshall Hudson (drums, percussion) contributed to SUSTO’s new album & I\'m Fine Today, which will be released via Caroline. \"We just wanted to go further. We started something with the first record, and we want to keep going in that direction,\" Osborne says of the album, which finds them taking the spacey country rock of their debut into the stratosphere, piling on layers of sighing keyboards, galloping rhythms and frayed, noisy guitar solos atop wistful melodies and lyrics that examine growing up and growing into yourself. “We put the first record out, and we worked hard, and it just feels like a good place to be,” he says, noting that while the first record focused on his own struggles, & I\'m Fine Today is more concerned with looking at the world beyond the struggles in your head. \r\n\r\n“I’ve learned to appreciate the fact that I just get to be here. It’s all perspective,” he says. “This album is about coming to terms with yourself and feeling okay with your place in the universe.\" <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Susto\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Unlike most guitar/bass/drum bands, Wombo often uses the bass to carry their melodies, while the guitar adds texture, color, and abstraction, exploring the musical space as they navigate tunes that are ambitious and engaging. They started out at their most bold on the 2017 EP Staring at Trees, with elements of prog, psychedelia, and noise rock prominent in the mix, and their approach showed greater focus on 2020\'s Blossomlooksdownuponus. With 2022\'s Fairy Rust, the group added just enough precision and polish to let their pop influences shine with their more challenging ideas intact.\r\n\r\nWombo was formed in 2016 by lead singer and bassist Sydney Chadwick and guitarist Cameron Lowe. Chadwick and Lowe had previously been members of an angular punk-pop band called the Debauchees, and when that band called it quits, they recruited drummer Joel Taylor and made their live debut in August 2016. The band was making a name for themselves in the Louisville independent music community when they released their first recordings, a seven-song EP titled Staring at Trees that they self-released on cassette in July 2017. They continued to hone their eclectic approach with live work, headlining small shows and touring with the Nude Party, White Denim, and Dehd, and after striking a deal with the independent Fire Talk label, they brought out their first full-length album, Blossomlooksdownuponus. The band had extensive touring planned in support of the LP, but like many musicians, they were grounded by the COVID-19 pandemic, and they used their abundant free time to write and arrange fresh material. Wombo offered a progress report of their musical adventures with a four-song EP, Keesh Mountain, initially released on cassette in May 2021, With a set of songs that often touched on myth, imagination, and the unconscious, Wombo set to work on their second album, recorded in eight days by Nick Roeder and mixed by Dave Vettraino. The finished product, Fairy Rust, was issued by Fire Talk in July 2022.\r\n\r\nBiography by Mark Deming for ALLMUSIC <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Wombo\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Initially known for his remixes of artists like Jessie Ware, he released his debut EP, Shivers, in 2015. Collaborations with vocalists such as Gallant, Ray BLK, and Bishop Nehru followed, and Lewis released Dusk, the first EP in a three-part series dedicated to club culture, in 2018.\r\n\r\nA native of Reading, England, Lewis first became interested in music in his teens and played in several bands before he started experimenting with remixing tracks.

He quickly built a loyal following, and eventually nabbed a residency DJ\'ing at London\'s Chibuku Club.\r\n\r\nIn 2014, his remix of Jessie Ware\'s song \"You & I (Forever)\" caught the attention of Ware\'s label, PMR Records, who then signed him.

The band launched with promising EPs in 2009 and 2001, and exploded with the 2013 album Am, which helped the band become a popular under-the-radar alternative to the polished emo scene of the time. Soon afterward, however, the band cracked under the pressure, both internally and externally, and Hartlett formed the band Stove. The break didn\'t last long, though, and Ovlov returned to the fray in 2018 with their second album of guitar heroics and melancholy, TRU.\r\n\r\nAs youngsters in Connecticut, Hartlett, his brothers Theo and Jon, and various friends played together in the band Home Movies in the mid-2000s, but when he grew tired of that he started Ovlov. With a fluctuating lineup based around Hartlett and his songs, the group began playing shows and in 2009, released the Crazy Motorcycle Jump EP. Featured on that release were Hartlett\'s brother Theo on drums, Dave Berliner on bass, and Quentin Ham on guitar. The band\'s gnarly guitar work and heartfelt emo-meets-indie sound caught on, thanks in no small part to the efforts of Greg Horbal of The World Is a Beautiful Place and I Am No Longer Afraid to Die in getting the word about them out. Their next release, the 2011 What\'s So Great About the City EP, had Michael Falcone on drums and a guest appearance by Speedy Ortiz\'s Sadie Dupuis on vocals. The revolving cast of players spun again as they began recording their first album, this time putting Theo back in the drum seat and third Hartlett brother Jon on bass. The trio recorded the album quickly with Michael John Thomas III of Green Is Green helping out and Dupuis guesting again on vocals. Hartlett and Thomas then traded the tapes back and forth for six months, tweaking things until they were happy with the result. By then, the band had signed with the Brooklyn label Exploding in Sound and Am was issued in July of 2013. Soon afterward, the lineup changed again and Jon Hartlett left the band. They recruited old friend Michael \"Boner\" Hammond, Jr. to play bass and Morgan Luzzi to play guitar, then recorded a song, \"The Great Crocodile,\" for a 2014 split single with the band Little Big League and another, \"Ohmu Shell,\" for a single with LVL UP, Krill, and Radiator Hospital. The band continued playing with Hartlett writing songs, but they broke up in early 2015 before they could record another album.\r\n\r\nHartlett rebounded with Stove, whose first album, 2015\'s Is Stupider, not surprisingly featured Hartlett playing all the instruments himself. The lineup expanded for live shows and further recordings, like the 2016 EP Is a Toad in the Rain. Around the time of that EP, Ovlov reformed with the same members as when they split and began working on another album. With a mix of songs written for the record, some played live but never recorded and some taken from demos made before Ovlov had even formed, TRU saw the band working with Michael John Thomas III again in Brooklyn. The record was released by Exploding in Sound in mid-2018. ~ Tim Sendra\r\n\r\n2) Ovlov is also a three piece rock band from Brescia, Italy.\r\nLù Pangra (vocals, guitar) and Luigi Ancellotti (bass) had played together in Black Eyed Susan and formed Ovlov with drummer Michele Marelli.

After all, even escapism acknowledges there’s something to escape from, and at times – like many who’ve grown up in Tel Aviv – Erez has wanted to shut herself off from a world rendered beyond comprehension by forces beyond her control. But if there’s one thing Erez isn’t – and sometimes it’s easier to say what artists as complex and fresh as her aren’t than are – it’s naïve. And what this means is simple: her work reflects the manner in which she’s learned to live. As she puts it, “I have this idea of giving people moments of thought and inspiration, and at the same time offering escapism and fun.\"\r\n\r\nIt’s not the easiest of goals, but few succeed as well as Erez. While the music she makes in collaboration with her partner and co-writer, composer and producer Ori Rousso, exploits many of the more physical, dynamic elements of electronic music, it also embraces a cerebral sensitivity that’s made her one of her home city’s most exciting, idiosyncratic artists. As inspired by Björk, M.I.A. and fka Twigs as by Flying Lotus, Kendrick Lamar and Frank Ocean, the grainy textures and potent atmospheres forged with her synths and ingenious beats bravely straddle genres, energised further by the environment in which she’s grown up.\r\n\r\nConsequently, another of Erez’ goals is, as she puts it, “to process the world, and deliver ideas on how to process it. If you\'re able to create a musical context that captures the state you were in when you were writing it, that can potentially bring someone closer to understanding their own world.” In her case, this means articulating the fierce anger that lies behind the hypnotically percussive “Dance While You Shoot”, about the realisation that “you can’t live without the government that ensures your basic needs, but at the same time takes your money, keeps you in the dark about the real, important matters that affect your life directly, while drowning you in manipulative media, ignorance and bureaucracy.”\r\n\r\nThen there’s the edgy “Pity”, provoked by a court case concerning a gang rape filmed on phones and shared across the web. “We took it to a more day to day level of being a woman in a men’s world, the need to use your ‘feminine’ qualities to get around, and the borders that can be crossed while you try to do that.” And that’s not to mention the extraordinary grit of “Off The Radar”, which addresses contemporary fears of being anonymous or forgotten, and “our indecent urge to leave our mark by publicly sharing thoughts and ideas without due consideration, purely for the rush we get from approval and affirmation.”\r\n\r\nErez was born four days before 1990, the year the Gulf War started, and it would be impossible for her now, as an artist, to ignore what’s been going on around her all her life. Nonetheless, she admits that, for a while, she retreated from the highly politicised climate in which she was raised. “As I became more aware of everything going on – the complexity of the situation, and how it affects lives on both sides – my reaction was to separate myself from it. I got rid of my TV and stopped consuming news completely.”\r\n\r\nShe found sanctuary in music, but withdrawal is rarely permanent, and if there’s tension in Erez’ work – and there’s plenty, as it happens – then it’s an acknowledgement of this simple truth. “Most of the time it\'s easy just to ignore what’s happening, but every now and then reality makes that impossible.” Erez is, however, thoroughly self-aware, and acknowledges how “we are very lucky not to live near the borders, not to be at the wrong place at the wrong time, and to have shelters and technology protecting us. But with this sense of luck comes a sense of guilt for being able to do something like make music while lives are being taken.”\r\n\r\nUncompromising and unpredictable, sophisticated and bold, Noga Erez is clear about her ambitions. “Our way of trying to keep in contact with our feelings and fears, and of avoiding emotional detachment about everything, is music. Human beings can come from completely different places but share a fundamental basis of emotions. In my opinion, music is the form of art or communication that expresses that most accurately.” The conversation starts now. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Noga+Erez\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Because each of the tracks boasts a different lineup of musicians, the album maintains a sense of spontaneity — one highlight of which is saxophonist Shoko Igarashi’s vibrant solo on “Simple Affairs”— and the decision to shuffle those different lineups across the album’s tracklist makes the whole thing feel irresistibly freewheeling.\r\n\r\nAll of these wild sonic directions are held together by Brussels-based singer Clément, who effortlessly delivers earworm after earworm, regardless of which group of musicians is playing behind her. Drifting between English and French, her elastic delivery is a constant surprise — whether it’s her tumbling wordplay on “Sweet Tooth,” the luxurious funk of “We’re Lost,” or the stunningly warm “Hit Me Now,” which feels like a lost Yo La Tengo classic. God’s Trashmen Sent To Right The Mess is a marvelous debut, with countless thrilling musical flights of fancy, and a rock-solid partnership at its core. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Fievel+Is+Glauque\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The group currently consists of lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Awsten Knight, backing vocalist and guitarist Geoff Wigington, and drummer Otto Wood.\r\n\r\nThe band has released three EPs, two of which (Airplane Conversations & Black Light)  were released independently with one released via Equal Vision (Cluster). Additionally, the band has released five studio albums (Double Dare, Entertainment, FANDOM, Greatest Hits and INTELLECUAL PROPERTY).\r\n\r\nOn November 6, 2015, the band signed with Equal Vision Records. After searching for producers, the band became managed by Benji Madden and Joel Madden. On November 6, 2015, the band released \"Crave\", the lead single off their first project with Equal Vision, the Cluster EP. On January 15, 2016, the group released Cluster, which was co-produced by Benji Madden and Courtney Ballard, with bass being performed by Mikey Way of My Chemical Romance. On November 19, 2015, the band performed with Good Charlotte during the group\'s comeback performance at The Troubadour in West Hollywood, California.\r\n\r\nThe group performed on the Black Cat Tour supporting Never Shout Never in 2016, and on every date of the 2016 Warped Tour. The band also performed on the End The Madness Tour supporting Sleeping with Sirens in late 2016. They played Slam Dunk festival in 2016 and 2017, and went on a headline tour of the UK with support from Chapel and The Bottom Line, selling out all dates. They toured the US in late 2017, with support from As It Is, Chapel and Sleep On It.\r\n\r\nThe group released a single titled \"Stupid For You\" on August 31, 2016 in promotion of their debut album, Double Dare, which was released on November 4, 2016. The album consists of 13 songs, and was preceded by 3 singles: \"Stupid For You\"; \"Hawaii (Stay Awake)\"; and \"Royal\". On January 26, 2017, the band released their second studio album Entertainment. The album includes 10 tracks, and was preceded by the singles \"Blonde\", \"Lucky People\", and \"Not Warriors\". \r\n\r\nYou write a record, go on tour, endure a very public breakup, and pen more songs about what happened. Sound familiar? Well, this story sort of starts that way right before it makes a total 180 degree turn on a dime. \r\n...\r\nRather than talk about “doing something different\", Waterparks actually did. On the heels of landing their biggest chart and critical success to date on 2018’s Entertainment, the Houston, TX three piece - Awsten Knight [vocals, guitar], Otto Wood [drums], and Geoff Wigington [guitar] commenced writing again before scrapping everything. They reconfigured the vision, recalibrated the entire approach, and reinvented themselves. By doing so, the boys boldly break down walls between rock, pop, punk, hip-hop, alternative, indie, electronic, and even R&B with hashtaggable hooks and a level of gleeful playlist hopping mischief on their third full length, and Hopeless Records debut, FANDOM.  They went on the FANDOM Tour in 2019 and 2020, before the rest of the tour being cancelled. However, they recorded one of the shows, and released their first live album, FANDOM: LIVE IN THE UK in late 2020. \r\n                                                                                                                                    \r\nThen on September 25, 2020, the band released their first single since FANDOM, \"Lowkey as Hell\", and announced they had signed to 300 Entertainment. Then, on February 26, 2021, they released \"Snow Globe\", and announced their fourth studio album, Greatest Hits. Four additional singles preceded the album\'s release: \"Numb\", \"You\'d Be Paranoid Too (If Everyone Was Out To Get You)\", \"Just Kidding\", and  \"Violet!\". And on May 21, 2021, Greatest Hits was released. They reinvented themselves once again, making an album with influences from genres like hyperpop, pop, hip-hop, rock, punk, alternative, indie and even electronic and r&b. Since then, Greatest Hits has topped charts, gotten 25 million streams and and has led the band to perform on MTV. Waterparks has also started touring again, doing meet and greet shows in places like LA, NYC, Orlando, Baltimore, Houston, Seattle, Portland and Minneapolis. They also went on the A Night Out on Earth tour in fall 2021 across America with Zeph, Phem and Arrested Youth as openers.\r\n\r\nThen, they started teasing new music. Awsten started an online clothing brand called Hii-Def. Then on March 9th, it was announced that the band was going on tour opening for My Chemical Romance on five dates  (Albany, Montreal, Toronto on two nights, Los Angeles).  Later that month, they announced they were going to play Sad Summer Fest from July 8th till August 5th across America with bands like State Champs, Mayday Parade, Hot Mulligan, Neck Deep and more. Then, in May they announced they had signed to Fueled by Ramen. Following that, they released the 1st single off of their fifth studio album, entitled FUNERAL GREY on May 14th, 2022.\r\n\r\nDuring June, they went on the See You in The Future tour in Europe with Bad Suns and Phem as openers. They then went on the Sad Summer fest and released SELF-SABOTAGE on July 7, 2022, the same day as the 1st show of SSF in Sacramento. A week after starting the SSF tour, they announced they were opening for Blackbear’s Nothing Matters tour in September. On October 14th, 2022, they released FUCK ABOUT IT (feat. blackbear), the third single off their fifth studio album. On November 22, they announced the title of their fifth album, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. On January 26th, 2023, they released the fourth single from INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, REAL SUPER DARK, and announced that their fifth album would be released on April 14, 2023.

Tora is an alias of 虹釜太郎, Japanese experimental artist who released on Shi-Ra-Nui (不知火)\r\n\r\n3. TORA FISHER – SPILLING OVER (2012 BIO)\r\n“Tora displays the depth to rally the masses with keenly written lyrics\r\nand expressive vocals.” —Billboard\r\n\r\nNew York City singer/songwriter Tora Fisher found her voice -and salvation- through heartache and loss. After all, it’s not many people who like Tora, walk away as the sole survivor of a tragic plane crash. In her debut CD, SPILLING OVER, a passionate ode to these very themes, Tora explores these feelings track by track and word by word, having written or co-written all the songs on the album, and delivering something that is nothing short of highly personal and intensely moving, a passionate song cycle that explores the emotions which emanate from the very depths of the human soul.\r\n\r\nProduced by Tora and Michael Mugrage, who also co-wrote several tracks on the CD, SPILLING OVER is set for release June 5th, 2012, via LML Music/Allegro.\r\n\r\n“This entire album is about men,” says Tora. “I guess I find that somewhat ironic because I’m such a strong independent woman who can provide for herself and in the process act like a father figure to many of my friends and family. But that’s probably why it dominates my art. In life I am all of the things a strong woman should be. In music, I’m just a fragile girl who’s had her heart broken by the men I’ve lost both in life and in love.”\r\n\r\nWith a powerful voice and edgy, eclectic style (not to mention those wordsmith prowesses) that bring to mind a combination of Tori Amos, Adele, Ann Wilson and Chrissie Hynde, twenty-two year old Tora Fisher is a musical force to be reckoned with. From songs such as “Dirty Secret” and “Summer Eyes” that explore a somewhat forbidden love to classic break-up/heartache songs such as “Nothing” and “For Dead”; from the soaring, anthemic qualities of “Finally Free” to dealing with post traumatic stress in “Own The Skies” to the emotions of seeing her father’s grave for the first time on “And I Won’t Cry” and “Second Tree From The Corner” (written when Tora was just thirteen), every track on Tora’s remarkable CD SPILLING OVER causes the listener to pause and think, contemplating the parallels between the songs they are hearing and their very own life experiences.\r\n\r\nAccompanying Tora on SPILLING OVER are stellar musicians Michael Mugrage (who also co-wrote several of the tracks on the album with Tora and produced the CD as well), Seth Glassman on Bass and Frank Vilardi on Drums. SPILLING OVER was written in New York City and recorded at Carriage House Studios and was a project a year in the making. Said Tora, “I called the album Spilling Over because I finally wrote about all the experiences I was trying to keep inside. Once I gave in to exposing myself on the record, all of the songs nearly exploded out of me. It can be scary to dig that deep but I knew it was the only way the music would be honest and meaningful…and hopefully, touch somebody.”\r\n\r\nAs the daughter of Broadway producers, Fisher spent her early years surrounded by music and the arts, her days filled with singing and dance lessons. Tora’s hard work landed her a coveted spot at the internationally renowned Interlochen Academy for the Arts’ summer session, several years in a row. She thrived in the creative environment and a young artist was blooming.\r\n\r\nLife took an unexpected and cruel turn when Tora was in an accident at thirteen years of age. A plane carrying Tora, her father, stepmother and four others crashed into the back of a sheet metal factory building Tora was the only survivor. Miraculously she walked herself out of the plane, and when Rescue arrived they found her standing in the snow nearly unscratched.\r\n\r\n“So many people expected me to crumble,” Tora admits. “I never once, in that plane, thought ‘How can I get through this?’ I simply pushed through that horrific day on raw instinct. But when the dust had settled, then I felt scared because the aches I felt were no longer from my body, but from the bottom of my soul. It was at that moment that I realized my real survival was dependent on music. With music, nothing ever dies. You just keep playing it and it lives again – that’s the magic of it. And so I needed to write music. It brought me joy and that’s all I knew and all I wanted to know,” says Tora. Shortly out of the hospital, she sat down at the piano and began to write songs to cope with the overwhelming loss, realizing that this would be the key to expressing herself and moving forward.\r\n\r\nTo avoid being surrounded by the life she once shared with those she had lost, Tora left New York for Connecticut, where she began studying at the illustrious Choate Rosemary Hall college-preparatory school. Despite feeling isolated at first from her classmates, she continued working hard, practicing piano and writing music to get her through. She would come to serve as lead in the school musical production, start her very own dance troupe, and even graduate with Cum Laude Society Honors.\r\n\r\nAfter graduation from Choate, Tora enrolled in Columbia University. Feeling artistically constricted, she took a leave from studies to focus on her music career. Within two short years she was signed with Chris Keaton Presents and began working on her new album. She has since performed aboard the USS Intrepid, had shows in New York and released her first single, “Man of Steel,” proceeds of which benefit veterans and their families (philanthropy being another of Tora’s passions).\r\n\r\n4.

In early 2016 the band members relocated to Nashville.\r\n\r\nThen Came the Morning, the second album by the Southern-born, Brooklyn-based indie-folk trio the Lone Bellow, opens with a crest of churchly piano, a patter of drums, and a fanfare of voices harmonizing like a sunrise. It’s a powerful introduction, enormous and overwhelming, as Zach Williams, Brian Elmquist, and Kanene Pipkin testify mightily to life’s great struggles and joys, heralding the morning that dispels the dark night: “Then came the morning! It was bright, like the light that you kept from your smile!” Working with producer Aaron Dessner of the National, the Lone Bellow has created a sound that mixes folk sincerity, gospel fervor, even heavy metal thunder, but the heart of the band is harmony: three voices united in a lone bellow. \r\n\r\n\"The feeling I get singing with Zach and Brian is completely natural and wholly electrifying,” says Kanene. “Our voices feel like they were made to sing together.\"\r\n\r\nLong before they combined their voices, the three members of the Lone Bellow were singing on their own. Brian had been writing and recording as a solo artist for more than a decade, with three albums under his own name. Kanene and her husband Jason were living in Beijing, China, hosting open mic nights, playing at local clubs and teaching music lessons. Zach began writing songs in the wake of a family tragedy: After his wife was thrown from a horse, he spent days in the hospital at her bedside, bracing for the worst news. The journal he kept during this period would eventually become his first batch of songs as a solo artist. Happily, his wife made a full recovery.\r\n\r\nWhen Kanene’s brother asked her and Zach to sing “O Happy Day” together at his wedding, they discovered their voices fit together beautifully, but starting a band together seemed impossible when they lived on opposite sides of the world. Brian soon relocated to New York and Kanene moved there to attend culinary school a couple years later. The three got together in their new hometown to work on a few songs of Zach’s, he’d been chipping away at the scene as a solo artist for awhile by then. After hitting those first harmonies did they decide to abandon all other pursuits. Soon the trio was playing all over the city, although they considered Rockwood Music Hall on the Lower East Side to be their home. They opened for the Civil Wars, Dwight Yokam, Brandi Carlile and the Avett Brothers, and their self-titled debut, produced by Nashville’s Charlie Peacock (the Civil Wars, Holly Williams) and released in January 2013, established them as one of the boldest new acts in the Americana movement. \r\n\r\nAfter two hard years of constant touring, the band was exhausted but excited. By 2014, they had written nearly 40 songs on the road and were eager to get them down on tape. After putting together a list of dream producers, they reached out to their first choice, the National guitarist Aaron Dessner, who has helmed albums by the L.A. indie-rock group Local Natives and New York singer-songwriter Sharon Van Etten. \r\n\r\n“It occurred to me that it would be fun to get together and make music with them,” says Aaron. “My main interest in producing records is community and friendship more than making money. I already do a lot of traveling and working with the National, so when I have to time to work with other artists, it should be fun and meaningful.”\r\n\r\n“Aaron is just so kind,” Zach says. “And he has surrounded himself with all these incredibly talented people, like Jonathan Low, the engineer. His brother Bryce [Dessner, also a guitarist for the National] wrote these amazing brass and string arrangements, and he got some of his friends to play with us.”\r\n\r\nDessner and the Lone Bellow spent two weeks recording at Dreamland in upstate New York, a nineteenth-century church that had been converted into a homey studio. The singers found the space to inspire the emotional gravity necessary for the material and the acoustics they were looking for. (For Kanene, Dreamland had one other bonus: “I’m a big Muppets fan, and it looks exactly like the church where Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem lived.”)\r\n\r\nAaron set them up in a circle in what had once been the sanctuary, with microphones hanging in the rafters to capture the sound of their voices bleeding together. Most of the vocals were recorded in single takes, a tactic that adds urgency to songs like “Heaven Don’t Call Me Home” and “If You Don’t Love Me.” “There were a couple of times when somebody sang the wrong word or hit a bad note, and we just had to keep going,” says Zach, who says that recording “Marietta” in particular was daunting—especially the moment near the end when he hits an anguished high note, bends it even higher, and holds it for an impossibly long time. It’s a startling display of vocal range, but it’s also almost unbearably raw in its emotional honesty.\r\n\r\n“‘Marietta’ is probably the darkest song on the whole record,” Zach explains, “and it’s based on something that happened between my wife and me. The band was getting ready to record that song when all of a sudden my wife showed up with our youngest baby. It was a great surprise, a beautiful moment. So I was able to go out and sing that song, knowing she was there to help me carry the moment.”\r\n\r\n“These are true stories,” says Brian. “These aren’t things we made up. We tried to write some songs that had nothing to do with our personal stories, but we just didn’t respond to them. But we’re best buds, so we know each others’ personal stuff and trust each other to figure out what needs to be said and how to say it.” Case in point: Brian wrote “Call to War” about his own struggles during his twenties, but gave the song to Kanene to sing. “The content is painful and brutal,” she says, “but the imagery, the vocals, they build something delicate and ethereal. That kind of contrast illuminates the true beauty and power of a song.”\r\n\r\nSays Brian, “We do this one thing together, and we carry each other. Hopefully that makes the listener want to be a part of it. It becomes a communal thing, which means that there’s never a sad song to sing. It’s more a celebration of the light and the dark.”\r\n\r\n-Descendant Records\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Lone+Bellow\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

He released his second studio album, Glory Sound Prep, on November 9, 2018.\r\n\r\nHe is currently signed to Visionary Music Group and Capitol Records. Bellion also opened the concerts from the third leg of twenty one pilots\' Emotional Roadshow World Tour, which also featured guest artists Judah and the Lion.\r\n\r\nStrictly a producer at age 14, Bellion became increasingly fed up with being asked for generic records. After literally giving singing and rapping \"a shot\" out of frustration, the now 32-year-old Bellion has developed an incredibly unique lane untouched by anyone. His obsession with moving forward and experimentation has driven him to create \"solid and refreshing tunes\", and in the words of Jon himself \"that\'s all that really matters\"\r\n\r\nJon\'s 2010 mixtape \"Scattered Thoughts Vol. 1\", an exploration of different genres all written, composed, produced, and sung by Jon, is available to download from his official site: http://www.jonbellion.com/\r\n\r\nBellion has since released three more mixtapes: Translations Through Speakers, The Separation, and The Definition. \r\n\r\nHis first album \'The Human Condition\' was released on June 10th, 2016; his first piece of music that was sold instead of given for free. His second album \"Glory Sound Prep\" was released on November 9th, 2018.

Bellion co-wrote multiple songs on Justin Bieber\'s Justice album, including the hit song \"Ghost\", which Bellion says he wrote about his late grandmother. The song reached #1 on US Pop Radio. He also co-wrote and co-produced \"Vulnerable\" from Selena Gomez\'s 2020 album Rare and co-wrote \"Daisies\" by Katy Perry.\r\n\r\nOn June 8, 2021, Bellion took to Twitter where he tweeted \"New music\" before quickly deleting the tweet. He then changed his social media into a \"blacked-out\" state a couple of weeks later. Jon was featured on Lawrence\'s song \"False Alarms\" released on July 22, 2021. Bellion released his first single in over 2 years, \"I Feel It\" (with Burna Boy) on September 17, 2021. On February 19, 2023, Bellion released an unfinished song called \"Fallen\" to his social media. The song features Jon Batiste.\r\n\r\nIn July 2019, Bellion launched his own record label called Beautiful Mind Records and signed the pop/soul band, Lawrence. Lawrence was the opener for most of his shows on the Glory Sound Prep Tour. He helped write and produce three singles off of their 2021 debut album Hotel TV: \"Casualty\", \"It\'s Not All About You\", and \"The Weather\".\r\n\r\nBellion has stated that his intention with this new label is to \"take care of artists for the rest of their careers\" and to create a family of musical creators who he supports and with whom he collaborates.\r\n\r\nBellion has stated on multiple occasions that Kanye West is one of his biggest inspirations. \"I loved everything but it was Kanye West who really changed everything for me.\" Bellion has also stated that he was inspired by Eminem, Pharrell Williams, Coldplay, John Mayer, André 3000, and Paul Simon. Bellion has also made it known that he is a big fan of J Dilla and the animated film studio Pixar, drawing inspiration from the musician and computer animation film studio for both The Definition and The Human Condition. Bellion explains that he loves how Pixar movies are \"simple yet presented in a way that is groundbreaking\". Bellion credits much of his musical development and success to his bandmates whom he met while in college, expressing his love for them in his \"Beautiful Mind Documentary\" stating, \"Everybody in my band has taught me something, and has gotten me to where I am because of them\" continuing \"I surround myself with people better than me at something, you will very rarely see somebody around me, especially musically, who I don\'t look up to\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Jon+Bellion\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The project later expanded into a full band, which currently consists of Joseph Mount (vocals, keyboards, guitar), Oscar Cash (keyboards, saxophone, vocals), Gbenga Adelekan (bass, vocals) and Anna Prior (drums, vocals). The band has released five albums: \"Pip Paine (Pay The £5000 You Owe)\" (2006), \"Nights Out\" (2008), \"The English Riviera\" (2011), \"Love Letters\" (2014) and \"Summer 08\" (2016).\r\n\r\nMetronomy began in the tiny, bohemian market town of Totnes, Devon, when Joseph’s Dad sold his son a computer so he could sit in his bedroom and make electronic music. He was inspired by the likes of Autechre, LFO and Aphex Twin, more as a creative hobby than a pop masterplan.\r\n\r\nAfter decamping to Brighton for Uni, Metronomy released their debut album in June 2006. It was called Pip Paine (Pay The £5000 You Owe), and its obtuse but fascinating, largely instrumental electro-pop reflected the eccentricity of its title, and the enduring influence of Totnes.\r\n\r\nJoseph admits that he only, finally, saw the commercial possibilities of Metronomy when DJ, producer, Trash founder and electro-punk avatar Erol Alkan began to feature the single You Could Easily Have Me in his sets, and asked Metronomy to play at his club. Cue the need for a proper live show, and the additions of Gabriel Stebbing, Oscar Cash, dance routines and clothes that blink. \r\n\r\nMove on 2 years and Nights Out a wonky love-child of Giorgio Moroder, New Order, Pet Shop Boys and Unfinished Sympathy is a second album that feels like a debut. The first to be vocal-led, with the self-effacing Joseph stepping up and grabbing the mic for most of the tracks; and, crucially, the first to introduce Metronomy as a fully live propsition, rather than a pseudonym for Joseph‘s solo work. \r\n\r\nAs Metronomy’s busy touring schedule built a buzz amongst kids who instinctively get the dance/art crossover, In April 2009 the Metronomy show took another leap in its evolution, with the addition for the first time of a live drummer in Anna Prior, and bassist Gbenga Adelekan. The new Metronomy was completely live, proving it is possible for electronic bands to put on show as authentic as any rock band. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile Joseph has embarked on a series of prestigious remixes for the likes of Klaxons, Franz Ferdinand, Gorillaz and collaborations with Kate Nash and Florence and The Machine.

The band is led by singer and rhythm guitarist Neil Smith, lead guitarist Christopher Vanderkooy, bassist Peter Wilton, and drummer Mikey Pascuzzi. They describe their own music as \"chewed bubblegum pop\", whereas critics have described their sound as \"sad pop and surf rock\" and has a soft spoken vocal style with guitar driven rock melodies. The band\'s music videos are produced by videographer Lester Lyons-Hookham. The band have sported the same clothes for every live performance since buying them for their first music video shoot.\r\n\r\nThe group formed when high school friends, Neil Smith and Chris Vanderkooy, decided to collaborate on a musical project in 2014. Peter Wilton and Mikey Pascuzzi joined them on bass and drums. In June 2016, the band released its debut EP, Sweet FA, produced and recorded by Smith\'s former roommate Harley Small at The Space Studios in Vancouver BC. They quickly began work on their follow up release and debut LP, Being So Normal. The album was again recorded by Harley Small at The Space Studios  and was released in September 2017 on the Vancouver indie label Kingfisher Bluez.\r\n\r\nVocalist/rhythm guitarist Neil Smith was formerly part of the folk band Dogwood and Dahlia. Smith and bassist Peter Wilton formerly worked as Amazon delivery drivers, guitarist Christopher Vanderkooy worked at a local Vancouver brewery, and drummer Mikey Pascuzzi worked as a carpenter. The band quit their jobs to go on their first tour of North America, Europe and Asia from 2017-2018. They have been touring steadily ever since the release of their debut album.\r\n\r\nPeach Pit performed at Bonnaroo, Shaky Knees Music Festival, CBC Music Festival, and Capital Hill Block Party in 2019 and opened for Two Door Cinema Club in a tour of the U.S. and Canada in 2019. The band has mentioned in interviews and during shows that they have recorded a new album.\r\n\r\n2) Peach Pit is a 4-piece math/post rock band from Croatia formed in 1994.\r\n\r\nThe idea of making a band was started by Bruno Vidović and Mihael Bele in 1994, and after few parties, name Peach Pit (after an odd restaurant in the 90210) emerged as a name for a band that would create noise rock on the heritage of Big Black, Killdozer, Scratch acid and others. Peach Pit\'s first lineup was formed in the autumn of 1994 and it consisted of Mihael Bele on guitar, Bruno Vidović on drums and Branko Beðtak on bass.\r\n\r\nFirst concerts which promoted early materials that featured vocals were loud and genuinely violent and often featured stage acts such as firecrackers, feedback and stage diving, for which they were often discarded as juvenile and abrupted by sound engineers by pulling out of electricity or even police.\r\n\r\nBy 1996, Peach Pit turned completely instrumental under influence of new music from across the water, and also played a lot of shows, some of them with noted names such as Zeni Geva. In the spring of 1997, Franjo Gluðac (previously from Liquid Light, also instrumental) joined Peach Pit on the second guitar, and his coming also marked departure of Beðtak which left Peach Pit as a three-piece with Franjo and Mihael on guitars and basses and Bruno on drums. Along with that, first compilation appearances were made, and Peach Pit was now open to audiences outside of Zagreb and started making materials for the first release.\r\n\r\nTricky Slaughter Operation cd-r (burned in 100 copies) was issued in the spring of 1998 and featured Tomica Ðãavina of Brassneck on bass (who left after the album was recorded and a short tour) and also Beðtak\'s guest appearance on one song. It was recorded live during a six month period in Kozmo. During that period Mihael and Franjo were also the guitar part of the Lunar with which Peach Pit shared a practice room.\r\n\r\nNext self-release was Autom csep, which was mostly recorded by overdubbing in Kozmo in summer of 1998 and was issued along with Christmas greeting card ep which was recorded later that year. It was followed by a short concert break which was used for making of a first official album, Suspicios Cargo which was recorded in june of 1999 and was issued nine months later on Ivica Barièeviã\'s Earwing records. Bara also became promotor for most of the Peach Pit\'s concerts during that period.\r\n\r\nFinishing of Suspicious cargo also marked Bruno Motik being recruited on second guitar, which created current lineup that exists since 1999. His coming brought complexity to songwriting and a step toward exploring new techniques which became our trademark since then.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 2000, material for a second album (Music for the Fruitcake Generation) was recorded but was lost. That period was marked with heavy concerting which, along with a album material failure brought some problems to the band after which Peach Pit decided to take a one year break in 2001 after which a short European tour in 2003, that featured five-piece with Branko Beðtak(again) on bass, and Bruno Motik on second drums and guitar, took place. Also, Peach Pit also named a genre for the music which they are playing, sport-rock.\r\n\r\nLater, in 2004 some of the songs from the lost material were re-recorded in Kozmo using live recording technique directly to tape and are to be released on Interstellar records Supernova 2 compilation. Four new Sport Rock songs have been recorded (26mins) in january 2006 in Kozmo, and are awaiting mix. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Peach+Pit\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Her creative pursuits began early in her childhood. Her parents -mom is a visual artist, dad plays the drums -nurtured and encouraged their daughter’s creativity, and the music they played around the house, including the Eagles and John Mayer, became the building blocks of her sound. At the same time, like most young people, she gravitated towards the music of her teen years including Kid Cudi, Alicia Keys, Beyoncé and SZA and their ability to use music to speak truth to their feelings. These influences, her natural singing ability and the fact that she is a self-proclaimed “daydreamer” who “falls in love too fast” and is drawn to sad songs, brought her to be the artist you hear today -blending pop and soul with lyrics that allow Maeta to be a voice for those who struggle to express their emotions. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Maeta\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Fascinated with drugs, anger, and the evils of male privilege, Viagra Boys became a cult phenomenon in their homeland before word spread throughout Europe, the United Kingdom, and North America about their punishing and articulate approach. After making their recording debut and setting their creative template with the 2016 EP Consistency of Energy, Viagra Boys both refined and sharpened their signature sound on their first full-length album, 2018\'s Street Worms. The album\'s strong critical reception helped bolster enthusiasm for their follow-up, Welfare Jazz, which appeared in early 2021.\r\n\r\nViagra Boys formed in 2015 in Stockholm, Sweden. Tattoo artists Henrik Höckert and Sebastian Murphy (the latter born in San Francisco but living in Stockholm) met through a mutual acquaintance and went out for a night of drinking. The two ended up at a karaoke bar, and after hearing Murphy belt out a unique version of Mariah Carey\'s \"We Belong Together,\" Höckert decided they needed to form a band. With Murphy on lead vocals and Höckert on bass, they recruited guitarist Benjamin Vallé, who had previously worked with Höckert in the group Nitad. With the addition of drummer Sol Tor Sjödén, the core of the group was complete and they began writing songs.\r\n\r\nBy the time Viagra Boys started playing out in June 2015, they\'d added Oskar Karls on sax and producer Martin Ehrencrona on keyboards. By 2016, they decided it was time to document their music, and they cut a four-song EP, Consistency of Energy, issued by Kosmos Recordings. The Push My Buttons label brought out their second record, the 2017 EP Call of the Wild, but for their first full-length album, 2018\'s Street Worms, they signed with Year0001 Records, putting them on the same label as Swedish rapper Yung Lean. If the band was uncomfortable with the association, they didn\'t show it, and Street Worms got enthusiastic reviews while the tracks \"Sports\" and \"Just Like You\" earned enough streaming plays and video views to raise their following beyond the underground. Viagra Boys\' unpredictable live show was documented on a 2019 concert recording, Shrimp Sessions, that was released only in Japan. In April 2020, Viagra Boys were back with their first studio recordings since Street Worms, a forceful four-song EP titled Common Sense.

Her songs actually spoke to me, where a lot of Christian music is the same message with different words,” explains Dane. “[JJ and Dave] live their art, and I never felt like they were trying too hard to be something they weren\'t.”\r\n\r\nIn addition to JJ and Dave’s prominent talents, Only Love Remains features Bryan Sutton (Dixie Chicks, The Chieftains) on mandolin, guitar and banjo; David Henry (Over the Rhine) on cello; Ben Shive (Andrew Peterson) on piano; Andy Hubbard (Little Big Town, Fernando Ortega) on drums, Aaron Sands (Jars of Clay) on bass; with Jeremy Casella (singer/songwriter) and Andrew Osenga (Caedmon’s Call) on guitars/backing vocals.\r\n\r\nOnly Love Remains follows Heller’s 2005 EP, Collection of Thoughts, and her debut release, Songs That I Know (2004.)\r\n\r\nJJ began her career nearly six years ago at San Jose Christian College where she dabbled in songwriting and performed at local coffeehouses. After graduating, JJ and Dave got married and relocated to Phoenix to pursue music full time. In August of 2006, they moved to Nashville, TN where they currently reside. The combination of Dave’s business sense and creative input, and JJ’s loose artistic style drives their success.\r\n\r\n“We’re definitely two halves of a whole,” she explains. “I write the bulk of the lyrics and Dave is the editor and arranger, making the songs more effective. He also does everything on the business side, which is great because it frees me up to be creative.”\r\n\r\nFor Only Love Remains, the pair focused on a braver songwriting style, departing slightly from JJ’s prior introspective lyrics and exploring story-songs about the lives around them. Musically, they pulled influence from artists like Damien Rice and Over the Rhine, with a lyrical intricacy akin to Patty Griffin. The result is an exceptional collection of songs that is warm and engaging with a little bit of edge.\r\n\r\nIn writing material for the new release, JJ poured her every day observations into her songbook: stories she heard while traveling, and those nearer to her heart. “This album is all about redemption,” observes JJ. “ Looking back on the songs, there’s a lot of struggle written into them because that’s life. Everyone has different problems to face, but in the end, the outcome hinges on how you deal with those struggles-- if you allow them to destroy you or make you stronger.”\r\n\r\nPerhaps it’s her insight and sensitivity that consistently draw a female audience to JJ’s music. She touches on issues of self-image and worry, questions of faith, and feelings of loneliness; her songs resonate with women and offer encouragement. But JJ’s music connects with people from all walks of life. Whether performing in a quaint coffeehouse, at a weekend retreat, or a Sunday morning church service for 1000 people, the Hellers aim to be themselves wherever they go. They maintain a balance of light-hearted humor and poignant dialogue with their listeners.\r\n\r\nAs an artist, JJ Heller is a mix of eclectic and down-to-earth: from her jeans and t-shirt style to the way she pushes her own boundaries. When it comes to her music, she never settles.\r\n\r\n\"Music has a way of speaking to my heart like nothing else can,\" JJ says. \"It is my hope and prayer that my songs will somehow speak to my listeners and bring them hope, peace and inspiration.\"\r\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/JJ+Heller\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Every song on his thrilling upcoming debut solo album, Depreciated, is lush with intricate wordplay and haunting imagery, as well as being backed by a band that is on fire.  One of his biggest long-time fans is roots music favorite Tyler Childers, who says he\'s \"a well-travelled wordsmith mapping out the world he\'s seen, three chords at a time.\" Miller is somehow able to transport us to a shadowy honkytonk and get existential all in the same line with his tightly written compositions. Miller\'s own guitar-playing is on fine display here along with vocals that evoke the white-waters of the Potomac River rumbling below the high ridges of his native Shenandoah Valley. \r\n\r\nMiller grew up in the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia near the Potomac River. \"There are three or four little towns I know well that make up the region,\" he says, name-checking places like Martinsburg, Shepherdstown, Hedgesville, and Keyes Gap. \"It\'s a haunted place.  In some ways it\'s frozen in time. So much old stuff has lingered there, and its history is still very present.\" As much as Miller loves where he\'s from, he\'s always had a complicated relationship with home and never could figure out what to do with himself there. \"I just wanted to make music, and there\'s no real infrastructure for that there.  We had to travel to play regularly and as teenagers, most of our gigs were spent playing in old church halls or Ruritan Clubs.\"  He was raised \"kinda sorta Catholic\" and although he gave up on that as a teenager, he says \"it follows me everywhere, still.\"\r\n\r\nHis family was not musical—his father worked odd jobs and was a paramedic before Miller was born, while his mother was a nurse—but he was drawn to music at an early age, which was essential to him since he says school was \"an exercise in patience\" for him. \"Music was the first thing to turn my brain on. I\'d sit by the stereo for hours with a blank audio cassette waiting to record songs I liked,\" he says. \"I was into a lot of whatever was on the radio until I was in middle school and started finding out about punk music, which is what I gravitated toward and tried to play through high school.\" Not long after a short and aimless attempt at college, I was introduced to old time and traditional fiddle music, particularly around West Virginia, and my whole musical world started to open up.\" Around the same time he discovered John Prine and says the music of Steve Earle sent him \"down a rabbit hole\". From there he found the 1970s Texas gods like Guy Clark, Townes Van Zandt, Jerry Jeff Walker, Billy Joe Shaver, and Blaze Foley, the swamp pop of Bobby Charles, and the Tulsa Sound of J.J. Cale, who is probably his biggest influence.\r\n\r\nAs much as the music buoyed him, it also took its toll. \"I always prioritized being a touring musician above everything, and my attempts at relationships suffered for it,\" he says. Miller was also often fighting depression and watching many of his friends \"go off the rails on occasion.\" He says that for a long period he did a lot of self-medicating. \"I used to go about it by drinking vodka from morning to night for months on end,\" he says. \"I shouldn\'t have made it this far. I\'m lucky, I think.\" Ultimately, the music won out and Depreciated is the hard-won result of years of self-education provided by life experiences that included arrests, a drunken knife-throwing incident, relationships both lost and long-term, and learning from the best of the singer-songwriters by listening. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/John+R.+Miller\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Via the music sharing platform SoundCloud, the duo rose to popularity for their abrasive, self-produced beats, as well as their harsh lyrical content and themes prominently featuring substance use disorder and suicidal ideation. The duo are considered one of the most popular artists in the underground rap scene. They own and operate their own label, G*59 Records, under which all of their music is signed. \r\n\r\nThe music of $uicideBoy$ varies between different sub-genres of rap; while some songs have melancholy tones with lyrical content that focuses on subjects such as depression and suicidal ideation (topics not widely exposed in rap music), others are wildly aggressive, with themes of violence and sexual content. Some of their music is based around life growing up in New Orleans; song titles such as Audubon, Tulane, Elysian Fields and St. Bernard reflect streets and neighborhoods that influenced the life of Arceneaux and Petrou. A large portion of their music focuses on depression and its symptoms, an angle not often received in mainstream hip hop; Arceneaux elaborated on this in an interview with Mass Appeal, stating, “A lot of people take it as emo, or depressed music, or negative music... it’s really just connecting. It’s therapy, through music\". Excluding occasional guest producers, the entirety of Suicideboys\' discography is self-produced, mainly by Arceneaux under his pseudonym Budd Dwyer (an homage to the former politician of the same name).\r\n\r\n$crim was born Scott Arceneaux Jr. on April 11, 1989 in Marrero, Louisiana. Arceneaux originally was inspired by T-Pain and Kanye West to produce music, buying his first laptop which he used to start DJing with money gained from selling drugs. Arceneaux\'s passion for DJing extended when he started to attend Delgado Community College, where he was hired to DJ parties. He also worked selling used furniture, getting fired for his new hand tattoos after three years.\r\n\r\nRuby da Cherry was born Aristos Petrou (Αρίστος Πέτρου) on April 22, 1990 to an American mother and Greek Cypriot father. Raised in Metairie, Louisiana, Petrou\'s interest in music began when he was seven, playing violin and then drums when he was ten, eventually joining bands in middle school. He worked at his father\'s restaurant as a waiter, a job he held until 2015. His experience with the punk rock scene continued as he joined the band Vapo-Rats as its drummer; however, disillusioned with the apathy his bandmates showed towards the future of the band, Petrou left in order to pursue a career in hip-hop with Arceneaux.\r\n\r\nArceneaux and Petrou are cousins, and as such shared a close relationship growing up. Realising that both were interested in taking a musical career seriously, and both dissatisfied with the direction of their lives, the two formed Suicideboys, making a pact that if their musical career didn’t work out, they would both commit suicide. Elaborating on this in an interview with Mass Appeal, Arceneaux states that, “it was pretty much like cutting the hand, bleeding, and making a pact that there’s no plan B, that if this doesn’t happen by the time we’re 30, I’m blowing my head off”.\r\n\r\nThe duo\'s first project together, a three-track EP named Kill Yourself Part I: The $uicide $aga, was released in June 2014 on SoundCloud and Bandcamp, attracting attention for their collaboration with notable underground rapper Bones. In the following months, the duo released a further nine iterations of the Kill Yourself series. After a number of collaboration EPs with fellow underground artist Black Smurf, their first full length project titled Gray/Grey was released on March 3, 2015.\r\n\r\nSuicideboys\' underground breakthrough came with the release of 2015 EP $outh $ide $uicide, a collaboration with established South Florida rapper Pouya, which thrust the duo into the underground rap spotlight. Other 2015 releases include 7th or St. Tammany, YUNGDEATHLILLIFE, High Tide in the Snake\'s Nest, Grey Sheep EP, I No Longer Fear The Razor Guarding My Heel (part I and II), My Liver Will Handle What My Heart Can\'t, Now The Moon\'s Rising and G.R.E.Y.G.O.D.S. with fellow g59 rapper RAMIREZ.\r\n\r\n The duo\'s first foray onto the mainstream musical charts came with the release of Radical $uicide in the summer of 2016. The five-track EP, produced by EDM musician Getter, peaked at number 17 on the Billboard Rap charts. Other 2016 releases include Dark Side of the Clouds, Grey Sheep II, Eternal Grey, I No Longer Fear The Razor Guarding My Heel (part III), G.R.E.Y.G.O.D.S.I.I. with [artis]RAMIREZ, DIRTYNASTY$UICIDE with GERM, and Black $uicide Side C with Black Smurf.\r\n\r\nIn 2017 the boys released another 10 iterations of the Kill Yourself series, they also dropped DIRTIERNASTIER$UICIDE, with GERM.\r\n\r\nOn September 7, 2018, their debut studio album I Want to Die in New Orleans was released.

He is credited with popularizing hip hop in Middle America and is regarded as one of the greatest rappers of all time. Eminem\'s global success and acclaimed works are widely regarded as having broken racial barriers for the acceptance of white rappers in popular music. While much of his transgressive work during the late 1990s and early 2000s made him a controversial figure, he came to be a representation of popular angst of the American underclass and has been cited as an influence by and upon many artists working in various genres.\r\n\r\nAfter the release of his debut album Infinite (1996) and the extended play Slim Shady EP (1997), Eminem signed with Dr. Dres Aftermath Entertainment and subsequently achieved mainstream popularity in 1999 with The Slim Shady LP. His next two releases, The Marshall Mathers LP (2000) and The Eminem Show (2002), were worldwide successes and were nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. After the release of his next album, Encore (2004), Eminem went on hiatus in 2005, largely due to a prescription drug addiction. He returned to the music industry four years later with the release of Relapse (2009) and Recovery, which was released the following year. Recovery was the bestselling album worldwide in 2010, making it Eminem\'s second album, after The Eminem Show in 2002, to be the best-selling album of the year worldwide. In the following years, he released the US number-one albums The Marshall Mathers LP 2 (2013), Revival (2017), Kamikaze (2018), Music to Be Murdered By (2020), and  The Death of Slim Shady (Coup De Grâce) (2024).\r\n\r\nEminem\'s hit songs include \"My Name Is\", \"The Real Slim Shady\", \"The Way I Am\", \"Stan\", \"Without Me\", \"Lose Yourself\", \"Mockingbird\", \"Not Afraid\", \"Love the Way You Lie\", \"Rap God\", \"The Monster\", and \"Godzilla\". In addition to his solo career, Eminem was a member of the hip-hop group D12. He is also known for collaborations with fellow Detroit-based rapper Royce da 5\'9\"; the two are collectively known as Bad Meets Evil.\r\n\r\nEminem starred in the 2002 musical drama film 8 Mile, playing a dramatized version of himself. \"Lose Yourself\", a track from its soundtrack, topped the Billboard Hot 100 for 12 weeks, the most for a solo rap song, and won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, making Eminem the first hip-hop artist ever to win the award. He has made cameo appearances in the films The Wash (2001), Funny People (2009), and The Interview (2014), and the television series Entourage (2010). Eminem has developed other ventures, including Shady Records, a joint venture with the manager Paul Rosenberg, which helped launch the careers of artists such as 50 Cent, D12, Obie Trice, Westside boogie, Grip, and Ez Mil among others. He has also established his channel, Shade 45, on Sirius XM Radio.\r\n\r\nEminem is among the best-selling music artists of all time, with estimated worldwide sales of over 220 million records. He was the best-selling music artist in the United States of the 2000s and the bestselling male music artist in the United States of the 2010s, third overall. Billboard named him the \"Artist of the Decade (2000–2009)\". He has had ten number-one albums on the Billboard 200—which all consecutively debuted at number one on the chart, making him the first artist to achieve this—and five number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100. The Marshall Mathers LP, The Eminem Show, Curtain Call: The Hits (2005), \"Lose Yourself\", \"Love the Way You Lie\", and \"Not Afraid\" have all been certified Diamond or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Rolling Stone has included him in its lists of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time and the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time. He has won numerous awards, including 15 Grammy Awards, eight American Music Awards, 17 Billboard Music Awards, an Academy Award, a Primetime Emmy Award, and an MTV Europe Music Global Icon Award. In November 2022, Eminem was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\r\n\r\nEarly life:\r\nMarshall Bruce Mathers III was born on October 17, 1972, in St. Joseph, Missouri, the only child of Marshall Bruce Mathers Jr. and Deborah Rae \"Debbie\" (née Nelson). He is of Scottish, Welsh, English, Cherokee, German, Swiss, Polish, and possibly Luxembourgish ancestry. His mother nearly died during her 73-hour labor with him. Eminem\'s parents were in a band called Daddy Warbucks, playing in Ramada Inns along the Dakotas–Montana border before they separated. His father abandoned his family when Eminem was a year and a half old, and he was raised only by his mother, Debbie, in poverty. His mother later had a son named Nathan \"Nate\" Kane Samara. At age twelve, he and his mother had moved several times and lived in several towns and cities in Missouri (including St. Joseph, Savannah, and Kansas City) before settling in Warren, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit. Eminem frequently fought with his mother, whom a social worker described as having a \"very suspicious, almost paranoid personality\". He wrote letters to his father, but Debbie said that they all came back marked \"return to sender\". When he was a child, a bully named D\'Angelo Bailey severely injured Eminem\'s head in an assault, an incident which Eminem later recounted (with comic exaggeration) in the song \"Brain Damage\". Debbie filed a lawsuit against the public school for this in 1982. The suit was dismissed the following year by a Macomb County, Michigan judge, who said the schools were immune from lawsuits. For much of his youth, Eminem and his mother lived in a working-class, primarily black, Detroit neighborhood. He and Debbie were one of three white households on their block, and Eminem was beaten several times by black youths.\r\n\r\nEminem was interested in storytelling, aspiring to be a comic book artist before discovering hip-hop. He heard his first rap song (\"Reckless\", featuring Ice-T) on the Breakin\' soundtrack, a gift from Debbie\'s half-brother Ronnie Polkingharn. His uncle was close to the boy and later became a musical mentor to him. When Polkingharn committed suicide in 1991, Eminem stopped speaking publicly for days and did not attend his funeral.\r\n\r\nAt age 14, Eminem began rapping with high-school friend Mike Ruby; they adopted the names \"Manix\" and \"M&M\", the latter evolving into \"Eminem\". Eminem sneaked into neighboring Osborn High School with a friend and fellow rapper Proof for lunchroom freestyle rap battles. On Saturdays, they attended open mic contests at the Hip-Hop Shop on West 7 Mile Road, considered \"ground zero\" for the Detroit rap scene. Struggling to succeed in a predominantly black industry, Eminem was appreciated by underground hip-hop audiences. When he wrote verses, he wanted most of the words to rhyme; he wrote long words or phrases on paper and, underneath, worked on rhymes for each syllable. Although the words often made little sense, the drill helped Eminem practice sounds and rhymes.\r\n\r\nIn 1987, Debbie allowed runaway Kimberly Anne \"Kim\" Scott to stay at their home. Several years later, Eminem began an on-and-off relationship with Scott. After spending three years in ninth grade due to truancy and poor grades, he dropped out of Lincoln High School at age 17. Although interested in English, Eminem never explored literature (preferring comic books) and he disliked math and social studies. Eminem worked at several jobs to help his mother pay the bills. One of the jobs he had was with Little Caesar\'s Pizza in Warren, Michigan. He later said she often threw him out of the house anyway, often after taking most of his paycheck. When she left to play bingo, he would blast the stereo and write songs.\r\n\r\nCareer:\r\n1988–1997: Early career, Infinite, and family struggles\r\nIn 1988, he went by the stage name MC Double M and formed his first group New Jacks, and made a self-titled demo tape with DJ Butter Fingers. In 1989, they later joined Bassmint Productions who later changed their name to Soul Intent in 1992 with rapper Proof and other childhood friends. They released a self-titled EP in 1995 featuring Proof. Eminem also made his first music video appearance in 1992 in a song titled, \"Do-Da-Dippity\", by Champtown. Later in 1996, Eminem and Proof teamed up with four other rappers to form The Dirty Dozen (D12), who released The Underground E.P. in 1997 and their first album Devil\'s Night in 2001. He was also affiliated with Newark\'s rap collective Outsidaz, collaborating with them on different projects.\r\n\r\nEminem was soon signed to Jeff and Mark Bass\'s F.B.T. Productions and recorded his debut album Infinite for their independent Web Entertainment label. The album was a commercial failure upon its release in 1996. One lyrical subject ofInfinite was his struggle to raise his newborn daughter, Hailie Jade Scott Mathers, on little money. During this period, Eminem\'s rhyming style, primarily inspired by rappers Nas, Esham, and AZ, lacked the comically violent slant for which he later became known. Detroit disc jockeys largely ignoredInfinite and the feedbackEminem did receive (\"Why don\'t you go into rock and roll?\") led him to craft angrier, moodier tracks.\r\n\r\nAt this time Eminem and Kim Scott lived in a crime-ridden neighborhood and their house was robbed several times. Eminem cooked and washed dishes for minimum wage at Gilbert\'s Lodge, a family-style restaurant at St. Clair Shores. His former boss described him as becoming a model employee, as he worked 60 hours a week for six months after Hailie\'s birth. He was fired shortly before Christmas and later said, \"It was, like, five days before Christmas, which is Hailie\'s birthday. I had, like, forty dollars to get her something.\" After the release of Infinite, his personal problems and substance abuse culminated in a suicide attempt. By March 1997 he was fired from Gilbert\'s Lodge for the last time and lived in his mother\'s mobile home with Kim and Hailie.\r\n\r\n1997–1999: Introduction of Slim Shady, The Slim Shady LP and rise to success\r\nEminem attracted more attention when he developed Slim Shady, a sadistic, violent alter ego. The character allowed him to express his anger with lyrics about drugs, rape and murder. In the spring of 1997 he recorded his debut EP,  The Slim Shady EP, which was released that winter by Web Entertainment. The EP, with frequent references to drug use, sexual acts, mental instability, and violence, also explored the more serious themes of dealing with poverty and marital and family difficulties and revealed his direct, self-deprecating response to criticism. Hip-hop magazine The Source featured Eminem in its \"Unsigned Hype\" column in March 1998.\r\n\r\nAfter he was fired from his job and evicted from his home, Eminem went to Los Angeles to compete in the 1997 Rap Olympics, an annual, nationwide battle rap competition. He placed second and an Interscope Records intern named Dean Geistlinger was in attendance and asked Eminem for a copy of  The Slim Shady EP, which was then sent to the company CEO Jimmy Iovine. Iovine played the tape for record producer Dr. Dre, founder of Aftermath Entertainment and founding member of hip hop group N.W.A. Dre recalled, \"In my entire career in the music industry, I have never found anything from a demo tape or a CD. When Jimmy played this, I said, \'Find him. Now.\'\" He would later state on the fourth and last episode of The Defiant Ones, \"I was like: what the fuck!?, and who the fuck is that?\" expressing his shock towards Mathers\' rapping talent. Although his associates criticized him for hiring a white rapper, he was confident in his decision: \"I don\'t give a fuck if you\'re purple; if you can kick it, I\'m working with you. Eminem had idolized Dre since listening to N.W.A as a teenager and was nervous about working with him on an album: \"I didn\'t want to be starstruck or kiss his ass too much ... I\'m just a little white boy from Detroit. I had never seen stars let alone Dr. Dre. He became more comfortable working with Dre after a series of productive recording sessions.\r\n\r\nEminem released The Slim Shady LP in February 1999. Although it was one of the year\'s most popular albums (certified triple platinum by the end of the year), he was accused of imitating the style and subject matter of underground rapper Cage. The album\'s popularity was accompanied by controversy over its lyrics; in \"\'97 Bonnie & Clyde\" Eminem describes a trip with his infant daughter when he disposes of his wife\'s body and in \"Guilty Conscience\" which encourages a man to murder his wife and her lover. \"Guilty Conscience\" marked the beginning of a friendship and musical bond between Dr. Dre and Eminem. The label-mates later collaborated on many hit songs (\"Forgot About Dre\" and \"What\'s the Difference\" while also providing uncredited vocals on \"The Watcher\" from Dr. Dre\'s album 2001, \"Bitch Please II\" from The Marshall Mathers LP, \"Say What You Say\" from The Eminem Show, \"Encore/Curtains Down\" from Encore and \"Old Time\'s Sake\" and \"Crack a Bottle\" from Relapse) and Dre made at least one guest appearance on each of Eminem\'s Aftermath albums. The Slim Shady LP has been certified quadruple platinum by the RIAA.\r\n\r\n1999–2003: The Marshall Mathers LP and The Eminem Show\r\nAfter Eminem released The Slim Shady LP, he started his own record label, Shady Records, in late 1999. Eminem looked for an avenue to release D12, and his manager Paul Rosenberg was keen to start a label, which led to the two teaming up to form Shady. Its A&R Marc Labelle has defined the record label as \"a boutique label but [with] all the outlets of a major [and] Interscope backing up our every move.\r\n\r\nRecorded from 1999 to 2000, The Marshall Mathers LP was released in May 2000. It sold 1.76 million copies in its first week, breaking US records held by Snoop Dogg\'s Doggystyle for the fastest-selling hip-hop album and Britney Spears\' ...Baby One More Time for the fastest-selling solo album. The first single from the album, \"The Real Slim Shady\", was a success despite controversies about Eminem\'s insults and dubious claims about celebrities (for example, that Christina Aguilera had performed oral sex on Carson Daly and Fred Durst). In his second single, \"The Way I Am\", he reveals the pressure from his record company to top \"My Name Is\". Although Eminem parodied shock rocker Marilyn Manson in the music video for \"My Name Is\", they are reportedly on good terms; Manson is mentioned in \"The Way I Am\", appeared in its music video and has performed a live remix of the song with Eminem. In the third single, \"Stan\" (which samples Dido\'s \"Thank You\"), Eminem tries to deal with his new fame, assuming the persona of a deranged fan who kills himself and his pregnant girlfriend (mirroring \"\'97 Bonnie & Clyde\" from The Slim Shady LP).\r\n\r\nThe music magazine Q called \"Stan\" the third-greatest rap song ever, and it was ranked tenth in a Top40-Charts.com survey. The song has since been ranked 296th on Rolling Stone\'s \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\" list. In July 2000, Eminem was the first white artist to appear on the cover of The Source. The Marshall Mathers LP was certified Diamond by the RIAA in March 2011 and sold 21 million copies worldwide.\r\n\r\nIn 2000 Eminem also appeared on the Up in Smoke Tour with rappers Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Xzibit and Ice Cube and the Family Values Tour with Limp Bizkit, headlining the The Anger Management Tour with Papa Roach, Ludacris and Xzibit. Eminem performed with Elton John at the 43rd Grammy Awards ceremony in 2001, with the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD, an organization that considered Eminem\'s lyrics homophobic) condemning John\'s decision to perform with Eminem. Entertainment Weekly placed the appearance on its end-of-decade \"best-of\" list: \"It was the hug heard \'round the world. Eminem, under fire for homophobic lyrics, shared the stage with a gay icon for a performance of \'Stan\' that would have been memorable in any context. On February 21, the day of the awards ceremony, GLAAD held a protest outside the Staples Center (the ceremony\'s venue). Eminem was also the only guest artist to appear on fellow rapper Jay-Z\'s critically acclaimed album The Blueprint, producing and rapping on the song \"Renegade\".\r\n\r\nThe Eminem Show was released in May 2002. It was another success, reaching number one on the charts and selling over 1.332 million copies during its first full week. The album\'s single, \"Without Me\", denigrates boy bands, Limp Bizkit, Dick and Lynne Cheney, Moby, and others. The Eminem Show, certified Diamond by the RIAA, examines the effects of Eminem\'s rise to fame, his relationship with his wife and daughter and his status in the hip-hop community, addressing an assault charge brought by a bouncer he saw kissing his wife in 2000. Although several tracks are clearly angry, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic found The Eminem Show less inflammatory than The Marshall Mathers LP. L. Brent Bozell III, who had criticized The Marshall Mathers LP for misogynistic lyrics, noted The Eminem Show\'s extensive use of obscenity and called Eminem \"Eminef\" for the prevalence of the word \"motherfucker\" on the album. The Eminem Show sold 27 million copies worldwide and was the bestselling album of 2002.\r\n\r\n2003–2007: Production work, Encore and musical hiatus\r\nIn 2003, Eminem, a lifelong fan of Tupac, provided production work for three tracks on the Tupac Resurrection soundtrack. He would follow this up the next year by producing 12 of the 16 tracks on Tupac\'s Loyal to the Game album. On December 8, 2003, the United States Secret Service said that it was \"looking into\" allegations that Eminem had threatened the President of the United States. The cause for concern was the lyrics of \"We As Americans\" (\"Fuck money / I don\'t rap for dead presidents / I\'d rather see the president dead / It\'s never been said, but I set precedents\"), which was later released on a bonus CD with the deluxe edition of Encore.\r\n\r\nEncore, released in 2004, was another success, but not as successful as his previous albums. Its sales were partially driven by the first single, \"Just Lose It\", which contained slurs directed toward Michael Jackson. On October 12, 2004, a week after the release of \"Just Lose It\", Jackson phoned Steve Harvey\'s radio show, The Steve Harvey Morning Show, to report his displeasure with its video (which parodies Jackson\'s child molestation trial, plastic surgery and the 1984 incident when Jackson\'s hair caught fire during the filming of a commercial). In the song, Eminem says, \"That\'s not a stab at Michael / That\'s just a metaphor / I\'m just psycho.\" Many of Jackson\'s friends and supporters spoke out against the video, including Stevie Wonder, who described it as \"kicking a man while he\'s down\" and \"bullshit\", and Steve Harvey (who said, \"Eminem has lost his ghetto pass. We want the pass back\"). The video also parodied Pee-wee Herman, MC Hammer, and Madonna during her Blond Ambition period. \"Weird Al\" Yankovic, who parodied the Eminem song \"Lose Yourself\" on \"Couch Potato\" for his 2003 album Poodle Hat, told the Chicago Sun-Times about Jackson\'s protest: \"Last year, Eminem forced me to halt production on the video for my \'Lose Yourself\' parody because he somehow thought that it would be harmful to his image or career. So the irony of this situation with Michael is not lost on me. Although Black Entertainment Television stopped playing the video, MTV announced that it would continue to air it. The Source, through CEO Raymond \"Benzino\" Scott, called for the video to be pulled, the song removed from the album, and Eminem to apologize publicly to Jackson. In 2007, Jackson and Sony bought Famous Music from Viacom, giving him the rights to songs by Eminem, Shakira, Beck, and others.\r\n\r\nDespite its lead single\'s humorous theme, Encore explored serious subject matter with the anti-war song \"Mosh\", which criticized President George W. Bush as \"This weapon of mass destruction that we call our president\", with lyrics including \"Fuck Bush. On October 25, 2004, a week before the 2004 U.S. Presidential election, Eminem released the video for \"Mosh\" on the Internet. In it, Eminem gathers an army (including rapper Lloyd Banks) of Bush-administration victims and leads them to the White House. When they break in, it is learned that they are there to register to vote; the video ends with \"VOTE Tuesday, November 2.\" After Bush\'s reelection, the video\'s ending was changed to Eminem and the protesters invading the White House during a speech by the president. Also in 2004, Eminem launched a satellite music channel, Shade 45, on Sirius radio, which was described by his manager as \"essentially a destination to get and hear things that other people aren\'t playing.\r\n\r\nEminem began his first US concert tour in three years in the summer of 2005 with the Anger Management 3 Tour, featuring 50 Cent, G-Unit, Lil Jon, D12, Obie Trice and the Alchemist, but in August he canceled the European leg of the tour, later announcing that he had entered drug rehabilitation for treatment of a \"dependency on sleep medication\". Meanwhile, industry insiders speculated that Eminem was considering retirement, while rumors circulated that a double album titled The Funeral would be released. In July, the Detroit Free Press reported a possible final bow for Eminem as a solo performer, quoting members of his inner circle as saying that he would embrace the roles of producer and label executive. A greatest hits album, Curtain Call: The Hits, was released on December 6, 2005, by Aftermath Entertainment, and sold nearly 441,000 copies in the US in its first week, marking Eminem\'s fourth consecutive number-one album on the Billboard Hot 200, and was certified double platinum by the RIAA. However, Eminem suggested that month on WKQI\'s \"Mojo in the Morning\" show that he would be taking a break as an artist: \"I\'m at a point in my life right now where I feel like I don\'t know where my career is going ... This is the reason that we called it \'Curtain Call\' because this could be the final thing. We don\'t know.\r\n\r\nIn April 2006, Proof, who was Eminem\'s childhood friend, was murdered. Eight months later, Eminem released a compilation album titled Eminem Presents: The Re-Up that featured Proof and other Shady Records artists.\r\n\r\n2007–2009: Comeback and Relapse\r\nIn September 2007, Eminem called New York radio station WQHT during an interview with 50 Cent, saying that he was \"in limbo\" and \"debating\" about when (or if) he would release another album: \"I\'m always working – I\'m always in the studio. It feels good right now, the energy of the label. For a while, I didn\'t want to go back to the studio ... I went through some personal things. I\'m coming out of those personal things [and] it feels good.\r\n\r\nEminem appeared on his Shade 45 Sirius channel in September 2008, saying: \"Right now I\'m kinda just concentrating on my own stuff, for right now and just banging out tracks and producing a lot of stuff. You know, the more I keep producing the better it seems like I get \'cause I just start knowing stuff. Interscope confirmed that a new album would be released in spring 2009. In December 2008, Eminem provided more details about the album, entitled Relapse: \"Me and Dre are back in the lab like the old days, man. Dre will end up producing the majority of the tracks on \'Relapse\'. We are up to our old mischievous ways ... let\'s just leave it at that.\r\n\r\nAccording to a March 5, 2009, press release, Eminem would release two new albums that year. Relapse, the first, was released on May 19; its first single and music video, \"We Made You\", was released on April 7. Although Relapse did not sell as well as Eminem\'s previous albums and received mixed reviews, it was a commercial success and re-established his presence in the hip-hop world. It sold more than five million copies worldwide. On October 30 he headlined at the Voodoo Experience in New Orleans, his first full performance of the year. Eminem\'s act included several songs from Relapse, many of his older hits, and an appearance by D12. On November 19, he announced on his website that Relapse: Refill would be released on December 21. The album was a re-release of Relapse with seven bonus tracks, including \"Forever\" and \"Taking My Ball\". Eminem described the CD:\r\n\r\nI want to deliver more material for the fans this year like I originally planned ... Hopefully, these tracks on The Refill will tide the fans over until we put out Relapse 2 next year ... I got back in with Dre and then a few more producers, including Just Blaze, and went in a completely different direction which made me start from scratch. The new tracks started to sound very different than the tracks I originally intended to be on Relapse 2, but I still want the other stuff to be heard.\r\n\r\n2009–2011: Recovery and Bad Meets Evil reunion\r\nOn April 14, 2010, Eminem tweeted: \"There is no Relapse 2\". Although his followers thought he was not releasing an album, he changed its title to Recovery and confirmed this by tweeting \"Recovery\" with a link to his website. He said:\r\n\r\nI had originally planned for Relapse 2 to come out last year. But as I kept recording and working with new producers, the idea of a sequel to Relapse started to make less and less sense to me, and I wanted to make a completely new album. The music on Recovery came out very different from Relapse, and I think it deserves its own title.\r\n\r\nRecorded from 2009 to 2010, Recovery was released on June 18. In the US, Recovery sold 741,000 copies during its first week, topping the Billboard 200 chart. Eminem\'s sixth consecutive US number-one album also topped the charts in several other countries. Recovery remained atop the Billboard 200 chart for five consecutive weeks of a seven-week total.\r\n\r\nBillboard reported that it was the bestselling album of 2010, making Eminem the first artist in Nielsen SoundScan history with two year-end bestselling albums. Recovery is the bestselling digital album in history. Its first single, \"Not Afraid\", was released on April 29 and debuted atop the Billboard Hot 100; its music video was released on June 4. \"Not Afraid\" was followed by \"Love the Way You Lie\", which debuted at number two before rising to the top. Although \"Love the Way You Lie\" was the bestselling 2010 single in the United Kingdom, it did not reach number one (the first time this has happened in the UK since 1969). Despite criticism of its inconsistency, Recovery received positive reviews from most critics. As of November 21, 2010, the album had US sales of three million copies. Recovery was the bestselling album worldwide in 2010, joining 2002\'s bestseller The Eminem Show to give Eminem two worldwide year-end number-one albums. With Recovery, Eminem broke the record for the most successive US number-one albums by a solo artist.\r\n\r\nHe appeared at the 2010 BET Awards, performing \"Not Afraid\" and \"Airplanes, Part II\" with B.o.B and Keyshia Cole. Later that year, he performed at the Activision E3 concert. In June, Eminem and Jay-Z announced they would perform together in Detroit and New York City, at concerts called The Home & Home Tour. The first two concerts quickly sold out, prompting an additional show in each city. BET called Eminem the number-one rapper of the 21st century. He opened the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards on September 12, performing \"Not Afraid\" and \"Love the Way You Lie\" with Rihanna singing the choruses. Due to the success of Recovery and The Home & Home Tour, Eminem was named the 2010 Hottest MC in the Game by MTV and Emcee of the Year by the online magazine HipHopDX. He and Rihanna again collaborated on \"Love the Way You Lie (Part II)\", the sequel to their hit single. Unlike the original, Rihanna is the lead vocalist and it is sung from the female perspective. In December 2010, the \"Great Eminem Recovery\" was number one on Billboard\'s Top 25 Music Moments of 2010. He appeared at the 2011 Grammy Awards on February 13, performing \"Love the Way You Lie (Part II)\" with Rihanna and Adam Levine and \"I Need a Doctor\" with Dr. Dre and Skylar Grey. That month it was announced that \"Space Bound\" would be the fourth single from Recovery, with a music video featuring former porn actress Sasha Grey: the video was released on June 24 on the iTunes Store. In 2010, Eminem again began collaborating with Royce da 5\'9\" on their first EP as Bad Meets Evil; the duo formed in 1998. The EP, Hell: The Sequel, was released on June 14, 2011. Eminem was featured on Royce da 5\'9\"\'s \"Writer\'s Block\", released on April 8, 2011. On May 3 they released the lead single \"Fast Lane\" from their upcoming EP and a music video was filmed. In March 2011, within days of each other, The Eminem Show and The Marshall Mathers LP were certified diamond by the RIAA; Eminem is the only rapper with two diamond-certified albums. With more than 60 million \"likes\" he was the most-followed person on Facebook, outscoring Lady Gaga, Justin Bieber, Rihanna, and Michael Jackson. Eminem was the first artist in five years with two number-one albums (Recovery and Hell: The Sequel) in a 12-month period. Early in 2011, he leaked \"2.0 Boys\", on which Yelawolf and Slaughterhouse collaborated when they signed with Shady Records in January and performed it in April. Bad Meets Evil released their next single, \"Lighters\", on July 6 and its music video in late August. On August 6, Eminem performed several songs from throughout his career at Lollapalooza with the artists who had been featured on each song.\r\n\r\n2012–2014: The Marshall Mathers LP 2\r\nEminem announced on May 24, 2012, that he was working on his next album, scheduled for release the following year. Without a title or release date, it was included on a number of \"Most Anticipated Albums of 2013\" lists (including MTV); Complex ranked it sixth and XXL fifth.\r\n\r\nOn August 14, \"Survival\", featuring Liz Rodrigues and produced by DJ Khalil, premiered in the multi-player trailer for the video game Call of Duty: Ghosts. According to a press release, the first single from Eminem\'s eighth album would be released soon. During the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards, it was announced that the album would be entitled The Marshall Mathers LP 2 (following The Marshall Mathers LP) and was scheduled for release on November 5. Its lead single, \"Berzerk\", was released on August 25 and debuted at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Three more singles followed: \"Survival\" (appearing on the Call of Duty: Ghosts trailer), \"Rap God\" and \"The Monster\" (with Rihanna).\r\n\r\nThe album was released on November 5, by Aftermath Entertainment, Shady Records, and Interscope Records. Its standard version had 16 tracks and the deluxe version included a second disc with five additional tracks. The Marshall Mathers LP 2 was Eminem\'s seventh album to debut atop the Billboard 200 and had the year\'s second-largest first-week sales. He was the first artist since the Beatles to have four singles in the top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100. In the United Kingdom, The Marshall Mathers LP 2 debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart. The first American artist with seven consecutive UK number-one albums, he is tied with the Beatles for second place for the most consecutive chart-topping UK albums. The album secured Eminem\'s position as Canada\'s bestselling artist and was 2013\'s bestselling album.\r\n\r\nOn November 3, Eminem was named the first YouTube Music Awards Artist of the Year, and a week later he received the Global Icon Award at the 2013 MTV Europe Music Awards. On June 10, it was announced that Eminem was the first artist to receive two digital diamond certifications – sales and streams of 10 million and above – by the RIAA (for \"Not Afraid\" and \"Love the Way You Lie\"). On July 11 and 12, Eminem played two concerts at Wembley Stadium. At the 57th Grammy Awards, he received Best Rap Album award for The Marshall Mathers LP 2 and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration (with Rihanna) for \"The Monster\".\r\n\r\n2014–2016: Shady XV and Southpaw (Music from and inspired by the Motion Picture) \r\nIn the summer of 2014, Eminem and Rosenberg began using the hashtag #SHADYXV on social networking sites and Eminem wore a T-shirt with the hashtag onstage. This was later revealed to be the name of an upcoming Shady Records compilation. Shortly afterward the first single from the album (\"Guts Over Fear\", featuring singer-songwriter Sia) was released and the album\'s track list was released on October 29. Shady Records released a cypher to promote the album, in which Eminem did a seven-minute freestyle. \"Detroit vs. Everybody\" (the album\'s second single), with Eminem, Dej Loaf, Royce da 5\'9\", Danny Brown, Big Sean and Trick-Trick, was released on November 11.

The interview streamed online on the Beats 1 radio on July 1, 2015.\r\n\r\nEminem appeared on the public access show Only in Monroe, produced in Monroe, Michigan, and was interviewed by guest host Stephen Colbert for an episode that aired on July 1, 2015. In the episode Eminem sang snippets of Bob Seger songs at Colbert\'s prompting and briefly discussed Southpaw. In June 2015, it was revealed that he will serve as the executive producer and music supervisor on the TV series Motor City whose premise will be based on the 2002 film Narc.\r\n\r\nIn September 2016, Eminem was featured on Skylar Grey\'s song, \"Kill For You\", which appears on her album, Natural Causes. On October 19, 2016, Eminem released a new song called \"Campaign Speech\", a political hip-hop song, and announced he was working on a new album. On November 17, 2016, Eminem released a remastered version of \'Infinite\' on his YouTube VEVO channel. On November 22, 2016, Eminem released a trailer for a 10-minute short documentary called Partners in Rhyme: The True Story of Infinite.\r\n\r\n2017–2019: Revival and Kamikaze\r\nIn February 2017, Eminem appeared on \"No Favors\", a track from Big Sean\'s album I Decided. In the song, Eminem calls the newly elected President Donald Trump a \"bitch\" and also raps about raping conservative social and political commentator Ann Coulter, who is a Trump supporter, with a variety of foreign objects. Coulter responded to the lyrics, stating, \"I think it\'s unfortunate that the left, from Berkeley to Eminemm with his rap songs, has normalized violence against women, as Eminem has done. Eminem participated in the 2017 BET Hip Hop Awards\' annual cypher, using his verse, a freestyle rap called \"The Storm\", to further criticize Trump and the administration for, among other things, Trump\'s focus on National Football League players\' protests during \"The Star Spangled Banner\" over Hurricane Maria recovery efforts and lack of gun control reform in the wake of the 2017 Las Vegas shooting. Eminem ended the cypher by giving an ultimatum saying that Trump supporters cannot be his fans. The verse received wide praise among other rappers following its release. In October 2017, Eminem appeared on \"Revenge\", a track from Pink\'s album Beautiful Trauma. It was reported that the Secret Service interviewed Eminem in 2018–2019, regarding threatening lyrics towards President Trump and daughter Ivanka.\r\n\r\nStarting in late October 2017, Eminem and Paul Rosenberg began teasing what fans speculated was the title of a new album titled Revival, in the form of advertisements for a fake medication of the same name. Later in November, the first single \"Walk on Water\" was released, which featured Beyoncé. The song was first performed, by Eminem, at the 2017 MTV Europe Music Awards on November 12, featuring Skylar Grey. He appeared on Saturday Night Live on November 18, performing \"Walk on Water\", \"Stan\" and \"Love the Way You Lie\" with Skylar Grey. On November 28, Dr. Dre posted a video confirming the album\'s release date as December 15, 2017. On December 8, Eminem released a promotional single titled \"Untouchable\", which featured a sample from the duo Cheech & Chong. Despite an online leak of the album two days prior, Revival was released as planned on December 15. On January 5, 2018, the second single \"River\" was released, which featured Ed Sheeran. It became Eminem\'s eighth consecutive album to top the US Billboard 200 upon release with 197,000 copies sold in its first week. As a result, he became the first musical act to have eight entries in a row debut atop the chart. The album was met with mixed reviews from music critics and is generally considered his worst album. In 2018, an extended edition of \"Nowhere Fast\" with Kehlani and a remix of \"Chloraseptic\" featuring 2 Chainz and Phresher were released from Revival.\r\n\r\nOn August 31, 2018, Eminem released his tenth studio album and first surprise album Kamikaze, making it his second full-length studio album in 8 months. The album topped the Billboard 200, making it his ninth album in a row to do so, after selling 434,000 units in the first week. The album was released as a response to criticism of Revival, his worst-rated album. The album was promoted with three singles: \"Fall\" and \"Venom\", from the 2018 film of the same name, and \"Lucky You\". During the October 15, 2018, episode of the late-night television show Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Eminem performed the song \"Venom\" on the 103rd floor of the Empire State Building in New York City as a promotion of the album.\r\n\r\nOn December 1, Eminem released an 11-minute freestyle to his YouTube channel titled \'Kick off\'. Eminem collaborated with several artists throughout early 2019, including Boogie, Logic, Ed Sheeran, 50 Cent, and Conway the Machine. On February 23, 2019, to celebrate its 20th anniversary, Eminem released a re-issue of The Slim Shady LP, including acapella, instrumentals, and radio-edited versions of tracks from the album.\r\n\r\n2020–2023: Music to Be Murdered By and Curtain Call 2\r\nOn January 17, 2020, Eminem released another surprise album Music to Be Murdered By. Recorded from 2019 to 2020, the album features guest appearances by Young M.A., Royce da 5\'9\", Q-Tip, Denaun Porter, White Gold, Ed Sheeran, Juice WRLD, Skylar Grey, Anderson.Paak, Don Toliver, Kxng Crooked, Joell Ortiz, and Black Thought. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling 279,000 album-equivalent units in its first week. Subsequently, Eminem became the first artist to have ten consecutive albums debut at number one in the US and one of six artists to have released at least ten US number-one albums. Music critics praised Eminem\'s lyrical abilities and the improved production after Kamikaze, while criticism was directed towards the album\'s formulaic song structure, lack of innovation, and shock value.\r\n\r\nThe lyrics of \"Unaccommodating\", in which Eminem referenced the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing, drew significant criticism, with many critics finding the lyrics objectionable. The mayor of Manchester denounced the song\'s lyrics, describing them as \"unnecessarily hurtful and deeply disrespectful\". The lyrics also drew widespread criticism from victims\' relatives and others involved in the attack. On February 9, 2020, Mathers performed \"Lose Yourself\" at the 92nd Academy Awards. On March 9, 2020, the music video for the song \"Godzilla\" was released on YouTube through Lyrical Lemonade\'s channel. The video features Mike Tyson and Dr. Dre.

On July 9, 2020, Kid Cudi\'s daughter Vada announced via social media that he was releasing a song with Eminem called \"The Adventures of Moon Man & Slim Shady\" the coming Friday.\r\n\r\nA deluxe edition of the album, titled Music to Be Murdered By – Side B, was released on December 18, 2020. Similar to Eminem\'s previous two albums, it was released without any prior announcement. It contains a bonus disc with sixteen new tracks, with guest appearances by Skylar Grey, DJ Premier, Ty Dolla Sign, Dr. Dre, Sly Pyper, MAJ, and White Gold. The album\'s release was accompanied by a music video for \"Gnat\", directed by Cole Bennett. Lyric videos for \"Alfred\'s Theme\" and \"Tone Deaf\" were also released, in the latter song Mathers pays tribute to the late Chicago rapper King Von. Music to Be Murdered By – Side B debuted on the Billboard 200 at number 3, with 70,000–80,000 album-equivalent units, including 25,000–30,000 in pure album sales. In the track \"Zeus\", he apologizes to Rihanna over a leaked song from his Relapse studio sessions in which he sided with Chris Brown, who pleaded guilty to felony assault involving her in 2009.\r\n\r\nEminem featured in a song with Polo G and Mozzy called \"Last One Standing\" by Skylar Grey for the soundtrack of the film Venom: Let There Be Carnage, released on September 30, 2021. He performed alongside LL Cool J at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ceremony on October 30.[citation needed] On February 13, 2022, Eminem performed at the Super Bowl LVI halftime show alongside Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Kendrick Lamar, and Mary J. Blige, with surprise appearances from 50 Cent and Anderson.

The album covers his albums from Relapse to Music to Be Murdered By, as well as collaborations and songs from movie soundtracks. It was released on August 5, 2022, and also includes \"The King and I\", \"From the D 2 the LBC\", and an additional new track named \"Is This Love (\'09)\" featuring 50 Cent.\r\n\r\nOn August 26, 2022, Eminem was featured alongside Kanye West on the remix of the song \"Use This Gospel\" on DJ Khaled\'s new album God Did. The remix was originally set to be released on West\'s shelved album Jesus Is King Part II. Eminem was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2022. He was presented by Dr. Dre and had special guest appearances by Aerosmith lead vocalist Steven Tyler and Ed Sheeran during his performance.\r\n\r\n2024-present: The Death of Slim Shady (Coup De Grâce)\r\nEminem featured on Lyrical Lemonade\'s song \"Doomsday Pt. 2\", it\'s was released on January 26, 2024, with a music video premiering on YouTube on March 13. The song features disses aimed at Benzino, who has had a long-time beef with Eminem, with lines like \"I have a riddle, one condition you mustn\'t laugh. What is the opposite of Benzino? A giraffe\". The disses are a response to Benzino\'s track \"Rap Elvis\".\r\n\r\nDuring an episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live! on March 19, 2024, Dr. Dre stated that Eminem intended to release a new album that year. On April 25, Eminem appeared alongside Roger Goodell at the opening ceremony of the 2024 NFL draft in Detroit. At the same time, Eminem announced a twelfth studio album titled The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grâce), with a planned release later in the year. The trailer for the album, which was shown on the NFL Network, briefly discusses the \"murder\" of the Slim Shady persona in a true crime format. 50 Cent is also featured in a cameo role. The album is produced by Eminem, Dr. Dre and The ICU. \r\n\r\nOn May 28, 2024, the rapper posted a joint Instagram video with magician David Blaine. The video shows a video call between Eminem and Blaine, with the former asking for help and a magic trick to which the latter responds by eating a glass of wine. The rapper then previews the track \"Houdini\" by playing a short instrumental snippet. At the end of the clip, the song title and release date are revealed. It was released on May 31, 2024, as the lead single. It topped the charts in many countries, as well as debuting at number 1 on the Billboard Global 200 and number 2 on the Hot 100. On June 28, 2024, Eminem posted a teaser for the album\'s second single, titled \"Tobey\" and featuring fellow Detroit rappers Big Sean and BabyTron. The short black-and-white clip depicted the rapper wearing a Jason mask and wielding a chainsaw while standing next to the featured artists, with an instrumental snippet playing in the background. The song released on July 2, with an accompanying music video produced by Cole Bennett to follow on July 5. The track title is a reference to actor Tobey Maguire, best known for his role in the Spider-Man films; the single art is also a reference to the iconic \"3 Spiderman pointing\" meme.\r\n\r\nArtistry:\r\nInfluences, style, and rapping technique\r\nEminem has cited several MCs as influencing his rapping style, including Esham, Kool G Rap, Masta Ace, Big Daddy Kane, Tupac Shakur, Newcleus, Ice-T, Mantronix, Melle Mel (on \"The Message\"), LL Cool J, Beastie Boys, Run-D.M.C., Rakim and Boogie Down Productions. In How to Rap, Guerilla Black notes that Eminem studied other MCs to hone his rapping technique: \"Eminem listened to everything and that\'s what made him one of the greats\". In the book, other MCs also praise aspects of his rapping technique: varied, humorous subject matter, connecting with his audience, carrying a concept over a series of albums, complex rhyme schemes, bending words so they rhyme, multisyllabic rhymes, many rhymes to a bar, complex rhythms, clear enunciation, and the use of melody and syncopation. Eminem is known to write most of his lyrics on paper (documented in The Way I Am), taking several days or a week to craft lyrics, being a \"workaholic\" and \"stacking\" vocals. Examples of hip hop subgenres that Eminem\'s music has been described as include horrorcore, comedy hip hop, and hardcore hip hop. Eminem also incorporates rap-rock into his music and has cited rock acts during the 1970s and 1980s, such as Jimi Hendrix and Led Zeppelin, as influences in his music.\r\nAlter egos\r\nEminem uses alter egos in his songs for different rapping styles and subject matter. His best-known alter ego, Slim Shady, first appeared on  The Slim Shady EP and was in The Slim Shady LP, The Marshall Mathers LP, The Eminem Show, Encore, Relapse, The Marshall Mathers LP 2, Kamikaze and Music to Be Murdered By. In this persona, his songs are violent and dark, with a comic twist. Eminem downplayed Slim Shady on Recovery because he felt it did not fit the album\'s theme. Another character is Ken Kaniff, a gay man who pokes fun at Eminem\'s songs. Ken was created and originally played by fellow Detroit rapper Aristotle on The Slim Shady LP, where Kaniff makes a prank call to Eminem. An argument after the album\'s release prompted Eminem to use the Kaniff character on Marshall Mathers and later albums (except Encore and Recovery). Aristotle, angry with Eminem\'s use of his character, released a mixtape in his Kaniff persona ridiculing him.\r\nCollaborations and productions\r\nAlthough Eminem usually collaborates with Aftermath Entertainment and Shady Records rappers such as Dr. Dre, 50 Cent, D12, Obie Trice and Yelawolf, he has also worked with Redman, Kid Rock, DMX, Lil Wayne, Missy Elliott, Jay Z, Drake, Rihanna, Nas, Nicki Minaj, Xzibit, Method Man, Jadakiss, Fat Joe, Sticky Fingaz, T.I. and Young Jeezy. Eminem rapped a verse in a live performance of Busta Rhymes\' \"Touch It\" remix at the 2006 BET Music Awards. He appeared on Akon\'s single \"Smack That\" from Konvicted, Lil Wayne\'s hit \"Drop the World\" and \"My Life\" (the lead single from 50 Cent\'s Street King Immortal).\r\n\r\nEminem was the executive producer of D12\'s first two albums (Devil\'s Night and D12 World), Obie Trice\'s Cheers and Second Round\'s on Me and 50 Cent\'s Get Rich or Die Tryin\' and The Massacre. He has produced songs for other rappers such as Jadakiss\' \"Welcome To D-Block\", Jay-Z\'s \"Renegade\" and \"Moment of Clarity\", Lloyd Banks\' \"On Fire\", \"Warrior Part 2\" and \"Hands Up\", Tony Yayo\'s \"Drama Setter\", Trick-Trick\'s \"Welcome 2 Detroit\" and Xzibit\'s \"My Name\" and \"Don\'t Approach Me\". Most of The Eminem Show was produced by Eminem and his longtime collaborator, Jeff Bass, and Eminem co-produced Encore with Dr. Dre. In 2004, Eminem was co-executive producer of 2Pac\'s posthumous album Loyal to the Game with Shakur\'s mother, Afeni. He produced the UK number-one single \"Ghetto Gospel\", featuring Elton John; \"The Cross\", from the Nas album God\'s Son; and eight tracks on Obie Trice\'s 2006 album Second Round\'s on Me (also appearing on \"There They Go\"). Eminem produced several tracks on Trick-Trick\'s The Villain (appearing on \"Who Want It\") and produced four tracks on Cashis\' 2013 album The County Hound 2.\r\n\r\nEminem has only produced for and appeared on one track with former Aftermath/Interscope labelmate The Game; \"We Ain\'t\" (a track from Game\'s January 2005 debut album, The Documentary). In 2022, Game would later release a ten-minute diss track towards Eminem titled \"The Black Slim Shady\".\r\n\r\nEminem is considered unusual in structuring his songs around the lyrics, rather than writing to beats. One exception was \"Stan\", which came from an idea and scratch track produced by the 45 King. After doing little production on Relapse and Recovery, Eminem produced a significant portion of The Marshall Mathers LP 2. He said about producing his own music, \"Sometimes, I may get something in my head, like an idea or the mood of something that I would want, and I\'m not always gonna get that by going through different tracks that other people have made. They don\'t know what\'s in my head. I think maybe it helps, a little bit, with diversity, the sound of it, but also, I would get something in my head and want to be able to lay down that idea from scratch. In 1998 when his beef with rapper Cage was still happening, New York rapper Necro (who had previously produced three songs for Cage) met Eminem and gave him a CD with the beat to what eventually became the beat for the song \"Black Helicopters\" by rap group Non-Phixion. Despite Eminem never using it, Necro still said positive things about Eminem and would appear on Shade45 years later.\r\nComparisons with other artists:\r\nAs a white performer prominent in a genre influenced by black artists, Eminem has been compared, much to his chagrin, to Elvis Presley, and has lyrically been compared to Bob Dylan. Rapper Asher Roth has been compared to Eminem and Roth devoted a song on his album (\"As I Em\") to him, which he took offense to. The accomplished trumpeter Nicholas Payton has called Eminem \"the Bix Beiderbecke of hip hop\".\r\n\r\nOther ventures:\r\nFollowing Eminem\'s multiplatinum record sales, Interscope offered him his own label; he and Paul Rosenberg founded Shady Records in late 1999. Eminem signed his Detroit collective, D12, and rapper Obie Trice to the label and signed 50 Cent in a 2002 joint venture with Dr. Dre\'s Aftermath label. In 2003, Eminem and Dr. Dre added Atlanta rapper Stat Quo to the Shady-Aftermath roster. DJ Green Lantern, Eminem\'s former DJ, was with Shady Records until a dispute related to the 50 Cent-Jadakiss feud forced him to leave the label. The Alchemist is currently Eminem\'s tour DJ. In 2005 Eminem signed another Atlanta rapper, Bobby Creekwater, and West Coast rapper Cashis to Shady Records.\r\n\r\nOn December 5, 2006, the compilation album Eminem Presents The Re-Up was released on Shady Records. The project began as a mixtape, but when Eminem found the material better than expected he released it as an album. The Re-Up was intended to introduce Stat Quo, Cashis, and Bobby Creekwater. While he was recording Infinite, Eminem, Proof, and Kon Artis assembled a group of fellow rappers now known as D12, short for \"Detroit Twelve\" or \"Dirty Dozen\", who performed in a style similar to Wu-Tang Clan. In 2001 D12\'s debut album, Devil\'s Night, was released. The first single from the album was \"Shit on You\", followed by \"Purple Pills\" (an ode to recreational drug use) and \"Fight Music\". \"Purple Pills\" was rewritten for radio and television, removing many of the song\'s references to drugs and sex, and renamed \"Purple Hills\".\r\n\r\nAfter their debut, D12 took a three-year break from the studio. They reunited in 2004 for their second album,D12 World, which included the hit singles \"My Band\" and \"How Come\". \"American Psycho 2\" featuring Cypress Hill member, B-Real, was another popular hit. According to D12 member Bizarre, Eminem was not featured on his album Blue Cheese & Coney Island because \"he\'s busy doing his thing\".\r\n\r\nIn January 2014, Bass Brothers announced that D12 had returned to record at F.B.T. Studio and they were working on an album with Eminem on at least three songs. Bizarre reported that he was still part of the group and that the album was scheduled for a 2014 release.\r\nShade 45\r\nEminem established his own satellite radio channel, Shade 45, that plays uncut hip-hop. Eminem also established a new morning show, Sway in the Morning with Sway Calloway, a lively morning show that airs at 8:00 a.m., Monday–Friday.\r\n\r\nEminem promoted the station in a 2004 mock national convention (the \"Shady National Convention\") at the Roseland Ballroom in New York City, in which Donald Trump endorsed him. On his album Revival (2017), Eminem expressed his regret at having collaborated with Trump, rapping, \"wish I would have spit on it before I went to shake his hand at the event\".\r\nMom\'s Spaghetti Restaurant\r\nOn September 29, 2021, Eminem and Union Joints opened a spaghetti restaurant at 2131 Woodward Ave in Detroit. It is a reference to the lyrics \"His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy / There\'s vomit on his sweater already, mom\'s spaghetti\" from the song \"Lose Yourself\" which became an internet meme. Mom\'s Spaghetti was previously a pop-up in Detroit in 2017 and at Coachella in 2018.\r\n\r\nIn 2023, Eminem announced the launch of a \"Mom\'s Spaghetti\" jarred pasta sauce.\r\nActing career\r\nAfter small roles in the 2001 film The Wash and as an extra in the 1998 Korn music video for \"Got the Life\" (during which he gave the band a demo tape), Eminem made his Hollywood debut in the semi-autobiographical 2002 film 8 Mile. He said it was a representation of growing up in Detroit rather than an account of his life. He recorded several new songs for the soundtrack, including \"Lose Yourself\" (which won an Academy Award for Best Original Song in 2003 and became the longest-running No. 1 hip hop single in history).[298] Eminem was absent from the ceremony and co-composer Luis Resto accepted the award.[299]\r\n\r\nEminem voiced an aging, corrupt, Ebonics-speaking police officer in the video game 50 Cent: Bulletproof and guested on the Comedy Central television show Crank Yankers and a Web cartoon, The Slim Shady Show He was signed to star in an unmade film version of Have Gun – Will Travel, and was considered for the role of David Rice in the 2008 film Jumper. Eminem had a cameo appearance, arguing with Ray Romano, in the 2009 film Funny People. In a 2010 interview with Jonathan Ross, he stated \"You know, I love music so much. This is my passion, this is what I want to do. Not saying that I won\'t do a movie ever again, but this is me.\"\r\n\r\nHe played himself in the Entourage season-seven finale \"Lose Yourself\" with Christina Aguilera. Although Eminem was offered the lead role in the 2013 science-fiction film Elysium, he turned it down because director Neill Blomkamp would not change its location from Los Angeles to Detroit. Eminem had a cameo appearance as himself in the 2014 film The Interview. During an interview with the main character, Dave Skylark (James Franco), Eminem satirically comes out as gay.\r\nCharity work\r\nEminem established the Marshall Mathers Foundation to aid disadvantaged youth. The foundation works in conjunction with a charity founded by Norman Yatooma, a Detroit attorney. During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, he donated a pair of Air Jordan 4 Retro Eminem Carhartt shoes, which are rare, to be raffled off with proceeds going to COVID-19 relief. That same year, he donated \"mom\'s spaghetti\", a reference to a line in his song \"Lose Yourself\", to healthcare workers at Henry Ford Health System in Detroit.\r\nAdvertising\r\nEminem appeared in two commercials that were shown during Super Bowl XLV. In the first, a one-minute spot for Lipton\'s Brisk iced tea, he is a claymation figure. In the second, a two-minute ad – the longest in Super Bowl history at the time – for the Chrysler 200, Eminem drives through Detroit (with \"Lose Yourself\" as the soundtrack) to his show at the Fox Theatre.\r\nBooks and memoirs\r\nOn November 21, 2000, Eminem published Angry Blonde, a non-fiction book featuring a commentary of several of his own songs, along with several previously unpublished photographs.\r\n\r\nOn October 21, 2008, his autobiography The Way I Am was published. The book was first published on October 21, 2008, by Dutton Adult. It is a collection of Eminem\'s personal stories, reflections, photographs, original artwork, and original lyric sheets from \"Stan\" and \"The Real Slim Shady\". It details his struggles with poverty, drugs, fame, heartbreak, family, and depression, along with stories about his rise to fame and commentary on past controversies. The book is illustrated with never-before-published photos of Eminem\'s life. It also contains original drawings, previously unpublished lyric sheets, and other rare memorabilia. The autobiography is named after the song of the same name.\r\n\r\nAn autobiography of Eminem\'s mother (My Son Marshall, My Son Eminem) was published the following month, in which Debbie Nelson describes her childhood and adolescence, meeting Eminem\'s father, and her son\'s rise to (and struggles with) fame.\r\n\r\nPersonal life:\r\nFamily and relationships\r\nHe was twice married to Kimberly Anne Scott; he met Scott in high school while he stood on a table with his shirt off rapping LL Cool J\'s \"I\'m Bad\". Scott and her twin sister had run away from home; they moved in with Eminem and his mother when he was 15 and he began an on-and-off relationship with Scott in 1989.\r\n\r\nMathers and Scott were married in 1999 and divorced in 2001. Although Eminem told Rolling Stone in 2002, \"I would rather have a baby through my penis than get married again\", he and Scott briefly remarried in January 2006. He filed for divorce in early April, agreeing to joint custody of Hailie. Their daughter, Hailie Jade is a social media influencer, specifically for fashion and beauty.\r\n\r\nEminem legally adopted and was given custody of his sister-in-law\'s daughter, as well as Scott\'s child from an affair. He also raised his younger half-brother Nathan.\r\n\r\nEminem and actress Brittany Murphy dated in the 2000s. He stated in 2002 that he had been dating singer Mariah Carey, though she later denied it. In 2005, he played alleged voicemails of her during the The Anger Management Tour and stated in 2006 that he had dated her for six to seven months, but the two broke up due to the differences in their personalities.\r\n\r\nIn early 2010, Eminem denied tabloid reports that he and Scott had renewed their romantic relationship; however, in the same statement, his representative also confirmed that they now maintain a friendly relationship.\r\n\r\nIn his 2013 song \"Headlights\", Eminem reiterated his love for his mother and apologized to her for some of the lyrics from his songs, with \"Cleanin\' Out My Closet\" being specifically named.\r\nHealth problems\r\nEminem has spoken publicly about his addiction to prescription drugs, including Vicodin, Ambien, and Valium. According to friend and fellow D12 member Proof, Eminem first straightened out in 2002. During the production of 8 Mile, Eminem, working 16 hours a day, developed insomnia. An associate gave him an Ambien tablet which \"knocked [him] out\", encouraging him to obtain a prescription. This was Eminem\'s first experience of drug addiction, which would affect him for several years. Near the end of production on Encore, he would \"just go into the studio and goof off [with] a pocketful of pills\". Eminem began taking the drugs to \"feel normal\", taking a \"ridiculous amount ... I could consume anywhere from 40 to 60 Valium [in a day]. Vicodin, maybe 30.\" The drugs would put him to sleep for no more than two hours, after which he would take more. Eminem\'s weight increased to 230 pounds (100 kg) and he was regularly eating fast food: \"The kids behind the counter knew me — it wouldn\'t even faze them. Or I\'d sit up at Denny\'s or Big Boy and just eat by myself. It was sad.\" Eminem became less recognizable due to his weight gain and once overheard two teenagers arguing about whether or not it was him: \"Eminem ain\'t fat\".\r\nIn December 2007, Eminem was hospitalized after a methadone overdose. He had first bought from a dealer who had told him it was \"just like Vicodin, and easier on [your] liver\". He continued to buy more until he collapsed in his bathroom one night and was rushed to the hospital. Doctors there told him he had ingested the equivalent of four bags of heroin and was \"about two hours from dying\". After missing Christmas with his children, Hailie, Alaina, and Stevie, Eminem checked himself out of the facility, weak and not fully detoxed. He tore the meniscus in his knee after falling asleep on his sofa, requiring surgery; after he returned home, he had a seizure. His drug use \"ramped right back to where it was before\" within a month. Eminem began to attend church meetings to get clean, but after he was asked for autographs he sought help from a rehabilitation counselor. He began an exercise program that emphasized running. Elton John was a mentor during this period, calling Eminem once a week to check on him. Eminem has been sober since April 20, 2008.\r\nThreats\r\nIn April 2020, Matthew David Hughes, a 26-year-old homeless man, broke into Eminem\'s house in Clinton Township, Macomb County, Michigan, breaking a kitchen window with a brick paver. Eminem woke up with Hughes standing behind him and he said that he was there to kill him. In a plea agreement in 2021, Hughes pleaded guilty to second-degree home invasion in exchange for dismissal of other charges; he was sentenced to probation and time served (524 days in the county jail). In 2019, Hughes pleaded guilty to breaking into a Rochester Hills home in search of Eminem.\r\n\r\nOn August 23, 2023, it was revealed that the perpetrator of the 2023 Jacksonville shooting Ryan Palmeter targeted Eminem and Machine Gun Kelly as his victims in a racially-motivated attack. Both have yet to respond to these statements.\r\nPolitics\r\nEminem has expressed his Democratic political views in multiple songs; however, he has refrained from direct endorsements of politicians, focusing more on criticisms instead. The first was \"Mosh\", which was released in 2004, a few weeks before the 2004 United States presidential election, and heavily criticized then-president George W. Bush but did not directly endorse John Kerry either. He would not express political views again until the 2016 United States presidential election when he released his \"Campaign Speech\", which criticized presidential candidate Donald Trump. The following year, he criticized Trump in a freestyle titled \"The Storm\". In the freestyle, he expressed support for former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick and the U.S. national anthem protests and expressed his displeasure for any of his fans who support Trump. In his song \"Darkness\", he heavily references the 2017 Las Vegas mass shooting, and at the end of the music video expresses his support for gun control. The week before the 2020 United States presidential election, he approved his song \"Lose Yourself\" to be used in a campaign video for Joe Biden. After the United States Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Eminem posted a tweet to his Twitter expressing his displeasure with the decision saying \"As a father, it pisses me off that women have fewer rights 2day than just a few days ago… we r fuckin goin backward. Here\'s how 2 help in Michigan. [sic]\" and included a link to a pro-choice organization in Michigan. In 2023, he requested that Republican election candidate Vivek Ramaswamy stop rapping his song \"Lose Yourself\" at campaign rallies, sending Ramaswamy a cease and desist letter.\r\nFaith and beliefs\r\nEminem is a Christian, and has rapped about his faith in a few songs, including on the remix to \"Use This Gospel\".\r\nInterests\r\nEminem is a fan of the Detroit Lions and Detroit Pistons. He is also an avid comic book collector. His collection includes Amazing Fantasy #15, which is the comic book that introduces Spider-Man. The comic is worth over $1 million. A former Shady Records executive referred to his collection as \"otherworldly\".\r\n\r\nFeuds:\r\nEminem has had lyrical feuds during his career with many recording artists, including Christina Aguilera, Machine Gun Kelly, Everlast, Cage, Insane Clown Posse, Will Smith, Miilkbone, Mariah Carey, Nick Cannon, Limp Bizkit, Benzino, Ja Rule, Vanilla Ice, Canibus, Jermaine Dupri, Joe Budden, Lord Jamar, and Charlamagne tha God.\r\n\r\nInsane Clown Posse\r\nThe feud with fellow Detroit hip hop duo Insane Clown Posse began in 1997 when Eminem was throwing a party to promote his debut EP, Slim Shady EP. He gave Joseph Bruce (aka Violent J from Insane Clown Posse) a flyer that stated \"Featuring appearances by Esham, Kid Rock, and ICP (maybe)\". Bruce asked why Eminem was promoting a possible Insane Clown Posse appearance without first contacting the group. Eminem explained, \"It says \'maybe.\' Maybe you will be there; I don\'t know. That\'s why I\'m asking you right now. You guys comin\' to my release party, or what? Bruce, upset over not being consulted, responded, \"Fuck no, I ain\'t coming to your party. We might have, if you would\'ve asked us first, before putting us on the fuckin\' flyer like this.\r\n\r\nEminem took Bruce\'s response as a personal offense, subsequently attacking the group in radio interviews. Bruce and Utsler responded with a parody of Eminem\'s \"My Name Is\" entitled \"Slim Anus\" and other tracks including \"Nuttin\' But a Bitch Thang\" and \"Please Don\'t Hate Me\". Eminem insulted Insane Clown Posse on various tracks from his album The Marshall Mathers LP (2000), including \"Marshall Mathers\" and \"Ken Kaniff\". In 2002, Eminem briefly dissed them on his single \"Business\" from The Eminem Show.\r\n\r\nInsane Clown Posse talked about the feud being squashed in an interview with MTV, saying that Proof squashed the conflict in 2005, which was followed by a bowling game between members of D12 and Psychopathic Records. Violent J stated, \"He contacted us and we had a bowling game – it was really cool. We\'re something different. They could have skipped over us and said forget them, but they included us and said let\'s squash it.\r\nEverlast and Limp Bizkit\r\nIn the early 2000s, Eminem was notified while on the The Anger Management Tour that former House Of Pain member Everlast had mocked him on a song. Everlast claimed that while passing by Mathers in a hotel lobby, Mathers gave him a \"weird look\". Everlast\'s verse from the Dilated Peoples all-star track \"Ear Drums Pop (Remix)\" contained a thinly veiled reference to Eminem (\"Cock my hammer, spit a comet-like Haley/I buck a .380 on ones that act shady\") and went on to warn \"You might catch a beatdown out where I come from\" in his recounting of the incident. Taking offense to this, Eminem and D12 quickly began work on a retaliatory song, \"I Remember\", which ripped Everlast several times in public and with the song.\r\n\r\nEminem and his group D12 responded with \"Quitter\", the second half of which is a take-off on 2Pac\'s iconic diss track \"Hit \'Em Up\" (a diss song aimed at The Notorious B.I.G.). The track ends with the spoken words, \"Fuck him, that\'s it, I\'m done, I promise, I\'m done, that\'s it.\"\r\n\r\nIt was reported that long-time friends of Eminem, nu metal group Limp Bizkit, were meant to be featured on the song, but lead singer Fred Durst canceled at the last moment. The record continued it\'s release without the group, causing the Everlast-Mathers dispute to continue. In a TRL interview, Limp Bizkit member DJ Lethal made a statement that if Mathers and Everlast were to fight in real life, Everlast would win. This would lead to an insulting track aimed at both Everlast and Limp Bizkit (namely Durst and Lethal) appearing on D12\'s 2001 mainstream debut album, Devil\'s Night, as the track \"Girls\".\r\n\r\nRecently, things seem to have settled and Eminem has no longer been heard insulting Everlast or Limp Bizkit. It is currently unknown if the dispute is resolved.\r\nCanibus\r\nThe animus with rapper Canibus started when he and Haitian musician Wyclef Jean confronted Eminem and asked him if he had ghost-wrote the track \"The Ripper Strikes Back\" by LL Cool J. Eminem denied that he wrote the track. After he was confronted, he said Canibus was \"rude\" to him.\r\n\r\nTwo years later, Canibus went to see Eminem on the Warped Tour and apologized to him for his reactions, and asked him if he still wanted the track. Eminem agreed, but when he heard the track \"Phuck U\" from Canibus\' album 2000 B.C., he thought the track was directed at him and LL Cool J. Shortly afterward, Eminem released his third album The Marshall Mathers LP (2000) and Canibus decided to continue the \"story\" of Eminem\'s single \"Stan\". He titled the track \"U Didn\'t Care\" and it continued to take shots at Eminem. Eminem decided to take more shots at Canibus on his album The Eminem Show (2002) on tracks such as \"Say What You Say\", \"When The Music Stops\" and \"Square Dance\". Even though Canibus did not immediately respond to the tracks, Eminem continued to take shots at him, including \"My Name\", a track that Eminem was featured on Xzibit\'s album Man vs. Machine (2002).\r\n\r\nOn November 19, 2002, Canibus responded with the track titled \"Dr.C Ph.D.\". Over a year later Eminem released the track \"Can-I-Bitch\". He attacked Canibus in a humorous matter. Since then the hostilities have cooled down, but Canibus tried to provoke a reignition of it when he leaked a track titled \"Air Strike (Pop Killer)\", that featured vocal parts of D12, where Canibus takes shots at Eminem and his deceased friend Proof. D12 member Swift responded to the record publicly and had the following to say about DZK (another rapper featured on the track). \"[He] asked us to do a track with him when he already was teamed up with Canibus without us knowing. They dissed Em, took our verses, and added them to the song, so they could bring traffic and make it seem like we were turning on Em [...] as a desperate attempt to be heard after ducking and dodging Em for 7 years. It was a straight-hoe move.\r\nMichael Jackson\r\nThe 2004 music video for \"Just Lose It\" generated controversy by parodying pop icon Michael Jackson\'s child molestation trial, plastic surgery, and an incident in which Jackson\'s hair caught on fire while filming a Pepsi commercial in 1984.[360] It was banned on the BET channel, after complaints from Benzino and others (but was later reinstated, as critics of the ban argued that Nelly\'s \"Tip Drill\" video could be seen). Both were only seen on BET: Uncut. However, MTV did not drop it, and the video became one of the most requested on the channel. A week after the release of \"Just Lose It\", Jackson called into the radio show Steve Harvey to report his displeasure with the video. \"I am very angry at Eminem\'s depiction of me in his video\", Jackson said in the interview. \"I feel that it is outrageous and disrespectful. It is one thing to spoof, but it is another to be demeaning and insensitive.\" The singer continued: \"I\'ve admired Eminem as an artist, and was shocked by this. The video was inappropriate and disrespectful to me, my children, my family, and the community at large.\"[361] Many of Jackson\'s supporters and friends spoke out about the video, including Stevie Wonder, who called the video \"kicking a man while he\'s down\" and \"bullshit\", and Steve Harvey, who declared, \"Eminem has lost his ghetto pass. We want the pass back.\r\nJa Rule\r\nEminem\'s conflict with rapper Ja Rule started after 50 Cent signed to Shady Records and Aftermath. Ja Rule stated that he had a problem with Eminem and Dr. Dre signed someone he had a conflict with. On November 19, Ja Rule and Irv Gotti were special guests on Star and Bucwild\'s morning show on Hot 97 NYC. Gotti claimed to have \"legal documents\" referring to an order of protection 50 Cent \"has on him\". Ja Rule threatened, that if 50 Cent released any diss track, he would take action towards his two producers. However, Dr. Dre was the one who produced 50 Cent\'s track \"Back Down\" in 2003 from the album Get Rich Or Die Tryin\', which included lyrics insulting not only Murder Inc., but also Ja Rule\'s family; in the song, he raps, \"Your Mami, your Papi, that bitch you chasin\' your lil dirty ass kids, I\'ll fuckin\' erase them.\r\n\r\nFellow rapper Busta Rhymes decided to join the conflict when he was featured on the track \"Hail Mary 2003\", with Eminem and 50 Cent.\r\n\r\nThe feud intensified when Ja Rule released a diss called \"Loose Change\", in which he took shots at 50 Cent as well as Eminem (calling him \"Feminem\") and Dr. Dre (accusing him of being \"bisexual\" and having a fetish for transvestites - \"bringing transvestites home\"). It includes also the lyrics insulting Eminem\'s family, including his then-eight-year-old daughter Hailie Jade: \"Em you claim your mother\'s a crack head and Kim is a known slut, so what\'s Hailie gonna be when she grows up? Eminem, along with D12 and Obie Trice, responded with the track \"Doe Rae Me\" (aka \"Hailie\'s Revenge\"). Since then, the rift has allegedly cooled down.\r\nBenzino and The Source magazine\r\nIn 2003, rapper and The Source co-owner Benzino released a diss single titled \"Pull Your Skirt Up\" which took aim at Eminem. The track attacked Eminem\'s \"street cred\" and accused him of being a tool of the music industry. Eminem had been discovered by The Source after writer Rigo Morales featured him in the magazine\'s famed monthly \"Unsigned Hype\" column.\r\n\r\nIn the same year, The Source released an article written by Kimberly Osorio, which identified and researched the history of an old demo tape that the magazine discovered where Eminem insulted Black women and used the word \"nigger\". The demo featured a song called \"Foolish Pride\", recorded in the late 1980s when Eminem claimed to have been \"dumped\" by his African-American then-girlfriend. Eminem responded with two tracks titled \"Nail in the Coffin\" and \"The Sauce\". Benzino would later release more tracks. As a result of the conflict, Shady/Aftermath ads were pulled from the magazine. XXL, another hip hop magazine that had featured negative coverage of Shady/Aftermath artists since Eminem mocked them in his song \"Marshall Mathers\" from his 2000 album The Marshall Mathers LP, stepped in to fill the void, accepting Shady/Aftermath ads.\r\nMariah Carey and Nick Cannon\r\nEminem has written several songs referring to a relationship with R&B singer Mariah Carey, although she denies that they were ever intimate. Eminem has referenced her in many songs, including \"When the Music Stops\", \"Superman\", \"Jimmy Crack Corn\", \"Bagpipes from Baghdad\" and \"The Warning\". While \"Superman\" was released in 2003, Carey released a song entitled \"Clown\" on her album Charmbracelet, released in 2002, which makes similar references in line with her 2009 hit \"Obsessed\".\r\n\r\nEminem\'s \"Bagpipes from Baghdad\" from his album Relapse disparages Carey and rapper/then-husband Nick Cannon\'s relationship. Cannon responded to Eminem by saying his career is based on \"racist bigotry\" and that he would get revenge on Eminem, joking that he may return to rapping. Eminem later stated that the couple misinterpreted the track and it was wishing the two the best. Cannon also stated that there were no hard feelings and that he just had to express his feelings about the song.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Carey released \"Obsessed\", about an obsessed man who claims to have been in a relationship with her. Cannon claimed that the song was not an insult directed at Eminem. However, Eminem responded in late July 2009 by releasing a track titled \"The Warning\". It contained samples of voice mail recordings that Eminem claimed were left by Carey when the two were dating. Eminem also hinted that he had other evidence of their relationship in his possession. A little over a year later in September 2010, Cannon responded with the song \"I\'m a Slick Rick\", making fun of Eminem.\r\nMoby\r\nAfter the release of Eminem\'s 2000 album The Marshall Mathers LP, popular electronic music artist Moby began speaking out against the album\'s lyrics, citing references to misogyny and homophobia as unacceptable. Eminem responded back with insulting Moby in \"Without Me\", the lead single off his next album The Eminem Show.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, Moby praised Eminem for criticizing then-U.S. president George W. Bush in the song \"Mosh\", a track from Encore. The feud has since ended.\r\nMachine Gun Kelly\r\nEminem and rapper Machine Gun Kelly have had an ongoing feud for several years, and Kelly released a diss track in response to \"Not Alike\" titled \"Rap Devil\" on September 3; both songs were produced by Ronny J. Kelly continued the feud at a concert, calling it \"a battle between the past and the fucking future\". The song\'s title refers to Eminem\'s \"Rap God\" and Eminem went into the studio days later to record his own response, as did former D12 associate Bizarre. Eminem responded with \"Killshot\" on September 14 and Bizarre\'s \"Love Tap\" was released on September 20. \"Killshot\" garnered 38.1 million streams on YouTube in its first 24 hours and over 80 million views in its first week, making it the most successful debut for a hip-hop song and the third-biggest debut in the platform\'s history. The track also debuted at number 3 on the Billboard Hot 100, making it Eminem\'s 20th top 10 hit on the Billboard Hot 100. Kelly has continued the feud publicly.\r\nFrom Kamikaze\r\nThroughout the 2018 album Kamikaze Eminem\'s lyrics criticize other musicians, primarily mumble rappers, and several have responded publicly. Ja Rule responded on social media, re-igniting a feud the two had 15 years prior. 6ix9ine, Iggy Azalea, Joe Budden, Die Antwoord, Lupe Fiasco, and Lord Jamar have also responded publicly, with 6ix9ine releasing the skit \"Legend\" that raps over Eminem\'s \"Lose Yourself\".\r\n\r\nControversies:\r\nLegal issues\r\nEminem had his first run-in with the law at age 20 when he was arrested for his involvement in a drive-by shooting with a paintball gun. The case was dismissed when the victim did not appear in court.\r\n\r\nOn June 3, 2000, Eminem was arrested during an altercation with Douglas Dail at a car audio store in Royal Oak, Michigan, when he pulled out an unloaded gun and pointed it at the ground. The next day, in Warren, Michigan, he was arrested again for assaulting John Guerra in the parking lot of the Hot Rock Café when he saw him kissing his wife. Eminem recreated the Guerra assault in \"The Kiss (Skit)\" on The Eminem Show. He pleaded guilty to possession of a concealed weapon and assault, receiving two years\' probation; however, Guerra\'s assault charge was dropped as part of the plea agreement. On June 28, 2001, Eminem was sentenced to one year\'s probation and community service and was fined about $2,000 on weapon charges stemming from an argument with an employee of Psychopathic Records.\r\n\r\nIn 1999, Eminem\'s mother sued him for $10 million, claiming he was slandering her on The Slim Shady LP. Litigation concluded in 2001, resulting in an award of $1,600 for her damages.\r\n\r\nOn July 7, 2000, Kim Mathers attempted suicide by slitting her wrists, later suing Eminem for defamation after describing her violent death in \"Kim\".\r\n\r\nSanitation worker DeAngelo Bailey sued Eminem for $1 million in 2001, accusing him of invading his privacy by publicizing information and placing him in a false light in \"Brain Damage\", a song that portrays him as a violent school bully. Although Bailey admitted picking on Eminem in school, he said he merely \"bumped\" him and gave him a \"little shove\". The lawsuit was dismissed on October 20, 2003; Judge Deborah Servitto, who wrote a portion of her opinion in rap-like rhyming verse, ruled that it was clear to the public that the lyrics were exaggerated.\r\nOn March 31, 2002, French jazz pianist Jacques Loussier filed a $10 million lawsuit against Eminem and Dr. Dre, claimed that the beat for \"Kill You\" was taken from his instrumental \"Pulsion\". Loussier demanded that sales of The Marshall Mathers LP be halted and any remaining copies destroyed. The case was later settled out of court.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Eminem was accused of assaulting Miad Jarbou, a resident of Royal Oak, Michigan, in the bathroom of a Detroit strip club, but was never charged. Two years later, Jarbou sued Eminem for more than $25,000 in damages.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Eminem\'s music-publishing company (Eight Mile Style) and Martin Affiliated sued Apple Inc. and Aftermath Entertainment, claiming that Aftermath was not authorized to negotiate a deal with Apple for digital downloads of 93 Eminem songs on Apple\'s iTunes. The case against Apple was settled shortly after the trial began, in late September 2009.\r\n\r\nIn July 2010, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled in F.B.T. Productions, LLC v. Aftermath Records that F.B.T. Productions and Eminem were owed a royalty of 50 percent of Aftermath\'s net revenue from licensing his recordings to companies such as Apple, Sprint Corporation, Nextel Communications, Cingular and T-Mobile. In March 2011, the Supreme Court of the United States declined to hear the case.\r\n\r\nIn October 2013, Eminem sampled Chicago-based rap group Hotstylz\'s 2008 viral hit, \"Lookin\' Boy\", for his 2013 hit single \"Rap God\". The group claims that Eminem did not receive permission to use the sample, nor did he credit or compensate them. In November 2013, Hotstylz released a diss track towards Eminem titled \"Rap Fraud\", where they sample several of his songs and criticize him for not crediting them. In January 2015, TMZ reported that Hotstylz was suing Eminem and his label, Shady Records, for $8 million, for using the 25-second sample of \"Lookin\' Boy\" on his song \"Rap God\" without their permission.\r\nUnited States Secret Service\r\nOn December 8, 2003, the United States Secret Service reported that it was \"looking into\" allegations that Eminem threatened U.S. President George W. Bush in \"We As Americans\" (an unreleased bootleg at the time), with the lyrics: \"Fuck money, I don\'t rap for dead presidents. I\'d rather see the president dead, it\'s never been said but I set precedents.\" The incident was included in the video for \"Mosh\", as a newspaper clipping on a wall with articles about unfortunate incidents in Bush\'s career. \"We As Americans\" eventually appeared on Encore\'s deluxe-edition bonus disc with altered lyrics.\r\n\r\nIn 2018–2019, the Secret Service interviewed Eminem again regarding threatening lyrics towards President Donald Trump and his daughter Ivanka.\r\nAllegations of homophobia\r\nSome of Eminem\'s lyrics have been criticized for being homophobic, and an Australian politician attempted to ban him from the country. Eminem denies the charge, saying that when he was growing up words such as \"faggot\" and \"queer\" were used generally in a derogatory manner and not specifically toward homosexuals. During a 2010 60 Minutes interview, journalist Anderson Cooper explored the issue:\r\n\r\nCooper: Some of the lyrics, like, you know, in the song \"Criminal\" you say \"My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge, That\'ll stab you in the head, whether you\'re a fag or lez, Or the homosex, hermaph or a trans-a-vest, Pants or dress—hate fags? The answer\'s \'yes\'\".\r\nEminem: Yeah, this scene I came up in. That word was thrown around so much, you know, \"faggot\" was like thrown around constantly to each other, like in battling.\r\nCooper: Do you not like gay people?\r\nEminem: No, I don\'t have any problem with nobody. You know what I mean? I\'m just like whatever.\r\n\r\nEminem was accused yet again of using homophobic words in his lyrics in \"Rap God\" (2013) and explained \"I don\'t know how to say this without saying it how I\'ve said it a million times. But that word, those kind of words, when I came up battle-rappin\' or whatever, I never really equated those words ... (to actually mean homosexual)\".\r\n\r\nEminem is a friend of gay singer Elton John and publicly supports gay rights. When asked in an interview with The New York Times about the subject of same-sex marriage being legalized in his home state of Michigan, Eminem responded, \"I think if two people love each other, then what the hell? I think that everyone should have the chance to be equally miserable, if they want\", explaining that his \"overall look on things is a lot more mature than it used to be.\r\nCanada\r\nOn October 26, 2000, Eminem was scheduled to perform at Toronto\'s SkyDome when Ontario Attorney General Jim Flaherty said that Eminem should not be allowed to enter the country. \"I personally don\'t want anyone coming to Canada who will come here and advocate violence against women\", he said. Flaherty also said that he was \"disgusted\" when he read the lyrics of \"Kill You\", which includes the lines \"Slut, you think I won\'t choke no whore / Till the vocal cords don\'t work in her throat no more?\" Although public reaction to Flaherty\'s position was generally negative, with barring Eminem from the country considered a free-speech issue, Liberal MPP Michael Bryant suggested that hate crime charges should be brought against Eminem for advocating violence against women in his lyrics. Robert Everett-Green wrote in a Globe and Mail editorial, \"Being offensive is Eminem\'s job description\". Eminem\'s Toronto concert went on as planned.\r\n\r\nLegacy:\r\nCredited for popularizing hip hop to a Middle American audience, Eminem\'s unprecedented global commercial success and acclaimed works for a white rapper are widely recognized for breaking racial barriers for the acceptance of white rappers in popular music. Rising from rags to riches, Eminem\'s anger-fueled music represented widespread angst and the reality of the American underclass. He has been greatly influential for artists of various genres. Stephen Hill, the then vice president of African American-themed television network BET (Black Entertainment Television), said in 2002:\r\n\r\nEminem gets a pass in the same vein that back during segregation black folks had to be better than average, had to be the best, to be accepted ... he is better than the best. In his own way, he is the best lyricist, alliterator and enunciator out there in hip-hop music. In terms of rapping about the pain that other disenfranchised people feel, there is no one better at their game than Eminem.\r\n\r\nIn 2002, the BBC said that the perception of Eminem as a \"modern-day William Shakespeare\" was comparable to the reception of American singer Bob Dylan: \"Not since Bob Dylan\'s heyday in the mid-1960s has an artist\'s output been subjected to such intense academic scrutiny as an exercise in contemporary soul-searching. US critics point to [Eminem\'s] vivid portraits of disenfranchised lives – using the stark, direct language of the street – as an accurate reflection of social injustice.\" In addition, the BBC highlighted that \"Where parents once recoiled in horror [to his music], there now seems a greater willingness to acknowledge a music that is striking such a chord among the American young, angry white underclass. Dan Ozzi of Vice highlighted that Eminem during the early 2000s was \"the one artist high school kids seemed to unanimously connect with.... he represented everything high school years are about: blind rage, misguided rebellion, adolescent frustration. He was like a human middle finger. An X-rated Dennis the Menace for a dial-up modem generation.\r\n\r\nWriting for Spin in 2002, rock critic Alan Light compared Eminem to the Beatles\' John Lennon:\r\n\r\nEminem is even starting to bear a resemblance to one of those rock icons ... Marshall Mathers is becoming something like this generation\'s John Lennon ... Lennon and Eminem were both subjects of pickets and protests; they both wrote songs about troubled relationships with their mothers; they both wrote about their strange public lives with their wives; they both wrote about how much they loved their kids. Lennon, of course, was able to find ways to use his voice to advocate for peace rather than just blasting away at litigious family members and various pop stars, but still, few other pop musicians since Lennon have found a way to render their private psychodramas into compelling art as effectively as Eminem.\r\n\r\nRegarding his rehearsal with Eminem for the \"Stan\" duet at the 2001 Grammy Awards, English singer Elton John said, \"[When] Eminem made his entrance, I got goosebumps, the likes of which I have not felt since I first saw Jimi Hendrix, Mick Jagger, James Brown and Aretha Franklin. Eminem was that good. I just thought, \'Fuck, this man is amazing.\' There are very few performers who can grab you like that the first time — only the greats. John further praised Eminem, saying, \"Eminem is a true poet of his time, someone we\'ll be talking about for decades to come. He tells stories in such a powerful and distinctive way. As a lyricist, he\'s one of the best ever. Eminem does for his audience what [Bob] Dylan did for his: He writes how he feels. His anger, vulnerability, and humor come out. Concerning the controversy surrounding Eminem due to his transgressive music, American entertainer Madonna said, \"I like the fact that Eminem is brash and angry and politically incorrect ... He\'s stirring things up, he\'s provoking a discussion, he\'s making people\'s blood boil. He\'s reflecting on what\'s going on in society right now. That is what art is supposed to do. American musician Stevie Wonder also said, \"Rap to me is a modern blues – a statement of how and where people are at ... I think art is a reflection of our society, and people don\'t like to confront the realities in society ... But until we really confront the truth, we are going to have a Tupac or Eminem or Biggie Smalls to remind us about it – and thank God. They force people to look at realities in society.\r\n\r\nThe previously mentioned Bob Dylan praised Eminem, along with other artists, in a 2022 interview with the Wall Street Journal.\r\n\r\nEminem has been credited with boosting the careers of hip-hop proteges such as 50 Cent, Yelawolf, Stat Quo, Royce da 5\'9\", Cashis, Obie Trice, Bobby Creekwater, Boogie, and hip-hop groups such as D12 and Slaughterhouse. A number of artists have cited Eminem as an influence, including The Weeknd, Rae Sremmurd, Logic, Joyner Lucas, Lil Wayne, 50 Cent, Kendrick Lamar, Ed Sheeran, J. Cole, Chance the Rapper, Regina Spektor, Lana Del Rey, and Juice WRLD.\r\n\r\nAchievements and honors:\r\nWith global sales of over 220 million records, Eminem is one of the best-selling music artists ever. He has had thirteen number-one albums on the Billboard 200: nine solo, two with D12 and one with Bad Meets Evil. He was the bestselling music artist from 2000 to 2009 in the US according to Nielsen SoundScan. He was also the bestselling male music artist in the United States in the 2010s.

Known as one of the central pioneers and propagators of the prominent Chicago drill style, he was 16 upon signing a multi-million dollar record contract with Interscope Records. Keef is also the CEO of his own label imprint Glory Boyz Entertainment, later renamed Glo Gang. He released his debut mixtape The Glory Road on July 9, 2011 followed by Bang in October that year. Keef\'s debut album Finally Rich was released in December 2012.\r\n\r\nCozart attended Dulles Elementary School and later Banner High School on Chicago\'s South Side, which is where he got his career start. In December 2011, he was arrested on a weapons charge (aggravated unlawful use of a weapon) and put under house arrest at his grandmother\'s home. While under house arrest, Cozart posted several videos to his YouTube account. The attention he received grew in the short time between the release of several mixtapes and several music videos, including \"Bang,\" \"3Hunna,\" and \"I Don\'t Like.\" After two locally successful mixtapes, \"I Don\'t Like\" became a local hit in Chicago. It also caught fellow Chicago rapper Kanye West\'s attention, and West organized a remix of the song along with rappers Pusha T, Jadakiss, and Big Sean. On July 7, 2012, it was announced that Chief Keef would be performing at the 2012 Lollapalooza music festival.\r\n\r\nIn the following years, Keef has served up a continuous stream of releases, such as Back From the Dead 2 (2014), Bang 3 (2015), and Thot Breaker (2017).

The Alchemist has been an active producer since 1991. He hails from affluent Beverly Hills, California. After rising to prominence in the late 1990s as a close associate of Dilated Peoples, he went on to produce for many of hip-hop\'s leading artists in the 2000s.\r\n\r\nAs a teen, Al began to identify strongly with the rebellious lyrics and urban sounds of hip-hop, and he began writing his own lyrics as a creative outlet. He joined up with other like-minded artists who wrote lyrics and rebelled strongly against their \"uptight\" suburban surroundings, among whom were Shifty Shellshock of Crazy Town, Evidence of Dilated Peoples and Scott Caan, son of James Caan. They would often hang out in urban areas of Los Angeles and participated in typical teenage rebellious activities like partying, smoking marijuana, and general mischief.\r\n\r\nAl and Scott decided to become a duo named The Whooliganz. While rhyming at a party in L.A., they attracted the attention of B-Real of Cypress Hill. He invited the teens to join his crew, The Soul Assassins, which also included the groups House of Pain and Funkdoobiest. In 1993, the Whooliganz released their first single, \"Put Your Handz Up.\" The song received little radio airplay and their record label, Tommy Boy Records, decided to shelve their album. Rejected, Scott focused his creative energy on acting while Al became interested in process of making hip-hop beats.\r\n\r\nDJ Muggs took Al under his wing and taught him how to use a sampler and mixing board. After helping to produce a few tracks for Cypress Hill, Al became the main producer for his childhood friend, Evidence and his group Dilated Peoples. When Dilated debuted in 1998, they were an underground sensation creating a huge buzz about the man behind those incredible beats.\r\n\r\nIn 1999, Muggs introduced Al to his good friends, the popular hip-hop group Mobb Deep. Al produced two songs for their Murda Muzik album. Impressed by his production skills and street smarts, Mobb Deep took him under their wing, using his beats on all their subsequent albums. As Alchemist\'s profile increased, he went on to produce for many of hip hop\'s most successful and prominent artists, such as Nas, Fat Joe, Jadakiss, Ghostface Killah and Snoop Dogg. He has also remixed songs for bands and artists in other genres such as Linkin Park and Morcheeba. Al stayed loyal to his old friends, continuing to produce for Dilated, Cypress Hill, Everlast (formerly of House of Pain) and Crazy Town. He also enjoys producing for lesser-known underground rappers, often giving them some of his best beats. In 2004, 11 years after his rapping career folded, The Alchemist returned with his long-awaited debut album, \"1st Infantry.\" The album yielded the hit single \"Hold You Down\" (featuring Prodigy, Illa Ghee, and Nina Sky), which hit number ninety-five on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2005.\r\n\r\nAlchemist was the official tour DJ for Eminem on his 2005 Anger Management 3 Tour, replacing the recently-ousted DJ Green Lantern. However on July 13, 2005, the tour bus carrying Eminem\'s entourage (including rapper Stat Quo as well as Alchemist) swerved off the road and turned over. Alchemist was treated for broken ribs and a collapsed lung.\r\n\r\nThe Alchemist is one of the music producers behind the video game Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars released by Rockstar Games. He was also on Tim Westwood TV, when Eminem, Royce Da 5\'9\" and Mr. Porter freestyled. During an interview with Worldwide Conspiracy Radio, The Alchemist revealed he would be dropping a 2-part project with fellow West Coast producer Oh No entitled Gangrene, the first to be released in July, the second in November, both on Decon. Alchemist was also the DJ for the Eminem set on the BBC1 chat-show Jonathan Ross on June 4, 2010.\r\n\r\nAlchemist is Eminem\'s official DJ, since DJ Green Lantern departed from Shady Records in 2005 because of a dispute related to the feud of 50 Cent and Jadakiss. In 2006, Eminem released a collaboration album with Shady Records called Eminem Presents: The Re-Up. Since the Alchemist is his official DJ, he produced some of the tracks on the mixtape, as well as compiling the album in a mixtape fashion. On December 18, 2013, he was named the runner-up for Producer of the Year by HipHopDX. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Alchemist\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Genasis, and others.\r\n\r\nBorn Adolph Thornton, Jr. in Chicago, Dolph debuted in 2008 with the mixtape  Paper Route Campaign. Subsequent releases like The Weed Album and South Memphis Kingpin brought him to 2012, when he dropped the first in a successful series of mixtapes dubbed High Class Street Music . By the time High Class Street Music 4  and the  Preach single dropped in 2014, Dolph was working with major-label producers including Drumma Boy and Zaytoven. Both provided tracks for his 2016 debut LP, King of Memphis, which featured no guest artists, and debuted at number 49 on the Billboard 200 albums chart.\r\n\r\nA trio of mixtapes followed, ending withm Rich Crack Baby.

Another mixtape, Gelato, followed in early 2017, containing the Yo Gotti diss track Play wit Yo\' Bitch as well as tracks featuring Migos, Wiz Khalifa, and Lil Yachty. Dolph\'s second studio album,Bulletproof, was released in April of 2017 and reached the Top 40 of the Billboard 200.

One year later, Dolph joined frequent collaborator Key Glock for 2019\'s Dum and Dummer, the pair\'s first collaborative mixtape. Dolph\'s seventh studio album, Rich Slave, arrived in August 2020 and found him addressing issues of racism and inequality in America. Included on the album were guest appearances by Megan Thee Stallion, Key Glock, and G Herbo. In 2021, Dolph and Glock reunited for Dum and Dummer 2, followed promptly by PAPER ROUTE iLLUMINATi, a showcase album for Dolph\'s Paper Route Empire label.

He was also a noted record producer under the pseudonym Larry Fisherman. Raised Jewish and teaching himself music from a young age, McCormick defied the stereotypes of hip-hop and released his first mixtape under the name EZ Mac, titled \"But My Mackin\' Ain\'t Easy\" in 2007, when McCormick was only fifteen. He released many more in his lifetime, including \"K.I.D.S.\" in 2010, which earned Mac widespread attention in the hip-hop scene, and \"Best Day Ever\" in 2011, which featured the hit single \"Donald Trump\". \r\n\r\nHe was signed to Pittsburgh-based Rostrum Records and released his debut album Blue Slide Park on November 8, 2011, which debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200 despite being released completely independently. He released five studio albums in his lifetime, which all peaked in the top 5, along with a posthumous album titled \"Circles\" with help from producer Jon Brion and Miller\'s family.\r\n\r\nIn 2013, Miller released his second studio album, \"Watching Movies With the Sound Off\". The album featured artists such as Earl Sweatshirt, Tyler, The Creator, Ab-Soul, and long-time friend ScHoolboy Q. The album took a more personal approach compared to his previous works.\r\n\r\nIn 2014, Miller released the 24-track mixtape \"Faces\". Considered by many to be one of his best works, he explores themes of drug use, employing and featuring collaborators of Mac from his previous album, including ScHoolboy Q and Earl Sweatshirt, but also sees new faces such as Rick Ross. \r\n\r\nIn 2015, Mac released his third studio album, \"GO:OD AM\", his first with new label Warner Records. The album featured a more energetic and vibrant theme than \"Faces\" and \"Watching Movies With the Sound Off\", reflecting a more optimistic,  redemptive angle on his personal life, while maintaining elements of his introspective and thought-provoking style from earlier works.\r\n\r\nIn 2016, Miller released his fourth studio album, titled \"The Divine Feminine\". He explores themes of love and femininity, largely influenced by his relationship with Ariana Grande at the time and featuring appearances from the likes of Kendrick Lamar and Anderson Paak. \r\n\r\nIn August 2018, following major events in Miller\'s life, including his breakup with Ariana Grande, with Miller\'s drug addiction alleged to be a contributing factor, as well as a car crash incident in which McCormick was charged with a DUI, Miller released his fifth and final studio album during his lifetime titled \"Swimming\". Continuing the dive into his personal life, Miller explores his heartfelt struggles and grief in the past, but remains optimistic for the future. Swimming was nominated for Best Rap Album posthumously at the 2019 Grammy Awards.\r\n\r\nMiller had struggled with substance abuse for a long time before his death. On September 7, 2018, he was found dead in his home in Los Angeles, California from an accidental overdose of fentanyl, cocaine, and alcohol, only a little over a month after the release of \"Swimming\".  He was only 26 years old. McCormick was buried in his hometown of Pittsburgh. Miller\'s passing was largely unexpected and had a large impact on the hip-hop community as a whole, with many paying their respects to Miller.  On October 31, 2018, a tribute concert, titled \"Mac Miller: A Celebration of Life\", featured renowned artists and many longtime collaborators of Miller including Travis Scott, ScHoolboy Q, SZA, Chance the Rapper, and Earl Sweatshirt. The concert was a celebration of the late rapper\'s life and musical achievements, and all profits were donated to the Mac Miller Circles Fund, which provides young people from underprivileged backgrounds with opportunities to explore arts and music.\r\n\r\n In January 2020, Miller\'s posthumous album titled \"Circles\", worked on in companionship with his album \"Swimming\", was announced on January 8 along with the single \"Good News\" and released later that month. Every track on the album was accompanied by a video of the same name, often with psychedelic imagery and images of Mac before his passing and throughout his life. With a more melancholic theme compared to his previous works, the album was well-received by fans and critics alike, renowned for the care placed in continuing Mac\'s artistic vision.\r\n\r\nAnd, he did it all without a Drake feature. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Mac+Miller\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

He is widely considered to be one of the greatest hip-hop artists of all time.\r\n\r\nWallace was born and raised in the Brooklyn borough of New York City. His debut album Ready to Die (1994) made him a central figure in East Coast hip hop and increased New York City\'s visibility in the genre at a time when West Coast hip hop dominated the mainstream. The following year, he led Junior M.A.F.I.A.—a protégé group composed of his childhood friends—to chart success. In 1996, while recording his second album, Wallace was heavily involved in the growing East Coast–West Coast hip hop feud. On March 9, 1997, he was murdered by an unknown assailant in a drive-by shooting in Los Angeles. His second album, Life After Death (1997), released two weeks later, rose to No. 1 on the U.S. album charts. In 2000, it became one of the few hip-hop albums to be certified Diamond.\r\n\r\nWallace was noted for his \"loose, easy flow\"; dark, semi-autobiographical lyrics; and storytelling abilities, which focused on crime and hardship. Three more albums have been released since his death, and he has certified sales of over 17 million records in the United States, including 13.4 million albums.\r\n\r\nWallace was born at St. Mary\'s Hospital in the Brooklyn borough of New York City on May 21, 1972, the only child of Jamaican immigrant parents. His mother, Voletta Wallace, was a preschool teacher, while his father, Selwyn George Latore, was a welder and politician. His father left the family when Wallace was two years old, and his mother worked two jobs while raising him. Wallace grew up at 226 St. James Place in Brooklyn\'s Clinton Hill, near the border with Bedford-Stuyvesant. Wallace excelled at Queen of All Saints Middle School winning several awards as an English student. He was nicknamed \"Big\" because he was overweight by the age of 10. Wallace said he started dealing drugs when he was around the age of 12. His mother, often away at work, did not know of his drug dealing until he was an adult. He began rapping as a teenager, entertaining people on the streets, and performed with local groups the Old Gold Brothers and the Techniques. At his request, Wallace transferred from Bishop Loughlin Memorial High School to George Westinghouse Career and Technical Education High School, where future rappers DMX, Jay-Z, and Busta Rhymes were also attending. According to his mother, Wallace was still a good student but developed a \"smart-ass\" attitude at the new school. At age 17, Wallace dropped out of school and became more involved in crime. In 1989, he was arrested on weapons charges in Brooklyn and sentenced to five years\' probation. In 1990, he was arrested on a violation of his probation. A year later, Wallace was arrested in North Carolina for dealing crack cocaine. He spent nine months in jail before making bail.\r\n\r\nWallace\'s lyrical topics and themes included mafioso tales (\"Niggas Bleed\"), his drug-dealing past (\"10 Crack Commandments\"), materialistic bragging (\"Hypnotize\"), as well as humor (\"Just Playing (Dreams)\"), and romance (\"Me & My Bitch\"). Rolling Stone named Wallace in 2004 as \"one of the few young male songwriters in any pop style writing credible love songs\".\r\n\r\nGuerilla Black, in the book How to Rap, describes how Wallace was able to both \"glorify the upper echelon\" and \"[make] you feel his struggle\". According to Touré of The New York Times in 1994, Wallace\'s lyrics \" autobiographical details about crime and violence with emotional honesty\". Marriott of The New York Times (in 1997) believed his lyrics were not strictly autobiographical and wrote he \"had a knack for exaggeration that increased sales\". Wallace described his debut as \"a big pie, with each slice indicating a different point in my life involving bitches and niggaz... from the beginning to the end\".\r\n\r\nReady to Die is described by Rolling Stone as a contrast of \"bleak\" street visions and being \"full of high-spirited fun, bringing the pleasure principle back to hip-hop\". AllMusic write of \"a sense of doom\" in some of his songs and the NY Times note some being \"laced with paranoia\"; Wallace described himself as feeling \"broke and depressed\" when he made his debut. The final song on the album, \"Suicidal Thoughts\", featured Wallace contemplating suicide and concluded with him committing the act.\r\n\r\nOn Life After Death, Wallace\'s lyrics went \"deeper\". Krims explains how upbeat, dance-oriented tracks (which featured less heavily on his debut) alternate with \"reality rap\" songs on the record and suggests that he was \"going pimp\" through some of the lyrical topics of the former. XXL magazine wrote that Wallace \"revamped his image\" through the portrayal of himself between the albums, going from \"midlevel hustler\" on his debut to \"drug lord\".\r\n\r\nAllMusic wrote that the success of Ready to Die is \"mostly due to Wallace\'s skill as a storyteller\"; in 1994, Rolling Stone described Wallace\'s ability in this technique as painting \"a sonic picture so vibrant that you\'re transported right to the scene\". On Life After Death, Wallace notably demonstrated this skill on \"I Got a Story to Tell\", creating a story as a rap for the first half of the song and then retelling the same story \"for his boys\" in conversation form.\r\n\r\nConsidered one of the best rappers of all time, Wallace was described by AllMusic as \"the savior of East Coast hip-hop\". The Source magazine named Wallace the greatest rapper of all time in its 150th issue in 2002. In 2003, when XXL magazine asked several hip hop artists to list their five favorite MCs, Wallace\'s name appeared on more rappers\' lists than anyone else. In 2006, MTV ranked him at No. 3 on their list of The Greatest MCs of All Time, calling him possibly \"the most skillful ever on the mic\". Editors of About.com ranked him No. 3 on their list of the Top 50 MCs of Our Time (1987–2007). In 2012, The Source ranked him No. 3 on their list of the Top 50 Lyrical Leaders of all time. Rolling Stone has referred to him as the \"greatest rapper that ever lived\". In 2015, Billboard named Wallace as the greatest rapper of all time.\r\n\r\nSince his death, Wallace\'s lyrics have been sampled and quoted by a variety of hip hop, R&B and pop artists including Jay-Z, 50 Cent, Alicia Keys, Fat Joe, Nelly, Ja Rule, Eminem, Lil Wayne, Game, Clinton Sparks, Michael Jackson and Usher. On August 28, 2005, at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards, Sean Combs (then using the rap alias \"P. Diddy\") and Snoop Dogg paid tribute to Wallace: an orchestra played while the vocals from \"Juicy\" and \"Warning\" played on the arena speakers. In September 2005, VH1 held its second annual \"Hip Hop Honors\", with a tribute to Wallace headlining the show.\r\n\r\nWallace had begun to promote a clothing line called Brooklyn Mint, which was to produce plus-sized clothing but fell dormant after he died. In 2004, his managers, Mark Pitts and Wayne Barrow, launched the clothing line, with help from Jay-Z, selling T-shirts with images of Wallace on them. A portion of the proceeds go to the Christopher Wallace Foundation and to Jay-Z\'s Shawn Carter Scholarship Foundation. In 2005, Voletta Wallace hired branding and licensing agency Wicked Cow Entertainment to guide the estate\'s licensing efforts. Wallace-branded products on the market include action figures, blankets, and cell phone content.\r\n\r\nThe Christopher Wallace Memorial Foundation holds an annual black-tie dinner (\"B.I.G. Night Out\") to raise funds for children\'s school equipment and to honor Wallace\'s memory. For this particular event, because it is a children\'s schools\' charity, \"B.I.G.\" is also said to stand for \"Books Instead of Guns\".\r\n\r\nThere is a large portrait mural of Wallace as Mao Zedong on Fulton Street in Brooklyn a half-mile west from Wallace\'s old block. A fan petitioned to have the corner of Fulton Street and St. James Place, near Wallace\'s childhood home renamed in his honor, garnering support from local businesses and attracting more than 560 signatures.\r\n\r\nA large portrait of Wallace features prominently in the Netflix series Luke Cage, due to the fact that he served as muse for the creation of the Marvel Cinematic Universe\'s version of Marvel Comics character Cornell \"Cottonmouth\" Stokes. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Notorious+B.I.G.\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

A childhood fascination with electronic duo  Daft Punk\'s seminal album Discovery and the musical Cats gave him a keen awareness of the importance of visual presentation. As a teen, he taught himself the drums and started a heavy metal band, playing and writing songs by ear. He was later drawn to b-boying and breakdancing as a form of physical self-expression, skipping class to busk in downtown Sydney and documenting his freestyles on Youtube.\r\nHis channel gave him an audience, and it even connected him with his future DPR collaborator and friend Hong Da-Bin (also known as DPR LIVE). After graduating from his performing arts school in 2008, he bought an one-way ticket to Seoul to pursue his dreams as a dancer. He debuted as the leader and rapper of K-Pop group C-Clown in 2012, performing as Rome.\r\nHis experience as an Idol was short lived and tumultuous - the unit disbanded in 2015 -but it did give him a better understanding of the industry.

YNW Melly is also co-founder of rap collective, YNW. His music often draws from his lived experiences, evidenced by his 2017 incarceration for weapons charges. Upon release, he began to gain popularity from his track “Murder On My Mind.” which he wrote while in jail. After the release of the track, he was once again arrested as the song violated his probation, and sent him back to prison.\r\n\r\nMelly’s career initially started to take off in 2018 when singles such as “Virtual (Blue Balenciagas)”, “Butter Pecan”, and “772 Love” had begun to gain popularity alongside “Murder on My Mind.”\r\n\r\nOn August 3, 2018, Melly released his debut mixtape I AM YOU which included his popular single, “Murder on My Mind”. It also included a sequel to the song called “Mind on My Murder”.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the studio with companions YNW Bortlen, YNW SakChaser, and YNW Juvy, on the night of October 26, 2018, Melly and his friends had been caught in a drive-by-shooting where SakChaser and Juvy were murdered. Melly and Bortlen were the only survivors of the attack.\r\n\r\nWhile working on his sophomore mixtape, after the death of his friends, Melly had gained more attention and began to obtain cosigns from several rappers such as Young Thug, Trippie Redd, and Kodak Black. However, on January 3, 2019, Melly was arrested for possession of marijuana.\r\n\r\nOn January 18, 2019, while incarcerated, Melly released his sophomore mixtape We All Shine, which included one of his most influential cosign’s, Kanye West who was a feature on the song “Mixed Personalities.”.\r\n\r\nMelly was released from jail on January 25, 2019, and released “Gang”, the first day out single that had taken off after the hype around “Mixed Personalities.”\r\n\r\nAfter being released for only a month, on February 13, 2019, Melly turned himself in after a warrant was put out for him and Bortlen connecting to the murders of YNW Sakchaser and YNW Juvy. YNW Melly posted this to his Instagram on February 13:\r\n\r\nTo all my fans and supporters no I did not get locked up in Washington , but I am turning myself in today I want you guys to know I love you and appreciate every single one of y\'all, a couple months ago I lost my two brothers by violence and now the system want to find justice.. unfortunately a lot of rumors and lies are being said but no worries god is with me and my brother @ynw.bortlen and we want y\'all to remember it’s a ynw Family I love you @ynwsakchaser1 and @ynwjuvy #freeus\r\n\r\nPrior to his incarceration, songs such as “Murder on My Mind” and “Mind on My Murder” had gained traction making their way in the Billboard Hot 100 and gaining RIAA certifications in a matter of months. Speculations made people believe that the songs were related to the murders, however, they were soon put to rest due to the time of the recordings being almost two years prior to the shootings.\r\n\r\nAfter spending months incarcerated, on November 22, 2019, he released his debut studio album, Melly vs. Melvin featuring his 9lokkNine-assisted “223’s”.\r\n\r\nAfter the rise of COVID-19 disease in 2020, on April 3, Melly had tested positive for the virus while awaiting trial. After being infected, Melly’s lawyers tried to play this to his advantage and requested a medical release as conditions can worsen in the jail environment. Melly was denied release on April 17 and conditions have been said to worsen since.\r\n\r\nAfter the release of fellow Floridian rapper Kodak Black, Melly’s team had taken advantage and released “Thugged Out” to keep Melly’s name alive in the industry. They carried on releasing singles throughout the year with artists such as Queen Naija and Hotboii.\r\n\r\nAgain, while still awaiting trial, on August 13, 2021, he released his sophomore studio album, Just A Matter of Slime, featuring his highly anticipated Lil Uzi Vert-assisted “Mind of Melvin”.\r\n\r\nAfter prosecutors had claimed they had a confession of Melly admitting to the murders, on November 1, Melly’s lawyers came out and denied the claims and said that Melly was just rapping a song titled “4:30 AM” by Kevin Gates. Soon after, on November 30, Melly’s trial had been set for March 7, 2022. - TippleTripple123 <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/YNW+Melly\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Well according to The Guardian, he is an artist unlike no other. He is not like anyone else and he isn\'t bound to  the gilded cage of privilege inhabited by Jay-Z and Kanye West,  instead he depicts everyday rural poverty with the evocative precision of a master storyteller. His style is unlike anything your average rap fan has ever seen, ranging from American gothic to gore, the \"richness and invention of his language\" and range of his vocal style \"from beer-swilling rowdiness to a crawling, contemptuous sibilance\". He has said that he feels he represents \"not the ideal American\" but those Americans that he calls the core: The Slums. \r\n\r\nMichael Wayne Atha (born December 30, 1979), primarily known by his stage name(s) Yelawolf,  Catfish Billy, as well as for a short period of time, M.W.A., is a rapper, singer, songwriter, entrepreneur, producer, and quite the storied and well traveled individual. Initially signed to Shady Records, Ghet-O-Vision Entertainment and Interscope Records in 2010 after a run of mildly successful independent releases, since 2019 he now operates his own label as well as brand under the  \"Slumerican\" name. Under Shady Records Yelawolf was co-managed by Redd Klay Entertainment along with his personal manager Jeremy \"J Dot\" Jones. Currently, Yelawolf is currently managed by Edward Crowe.\r\n\r\nAtha was born in Gadsden, Alabama, to a 15 year old mother and an absent father, and mostly raised in Antioch, Tennessee (but he lived in many places besides these two). Yelawolf did not have the easiest childhood. However, from a young  age, Atha had a large interest in music and had been exposed to many different genres. This was in large part due to his mother, Sheila\'s, boyfriend being a sound engineer for Aerosmith around the time that the Run-DMC version of \"Walk This Way\" was released. This resulted in a young Atha making friends with the trio. Yelawolf has recalled that Run-DMC once visited him at his childhood home, and gifted him some Beastie Boys\' \"Licensed to Ill\" cassette tapes. As previously mentioned, Wolf spent much of his time in Antioch, Tennessee, as he was raised there. While there he  attended Carter Lawrence Middle School in Nashville, which is located near the Edgehill Homes apartment projects, which had a vibrant Hip-Hop/Rap scene. Atha has said that while attending Carter Lawrence is when the genre of Hip-Hop/Rap all began to make sense to him. Yelawolf lists  Three 6 Mafia, J Dilla, Pete Rock, CL Smooth, Black Star, Hieroglyphics, the Brooklyn-based trio Digable Planets as some of his inspirations, with Outkast being his biggest, and this can be accredited to his time in the projects and Carter Lawrence. Pushed by his idols he had disc, Atha started writing raps and \"performing\" them in the 5th grade, but mostly just with his friends, while skating, in the car, or while at a skate spot. Furthermore, even though he is from the South, Yela has said his favorite sound he was once enamoured with was the East Coast sound. As previously mentioned, Wolf was exposed to many genres as a young man, and due to his home in the same state that holds Music City, he was taught to embrace his country roots through artists such as Johnny Cash, and bands such as Lynyrd Skynyrd. Finally, Atha also lists Kid Rock, Eminem, Black Sabbath, Kraftwerk, The Doors, Fleetwood Mac, Metallica, Portishead, and N.W.A as some of his many inspirations that led to his unique sound. \r\n\r\nFollowing his childhood, for a brief period of time at the ages of either 18 or 19, Atha moved to Berkeley, California , with his friend, Will Loach, to pursue skateboarding. In his childhood years, Atha was a great skater, and considered himself to be completely comfortable on a skateboard, even knowing many, many tricks including flip tricks and grind tricks. Sadly however, when Yela arrived in California it became clear to him that he would not make it as a pro-skater, because even though he was good, he was being shown up by the other skaters around him. Plus in addition, Atha was constantly putting his body through hell with the wear and tear from being a Skate-Rat. Also, he was not happy with the way of living in California, as he had been eating horribly, and practically living in abandoned frat houses. It was at this point that Atha realized he wanted to change his life for the better. What broke him  was the fact that many nights he was homeless while in California, which led him to tell his mom to buy him a plane ticket for Christmas so he could come home. But, the hard times didn\'t stop for Yelawolf when he got home to Alabama. \r\n\r\nWhen he returned to Alabama, Wolf knew nobody, and he figured if he stayed there he would remain a bum. He had to make another decision to change his life. In 2001, for one fishing season, Atha had an idea he told one of his friends: \"Yo, let\'s go get on a fishing boat in Alaska and make some money\"  he said, being well aware of the risks, and the high possibility of death on an Alaskan fishing boat, Wolf threw caution to the wind and decided to pursue fishing. He hopped on a Greyhound bus and did a 5 day trip across the country to make this happen. This did not work out in his favor. In simple terms, he got screwed over. He didn\'t get paid anything near the promised amount, and his captain was very incompetent. After working for 20 hours per day, for 7 days a week, Atha only took $1500 home after a month. Following this, Atha once again returned home, and he began to dabble in both illegal and legal hustles. Wolf worked at just about every job he could, including construction, but never waiting tables. He has made it very clear he would have never done that. His illegal hustle was dealing drugs, which he has been very open about, and he has also been open about the fact that he wasn\'t good at it, because he just smoked them all by himself, as well as being \"too nice\" and \"giving people too much weight for too cheap.\" All this time, Yela still wanted to pursue rapping. In 2005, a small fire was lit under him, that eventually started to be fanned.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Yelawolf appeared on the UPN Network reality series, \"The Road to Stardom\" with Missy Elliott. This was the spark that lit the fire, and following his elimination from the show, Wolf released his debut studio album, \"Creek Water\" (2005). That same year he released \"Pissin\' in a Barrel of Beez\" [Gangsta Grillz]  (2005), a collaborative mixtape with DJ Drama, DJ Jaycee, and DJ Don Cannon. These projects continued to fan the flame that has been lit under Atha following his appearance on Missy Elliott\'s show, This led to Wolf signing with Columbia records in 2006, and this is when he met his [now former] manager in Huntsville, Alabama, Jeremy \"J Dot\" Jones. Shortly after, he moved to Atlanta, and started doing shows, and that is where he met his other [now former] manager, Brother Bear. This began to look like it could be Yela\'s big break. Like he could finally make it and be a rapper. In 2007, he released a single for his upcoming album, \"Fear & Loathing in Small-Town U.S.A.\", titled \"Kickin\'\". Unfortunately, with new management, Columbia records were cutting a ton of artists, and Wolf\'s neck was one of the first on the chopping block. He had been dropped by Columbia, and now \"Fear & Loathing in Small-Town U.S.A.\" had been cancelled. What had looked so promising began to look rather impossible yet again.\r\n\r\nAfter being dropped from Columbia, Yelawolf went on to release two mixtapes, \"Ball of Flames: The Ballad of Slick Rick E. Bobby\" [Reference to Talladega Nights, starring Will Ferrell  and John C. Riley] in 2007, as well as work now considered classic by fans with \"Stereo: A Hip Hop Tribute to Classic Rock\" in 2008. These projects went almost completely unnoticed, and at this point it looked as if the flame that was once being fanned beneath Atha had water poured on it. Then along came Ghet-O-Vision Entertainment in 2009, and following Atha\'s signing to them, he released his debut extended play \"Arena Rap\", which featured samples from a few classic songs, similarly to \"Stereo\". In 2009, after signing with Ghet-O-Vision, Atha began to work with their producer, WLPWR, on his 2009 mixtape titled \"Trunk Muzik.\" \"Trunk Muzik\" was released in 2010, and in that moment, Yelawolf had won. \"Trunk Muzik\" was his breakthrough mixtape, and garnered him a following online, which got him recognized by Interscope Records. Following signing to Interscope in 2010, Yelawolf and his new team began creating a more defined rework/deluxe edition of \"Trunk Muzik\", this time being titled \"Trunk Muzik 0-60\" which was released in November of that same year under both Interscope and Ghet-0-Vision. At this time, this was by far, and considered by the majority to be Wolf\'s best work.\r\n\r\nIn 2011 a rumor began to swirl that  a joint record deal with Eminem was in the works, and these rumors were confirmed true with the release of the 2011 XXL March Issue with Eminem and fellow new Shady Records signees Slaughterhouse. This signing to Shady records was massive. Yelawolf was also featured among the XXL\'s Top 11 Freshmen of 2011, releasing several songs on the magazine\'s yearly Freshman mixtape, along with great company like Kendrick Lamar, Cyhi Da Prynce and Big K.R.I.T.. In April of 2011, Wolf announced \"Radioactive\", his debut album on Shady Records. The title, \"Radioactive\" explains the whole purpose of this album, which was to get Yela active, on the radio. This is evident through the feature list, which was full of big names such as  Kid Rock, Lil Jon, Fefe Dobson, Mystikal, Shawty Fatt, Rittz, Killer Mike, and Gangsta Boo. The album was slated for release in September of 2011, but was pushed back to being released in November of 2011. The album achieved some degree of the mainstream success that Wolf was going for, debuting  #13 on the Billboard 200 albums chart. Even though this was a very commercially successful project, Yelawolf has said he felt he lost a lot of creative liberties with this project and it wasn\'t really him, and many fans have the same consensus. Around this time Yelawolf began a mild beef with Cleveland, Ohio, rapper Machine Gun Kelly, which would go on for many years although never being very intense. \r\n\r\n2012 was a similar situation for Yelawolf. On January 24, 2012, Yelawolf released a track with British singer Ed Sheeran, who was gaining popularity at the time, titled \"You Don\'t Know (For F**k\'s Sake)\". The track was for an upcoming collaborative extended play EP, titled \"The Slumdon Bridge\" . The EP was  released on Valentine\'s Day, 2012 as a free download. In March 2012, Yelawolf announced that recording sessions for his third studio album began in June 2012, and this album would be titled \"Love Story.\" However, due to a stage diving accident which caused a ruptured spleen, Yelawolf decided to delay the album\'s recording process. In addition, Atha revealed that a sequel to \"Trunk Muzik\", titled \"Trunk Muzik Returns\" was in the works. Later that same year, Yelawolf got a little closer back to his roots because in June he released a song titled \"Happy Father\'s Day\", which was the lead single off of his fifth official mixtape, \"Heart of Dixie\", which was to be produced by Alabama producer M16. Then to return closer to his traditional \"representing the people that are the core of America\" sound, he announced a long awaited collaborative EP with the drummer from the once massively popular punk band, Blink-182; Travis Barker. The EP was to be titled \"Psycho White\" and it was going to feature many different experimental sounds, and that it did. The lead single off of \"Psycho White\" featured Skinhead Rob of Transplants and Tim Armstrong of Rancid, and was titled \"Push \'Em\". This song, similarly to \"Growing Up In The Gutter\" (ft. Rittz) [\"Radioactive\"], was a song designed to be extremely brash, in your face, loud, and start a mosh-pit. Alas, as most Yelawolf fans have become accustomed to by now, there were several push-backs. The EP was finally released in November of 2012, debuting at #24 on the Billboard 200 albums chart, with first week sales of 15,000 units. Yelawolf stated that all the tracks on the album will have a music video which is a promise held mostly true, but regarding something that was not held true, during an article with Rolling Stone, both he and Barker hinted at a sequel to the EP, which many fans are still waiting on. Finally for 2012, Yelawolf was a hidden feature on the song \"Pretty Little Girl\" on Blink-182\'s \"Dogs Eating Dogs\" EP. \r\n\r\nWhen 2013 rolled around and neither \"Trunk Muzik Returns\" or \"Love Story\" had been released, fans became worried and questioned what the status of those projects was seeing as how they seemed to be just left up in the air. In an interview he addressed these concerns and said that \"Trunk Muzik Returns\" would be released in February 2013, and that \"Love Story\" would take some time as it would be very different sonically than \"Radioactive\" because as previously mentioned, he felt like he lost a lot of creative power on that project. The plan regarding \"Love Story\" was that he would record the album in Nashville and go to Detroit so he and Eminem could finish the production side of things. \"Trunk Muzik Returns\" was inevitably released slightly late in March of 2013 and it was ten original tracks, some of which featured legendary artists, Raekwon, Paul Wall, Killer Mike, ASAP Rocky, while all being produced by WLPWR. Later that same year, Atha announced in October that on Halloween, \"Black Fall\", his surprise 5 song collaborative EP with DJ Paul of Three 6 Mafia fame would be released. This project took fans back to Yela\'s \"Stereo\" days because some of the songs sampled bands such as Korn, Metallica, and Pink Floyd. This was all for 2013, but then 2014 came around.\r\n\r\nIn 2014 Wolf kick-started the \"Love Story\" hype into full gear when he premiered his debut single from \"Love Story\" titled \"Box Chevy V\", the fifth installment to his famed and popular Box Chevy Series, on Shade 45 during an interview. Yelawolf stated Love Story would be released in May 2014, but this was completely inaccurate as delays pushed \"Love Story\" all the way back to April of 2015. During this time however, Wolf continued promoting the album, and this was by releasing weekly freestyles that sampled rock \'n roll classics, such as  Pink Floyd\'s song, \"Money\". Atha as well as his fans described and consider the freestyles as a \"mini-sequel\" to \"Stereo\". When \"Love Story\" was finally released it was widely agreed upon by fans that it was Yela\'s best album, but critics put it down due to the polarizing fusion of country music and rap music. In spite of this, the album debuted #3 on the Billboard 200 albums chart, with 61,000 copies sold in its first week. Eminem is the only featured guest on Love Story and also serves as an executive producer alongside Yelawolf.\r\n\r\nOn August 25, 2015, Yelawolf was mired in controversy when he decided to defend the Confederate flag. This led to Eminem beginning to distance himself from Wolf, which would eventually be a reason for the parting of Atha from Shady Records. \r\n\r\nThen came one of the darker chapters in both Yelawolf, and United States history. The Charleston Church Shooting. In this event, a white supremacist, who was also an avid Yelawolf fan, walked into an African-American church an began opening fire. The man behind the attack, Dylann Roof, killed nine people that day, in brutal and horrible ways. Roof was convicted of 33 federal hate crime and murder charges, and sentenced to death for this horrible crime. \r\n\r\nNow, out of respect for those who were killed and the families of those that were killed, we won\'t stay on this topic long. This event made Yela reconsider his stance on the Confederate flag, and denouncing it as a symbol of hate, and stating that \"any proud southerner is sad\". The track is over 8 minutes long, and it is meant as an apology, and to spread awareness.\r\n\r\nAfter the controversy had settled, when September of 2015 rolled around, Yelawolf announced his fourth studio album, \"Trial by Fire\". This album was supposed to be, according to Atha, much, much darker than \"Love Story\". This album was going to be produced by Yelawolf, Bones Owens, and Klever, so none of his regular producers. Then he went silent and then in the later months of 2016 Yelawolf was spotted working with the Florida Based producer, Jim Jonsin. Even though they had been spotted, the project they were working on remained a secret. Then, in early October 2016, the surprise collaborative EP, \"House Of The Endless Life\", shortened to just simply \"HOTEL\" was released. This project is regarded as some of Atha\'s best work, however it is not available on any streaming services due to the use of unapproved samples. Following this, the first two singles from \"Trial by Fire\", \"Daylight\" and \"Shadows\" featuring country singer Joshua Headley were released in late 2016 as a means to support the \"Trial By Fire\" tour. However this tour would be short lived. \r\n\r\nAround this time Yelawolf had lost his long term friend, Shawtty Fatt, and his drinking had become a horrible addiction. And this was causing a lot of internal stress that was just waiting for a time to boil over, and boil over it did. During a show in Oregon, Yelawolf was seen destroying equipment belonging to Bones Owens, and not just one or two things, but many, many items. This led to a fallout between Bones, Klever, and Yelawolf which resulted in Bones Owens and Klever leaving the tour and the band. This incident was then followed by an aggressive altercation with a fan at the Sacramento show, which led to Yelawolf abruptly cancelling the remaining seven shows of the \"Trial By Fire\" tour. This was a very dark time for Yelawolf. Following the cancellation of the tour Yelawolf had a mental breakdown and contemplated killing himself before he was admitted to a mental ward where he was slapped with a 51/50 charge. After his release from the mental ward, Atha announced that he would be changing his stage name from Yelawolf which was based on his Cherokee Native American roots, in favor of his birth name, M.W.A. (Michael Wayne Atha), and that he would now sober up. This mental breakdown had many fans extremely worried, and not about the music, but about the man they idolize. At the same time though, many people wondered what the status between Atha and Shady Records was, and what the status of \"Trial By Fire\" was. After his release from the mental ward Atha had pretty much disappeared from the internet for a little over half a year. He had also broken up with his long time fiance, Canadian singer, Fefe Dobson.  \r\n\r\nThen, in a shocking resurgence, in June of 2017, Atha announced \"Row Your Boat\", which would be his return to the Hip-Hop/Rap world, and would be the third single off of \"Trial By Fire\". This received hope for everyone that \"Trial By Fire\" would actually be released and Yelawolf was back, because he actually used the name \'Yelawolf\' for his latest single. And, in more shocking news, Wolf announced another tour, the \"51/50\" tour. The name of the tour references 51/50 which is the term police use to label someone who is mentally ill and a danger to themselves or others around them. This tour would include new dates but also include shows at the previous venues that he had skipped on the \"Trial By Fire\"  following his breakdown, and people who had previously purchased tickets would now get into those venues for free. At this time Yelawolf also announced another installment to his \"Trunk Muzik\" series, and that unlike the first few installments that were mixtapes, this would be a studio album, his fifth under Shady Records. Then finally, after many delays, \"Trial by Fire\" was finally released in October 2017, and it absolutely delivered on his promise of  a much darker, grittier album, especially on songs like \"Sabrina\" and \"Punk\" (ft. DJ Klever, Juicy J, & Travis Barker), as well as a heartfelt tribute to his passed on friend Shawtty Fatt on the song \"Ride or Die\". At this time he reunited with Fefe. It was clear that Yelawolf wasn\'t quite out of the thick of his mind at this time but he was also clearly getting better.\r\n\r\nFollowing \"Trial By Fire\", in June of 2018, \"Love Story\" received a Gold certification for 500,000 units sold.Then 2019 came around.  As previously mentioned, \"Trunk Muzik\" would be getting another installment, and this time it would be an official studio album appropriately titled \"Trunk Muzik III\". Before the release of \"Trunk Muzik III\", Yelawolf began a tour to support the album where he premiered \"Catfish Billy 2\", a sequel to the fan favorite song from \"Trunk Muzik Returns\". It was during this tour that Yelawolf announced that \"Trunk Muzik III\" would be his last album before he departed from Shady records.This installment of the \"Trunk Muzik\" series would feature production from WLPWR, DJ Paul of Three 6 Mafia, and Jim Jonsin as well as others. This album would also feature a wide variety of artists such as Caskey, Doobie, Rittz, and a posthumous verse from Shawtty Fatt, as well as a verse from Machine Gun Kelly, which marked an end to the beef between the two. However this did not come without its consequences, as Yelawolf was signed to Shady Records, and under Eminem\'s wing, and he was featuring MGK on a song right as the beef between MGK and Eminem was heating up, which many fans took as disrespectful to Eminem (you may remember in \"Rap Devil\" when Machine Gun Kelly said, \"Don\'t be a sucker and take my verse off of Yelawolf\'s album, Thank you). The officially released lead single for \"Trunk Muzik III\" was the song \"TM3\" which sampled parts of the original \"Trunk Muzik\" track. Before the release of \"Trunk Muzik III\", Yelawolf began working on another Studio Album titled \"Ghetto Cowboy\", which would be his first independent release following leaving Shady Records. Also before releasing \"Trunk Muzik III\", Atha would release freestyles on YouTube as promotional content, similarly to how he did for \"Love Story\". At this time, Atha dyed his hair red as an homage to the character Opie Taylor from the once very popular, now classic, \"Andy Griffith Show\". Upon release, \"Trunk Muzik III\" received mixed reviews from fans as a lot of people felt it was overly packed with feature verses and felt more like a \'featuring Yelawolf album\' than a project of his own. Another common complaint was that many tracks felt like filler. Following this, Yelawolf put the finishing touches on \"Ghetto Cowboy\", and near the end of 2019 the album was released under his own label, \"Slumerican\". As promo for this album Atha began the \"Ghetto Cowboy Tour\", which was his second tour of 2019, and released the single \"Unnatural Born Killer\". Of the two albums released in 2019, \"Ghetto Cowboy\" was way more highly regarded by fans than \"Trunk Muzik III\" because many fans felt it was a much more cohesive and authentic Yelawolf project. Then following the Covid-19 pandemic, in 2021, Yelawolf dropped a bombshell on his fans. \r\n\r\nFor starters, in February of 2021, Yelawolf released an 11 track collaborative mixtape with Florida based independent rapper, Caskey. This project was called \"YELAWOLF BLACKSHEEP\" and was meant to be a brash and in your face, a loud fun project, and this was just the beginning. In March of 2021, Atha announced what he called \"April Onslaught\" which was where he would be releasing one project every week for the month of April. First up was \"TURQUOiSE TORNADO\", a collaboration EP with the internet personality turned rapper, RiFF RAFF. This project featured artists like Struggle Jennings and Peso Peso, and it received mixed reviews from fans, but it was popular enough for the song \"MiLLiOn DOLLAR MULLET\" to receive a chopped and screwed version. Next was \"Slumafia\", a collaborative project with producer DJ Paul, and it served as somewhat a spiritual successor to \"Black Fall\" from 2013. This project featured verses from Caskey, Seed of 6ix, Gangsta Boo, and DJ Paul himself as well as others. For the third week of April, \"Mile Zero\" with DJ Muggs of Cypress Hill was released and this project featured classic West Coast rap production with feature verses from Struggle Jennings, Bub Styles, Christian Rose, Del The Funky Homosapien as well as  guest vocals from country music superstar, Jelly Roll, and more features. Finally came the final release of April which was the studio album \"Mud Mouth\", which was a smash hit among fans, but many fans argued that the album could have received mainstream attention had Yelawolf had better management, specifically the songs \"Dog House\" and \"Aquanet\". Yelawolf stated that \"Mud Mouth\" would be his last rap project before he departed from the genre, and features the best rap skills. \r\n\r\nIn 2022, fans got to know where Yelawolf would be taking his career following his departure from rap... Rock N\' Roll. \"Sometimes Y\" would be Yelawolf\'s debut rock project, and it would be a collaboration with Shooter Jennings, the band\'s producer/guitarist. The lead single, \"Make Me A Believer\"  was starkly different from anything Yelawolf had done up to that point, and in March of 2022 the full album was released. This album received some radio play but Yelawolf has stated he wasn\'t very happy with how the project had turned out. A sequel called \"Temples Chariot\" is supposedly in the works however it\'s status is unknown. \r\n\r\nFollowing the release of \"Sometimes Y\", Yelawolf posted with Caskey about a sequel to \"YELAWOLF BLACK SHEEP\" titled \"Get Some\", but nothing more came of this as of 2024. \r\n\r\nEven though \"Mud Mouth\" was supposed to be Yelawolf\'s last rap project, in 2023 he announced \"War Story\", which would be a spiritual successor to \"Love Story\", with the irony being that \"Love Story\" was harsher and \"War Story\" was more of a story of a full career. Yelawolf used \"War Story\" as a means to begin a TikTok page where he would promote his music, and he used that platform to push the first single, \"Everything\" which was a boastful track about being the best there is, and completing his goals, and reaching everything he wanted in life. Accompanying this was a music video featuring Cowboy Killer, DJ Paul, DJ Klever, and other big names in the \'Slumerican Family\'. The next single was \"Make You Love Me\", which was originally thought to have been named \"Make You F**k Me\" by fans. This single was also accompanied by a music video, this time depicting a murder taking place in the early 1900\'s. Next up was \"New Me\" which was another boastful track about reinventing himself. Finally came \"Trailer In The Sky\" (ft. Jelly Roll) and this song was polarizing amongst fans because many thought it was lazy. This song did not receive a traditional music video, instead getting an animated video. Finally, in June of 2024, the double album \"War Story\" was released. The first side of the album was titled \"Michael Wayne\" and featured production from Malay. The first side was a story about Yelawolf\'s life which was fitting due to the title. The second side of the album was the fourth installment in the \"Trunk Muzik\" series titled \"Trunk Muzik Forever\". The album featured verses from Killer Mike, Bub Styles, DJ Paul, Struggle Jennings, and more. \r\n\r\nAs of Now, Yelawolf has not released any more music, however there is supposedly a collaboration between British producer, Kordhell, who is prominent in the Phonk Scene, and Atha in the works. This album is apparently going to be a new genre that they\'re pioneering called \"Country Phonk\". There are also still talks of \"Temples Chariot\", another rock album, as well as \"Get Some\". \r\n\r\nAs of December 30th, 2024 Yelawolf will be 45 years old, and who knows where his career is going from here. He\'s had an extremely long, storied, and weird career. Where will we see him next? The Gathering of the Juggalos (again)? Or in another movie (The Peanut Butter Falcon)? Who knows, but until then, stay Slum! <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Yelawolf\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Saba\'s contributions to Chance songs like 2013\'s \"Everybody\'s Something\" and 2015\'s \"Angels\" showcased his range as both a rapper and vocalist and paved the way for his introspective debut studio album, Bucket List Project, in 2016. The loss of a close family member inspired 2018\'s Care for Me, a tragically beautiful album that explored death, mourning, and life after losing a loved one.\r\n\r\nSaba (Tahj Malik Chandler) grew up on the West Side of Chicago, specifically within the Austin neighborhood, as part of a deeply musical family. That\'s also where he formed Pivot Gang, a group of longtime associates that has featured, among others, his brother Jerrel (aka Joseph Chilliams), cousin Walter Long (aka John Walt), Logan Yutters (aka MFn Melo), Frsh Waters, and DJ Damnage. Saba recorded several solo mixtapes -- his first were issued while he was an introverted high-schooler -- and gained traction with ComfortZone, a 2014 release inspired by his father\'s neo-soul recordings that capitalized on his contributions to awareness-raising tracks by fellow Chicagoans Chance the Rapper and Mick Jenkins. In 2015, Saba appeared as featured artist on several cuts, including Chance\'s \"Angels,\" Jenkins\' \"Slumber,\" and Odd Couple\'s \"What Kings Do.\" Additionally, he released the reflective Tink collaboration \"Temporary,\" one of his most commercial songs to date.\r\n\r\nIn late 2016, Saba self-released the LP Bucket List Project, featuring artists like fellow Chicagoan rappers Noname and Twista. In February of 2017, Saba\'s cousin, mentor, and Pivot Gang collaborator Walter Long was violently murdered by a stranger. Saba reflected on the scars left by this horrible loss throughout his second album,  CARE FOR ME, which was released in April of 2018. The vulnerable and emotionally complex album broke through with critics and took Saba\'s music to new audiences. He followed in November of that year with \"Beautiful Smile,\" a collaborative single with Maryland rapper IDK.\r\n\r\n2) Anna Saba Lykke Oehlenschlæger, known as SABA, is an Ethiopian-born Danish singer, actress and model. She represented Denmark at the Eurovision Song Contest 2024 with her song \"SAND\". \r\n\r\nShe was born on the 11th of August, 1997 with her twin sister  Andrea Lykke Oehlenschlæger in Addis Abba, Ethiopia.

On 25 January 2024, SABA was announced as one of the participants of Dansk Melodi Grand Prix 2024, the Danish national final for the Eurovision Song Contest 2024, with the song \"Sand\".

Through the early stages of 2018, the rapper tested new ideas, releasing the singer-songwriter style of \"We\'re All Lost\" and the confident, upbeat \"Listen.\" But it was on \"She\'s My Lover Girl\" that the rapper would find his signature sound: converting short samples into mellow, looping production, Ward used his low-toned vocals to create one- to two-minute rap ballads, lamenting lost loves and pining after the objects of his affection. The rapper\'s second song in this style, the jazzier \"Princess Bubblegum,\" became one of his breakout hits and by 2021, it had received over 100 million digital streams.\r\n\r\nAfter closing out the year with similar tracks like \"Mia Wallace\" and \"Table for Two,\" Ward adopted a cockier sound in the early stages of 2019, working with Savage Ga$p and Keshore for the hedonistic \"It\'s Only Right to Fall in Love Twice\" and dropping further tracks \"Lavagirl\" and \"PEP$I.\" His creative synergy with Savage Ga$p would continue in a second major hit, the Legend of Zelda-sampling \"Tunnel of Love,\" followed by the more melancholy stylings of \"Please Pick Up\" and \"Us vs. the World.\" A third major hit, \"Forever,\" arrived shortly after: with its evocative sample of Yuna\'s \"Lullabies,\" the track spun troubled romances and personal struggles into an intoxicating blend and soon garnered more than 100 million streams online.\r\n\r\nWard moved into 2020 alongside Savage Ga$p: the duo dropped \"Maybe It\'s for the Best,\" and the \"Tunnel of Love (Remix)\" in late 2019, before collaborating on tracks \"Like Dat\" and \"I\'m Drunk and I Miss You Too\" in early 2020. A few solo tracks, including the vocally led \"Jennifer\'s Body,\" closed out the year before the rapper continued into 2021 with tracks \"Paris Hilton\" and \"Tinkerbell.\"\r\n\r\nHe built his love-driven rap sounds on bare-bones samples and narratives of conflicted romance. His mellow approach to the genre found a major following in the early 2020s, with tracks like \"Forever\" and \"Princess Bubblegum\" racking up more than 100 million streams apiece. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/ilyTOMMY\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

His parents\' military service caused the family to move on a regular basis. \r\nOver the next thirteen years, he would move between Pittsburgh and South Carolina, Georgia, Oklahoma, Germany, Japan, and England as his parents were reassigned to different posts. In October of 1990 Wiz was separated from his mother,who left him in the hands of her sister while she served in Operation Desert Storm.\r\n\r\nDuring his travels, Wiz was forced to mature quicker than his peers. He was constantly faced with new surroundings, new schools, and new sets of friends, and he found it difficult to become attached to anyone outside his family roots. This nomadic life gave Wiz an opportunity, though, to broaden his mind and offered him many experiences from which to draw inspiration. He began to perceive the world differently than most kids, and he would write his thoughts down every day.These thoughts would become the foundation for his future recordings.\r\n\r\nBy the age of 14, with a few songs under his belt, Wiz was already drawing comparisons with his commanding voice and witty wordplay. While he has been influenced by artists such as Jay-Z, Camron, and the Notorious B.I.G., Wiz was determined to create his own identity that would, one day, be loved and revered by fans.\r\n\r\nReady to take the next step, Wiz began his search for a recording studio to record new songs. He found one, ID LABS, where owner Eric Dan immediately recognized Wiz\'s talents. Along with Chad Glick of ID Management, they began to network Wiz to another Pittsburgh native, Benjy Grinberg of Rostrum Records. Benjy realized the raw talent that Wiz possessed, and immediately brought him into the Rostrum family in 2002.\r\n\r\nSoon after, Wiz Khalifa began his ascent into the music scene in the Pittsburgh area. He has been hailed by the award winning Pittsburgh Post-Gazette pop music critic, Ed Masley, as having “the skills, the looks, the confidence, the drive, and the charisma for the job.” The New Pittsburgh Courier says, “The combination of a young, charismatic M.C. with a slew of stop-and-rewind rhymes together with a local independent label with major industry connections has set the stage for a hip-hop artist representing Pittsburgh to reach superstar status for the first time ever.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, with the success of Kush and Orange Juice still present, Wiz Khalifa signed with Atlantic Records. Wiz\'s style along with his production team, Johnny Juliano, Sledgren, and E. Dan make this a winning combination for success. \r\n\r\nHe is also well known for his debut single for Atlantic, \"Black and Yellow\", which peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100. His debut album for the label, Rolling Papers, was released on March 29, 2011. He followed that album with O.N.I.F.C. (abbreviated for mainstream markets from \"Only Nigga In First Class\") on December 4, 2012 which was backed by the singles \"Work Hard, Play Hard\" and \"Remember You\". O.N.I.F.C. debuted at number two with 131,000 in first week sales.\r\n\r\nPittsburgh City Council declared 12-12-12 (December 12, 2012) to be Wiz Khalifa Day in the city. Khalifa graduated from Pittsburgh\'s Taylor Allderdice High School and in January 2012, purchased a home in nearby Canonsburg, Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nIn April 2013, Khalifa revealed that after having his son he decided to work on a new album that he was planning to release in 2013. On April 17, 2013, Wiz Khalifa and Curren$y announced that they will drop their collaboration EP Live in Concert on April 20, 2013. The EP featured seven new songs. On June 24, 2013, he announced that his fifth studio album would be titled Blacc Hollywood and would be released in 2013. On September 3, 2013, Khalifa revealed he had recorded songs with Miley Cyrus, Adele and Juicy J for Blacc Hollywood. In October 2013, Mannie Fresh confirmed that he provided production for the album. On February 11, 2014, Khalifa released Blacc Hollywood\'s first single titled \"We Dem Boyz\". The album was then supported by the singles \"KK\", \"You and Your Friends\", \"Stayin Out All Night\", \"Promises\" and \"So High\". \r\n\r\nKhalifa released an EP with TY Dolla $ign on March 31, 2015, entitled \"Talk About It In the Morning\". That same month, Wiz released the lead single for the film \"Furious 7\" called \"See You Again\" as a tribute to Paul Walker. The single has since gone on to global success. \"See You Again\" spent 12 non-consecutive weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, tying for the longest-running rap number-one hit in the US. \r\n\r\nOn January 23, 2015, Khalifa was featured on a remix release of the Fall Out Boy song \"Uma Thurman\". On May 18, they performed the song together on the 2015 Billboard Music Awards show. In the summer of 2015, he began touring the United States with Fall Out Boy and Hoodie Allen in a tour titled \"The Boys of Zummer Tour\". The tour featured performances of \"Uma Thurman\" by Fall Out Boy and Khalifa. Later that year, on December 15, 2015, Wiz released the mixtape \"Cabin Fever 3\". During the Golden Globes on January 10, 2016, Wiz announced that his next album, titled Khalifa, would be released on the 22nd of that month. However, the album was released on February 5, 2016. On May 24, 2016, he released \"Pull Up\", a standalone single in promotion of his sixth album, Rolling Papers 2, which was released on July 13, 2018.\r\n\r\nOn April 20, 2020, Khalifa released, The Saga of Wiz Khalifa. The album included collaborations with Tyga, Logic, Mustard and Ty Dolla $ign. In May 2020, Khalifa featured on the song \"Drums Drums Drums\" with Travis Barker.\r\n\r\nIn 2021, Khalifa competed in season five of The Masked Singer as \"Chameleon\".

His sound fluctuates between high-energy trap music and stripped-back R&B, all laced with uniquely catchy cadences and rhythms. His first release, the anthem \"PUTIN\", quickly gained attention online, amassing over 1 million Spotify streams since its release in late 2018.\r\n\r\nSince then, Martyr has significantly increased his online following, mostly fuelled by a steady stream of quality single releases and a unique approach to social media marketing.

In 2005 he released his independent debut album, Trap House, which featured the successful single \"Icy\" that he recorded with Young Jeezy. He has since released a further three albums including 2006\'s Hard To Kill, 2007\'s Trap-A-Thon and 2007\'s Back To The Trap House. His sixth studio album, The State vs Radric Davis, was released in December 2009, just weeks after he was sent back to prison for 12 months for violating his probation. He was released in May 2010 and will now release his seventh studio album, The Appeal: Georgia\'s Most Wanted, sometime at the end of 2010.\r\n\r\nIt’s said that art mirrors life. In hip-hop’s case, there’s always been a deliberate entanglement of perception and reality. Fans demand their MCs be real…but never too real. Successful hip-hop is about the hint of the danger, the tease of it, the mystique. Hip-hop is about balance.\r\n\r\nGucci Mane is an artist striving for that balance, volatility versus musicality. Controversy, including a feud with former collaborator Young Jeezy, has grabbed the headlines, with insufficient regard paid to his considerable mic skills, raw talent, and business acumen. Gucci is looking to wrest his name from public speculation and let his own words do the talking.\r\n\r\n“I wish everybody well who’s making money in this rap game,” the Atlanta-raised rapper says, dismissing the controversy that followed him in the past. “My own rap game is going so good, I’ve got so many things on my plate at my label, that I don’t got time for other people’s business.” With a deal with Asylum Records as the boss of his own label, So Icey Entertainment, Gucci does indeed have a full schedule with no time to dwell on the past.\r\n\r\n“I live my life with no regrets. I just wish that a lot of things never happened, but anybody can wish,” says Gucci. Sounds like a man with his eyes on the prize. And you’d expect nothing less from an artist who ground his way to the top via the hustle of independent records. Signing to Big Cat Records in the wake of his local single “Black Tee,” he dropped his debut record, Trap House, in May 2005. The independent album moved an impressive 140,000 units, largely on the strength of the “Icy” single, featuring Jeezy. Clamor over song rights sparked dispute, and the resulting rift grew.\r\n\r\nControversy notwithstanding, Mane’s independence was cemented: “I was on the independent scene for about two years,” he recalls. “It’s crazy! You gotta go into your own pocket to support your craft. You need other avenues to have money coming in, to support your stuff. You might win, you might lose, and it’s a gamble out there with the independent circuit. One thing you’d better have is good music because without that, you go downhill fast in the independent game.”\r\n\r\nGood music firmly in hand, Gucci was fast approaching stardom when more tragedy befell him. But let’s backtrack; how did the man born Radric Davis in Bessemer, Alabama, become Gucci Mane, mouthpiece for Atlanta stuntin’? Mane remembers little from his time in Alabama, just that it was rural, and that it’s changed dramatically since he left at the age of nine. “I gotta shout out Alabama though, because they holdin’ it down,” he affirms. “Every time I go there to do a show, I’m impressed with how hip-hop culture has taken root.”\r\n\r\nMane’s identity coalesced when he moved with his mother to Atlanta. “I lived all of my adolescent and adult life in Atlanta,” he explains. “I’m from East Atlanta Zone Six; it was hard, man, it was real rough. I grew up in the Starter jacket era: they’d take your Starter jacket, your 8Ball jacket, they’d take your hat, your shoes. It was just no holds barred on the streets, dog eat dog. If you missed the bus, you had to be crewed up or you’d get jumped. It was wild when I came up.”\r\n\r\nIt’s a bleak portrait. When asked to describe his home life more vividly, Mane offers a look into his contemplative side, a side honed as a schoolyard poet. “I was just a young dude in a single parent house most of my life. I can’t complain that much. I would guess it’s like any black child growing up in a single parent household. There are a lot of people who know how that is. I didn’t have a lot coming up; but what I did have, I appreciated. I was blessed to have a caring mother to raise me right and to help me with my business ventures; she’s been there through the whole struggle. There’s a lot that goes along with that; it made me who I am today.”\r\n\r\nA stepfather would enter the picture during Mane’s adolescence, introducing not only a male figure, but also inspiration for Mane’s unusual moniker. “My father came in, the original Gucci Mane; that’s what people in the neighborhood called him, and that’s where I get my name from. From then on, I grew up the son of a hustler and a schoolteacher; it was the best of both worlds because I was educated twice.” Drawing inspiration from a pantheon of rappers before him –Big Daddy Kane, LL Cool J, Ice Cube, the Beastie Boys, N.W.A—Mane went on to release Trap House, a lethal brew of his signature sound: “I call my music straight Gucci: going hard and whatever beats you make you for me, if I’m feeling it, if I’m rocking with it, I’m gonna crush it. When you hear me, you hear a lot of pain, a lot of hood; you hear what’s going on in the inner city in Atlanta.”\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Trap House was ill timed; the month of its release, Gucci was accused of murder and jailed for two days. Eventually deemed to be acting in self-defense, and without sufficient evidence to hold him, Mane was exonerated. But the ordeal left an indelible imprint on the man. “I learned to keep better company, watch where I go, and be mindful of my surroundings at all times,” he reveals. “Watch what I say, watch what I do and how I do it, just keep myself out of the wrong crowd.”\r\n\r\n“I always stand up man,” he continues. “I’m one of the toughest guys I know. It’ll take a lot more than that to break me down.” Undeterred, Mane was back in the studio, preparing 2006’s eerily apropos Hard To Kill. The buzz from Hard To Kill vaulted Gucci Mane from regional commodity to national treasure, and major labels responded accordingly: “There was a bidding war going on, and I liked Atlantic’s approach. They made it known that they wanted me, they felt where I was going and that I could grow with them.”\r\n\r\nAsylum/Atlantic Records welcomed Gucci Mane in early ’07, granting him his own imprint, So Icey Entertainment. With it comes an entire stable of artists, the So Icey Boyz. As the Boyz ready for their own exposure –“I got them in training; they be in the weight room, pumping iron, doing pushups, shopping at the mall, buying ice”—Gucci is focused on his magnum opus, Back to the Trap House. “I started working on the album, and by the third song, I was like ‘This is going back to the Trap House.’ I started feeling the same way I did when I made my first album. It had the same feel to it, the same freshness. And I had the same hunger and desire I had when I first started rapping.”\r\n\r\n“Since I went major, I want everybody to know I’m still keeping it street, keeping it hood,” Gucci maintains. “I’m trying to take it back to all my fans that I had when I first started my career. And at the same time, I’m trying to open up my new album to a new fan base. So it’s a mix for everybody coming together, like my first album was.” Gucci has always prided himself on his innate ability, and his refusal to let guest appearances dictate the tone of his records. “I just want people to know I’m a great songwriter, man,” he asserts. “I’m passionate about what I do, and it’s choreographed strategically when I do it. I bring a lot of experience, creative wordplay, and a crazy style. And my albums, I record most of the songs without writing them down; it’s a God-given gift and I just get paid for it. It come from God, it’s like wondering what makes a bird fly. He made me a poet like the great poets of the past.”\r\n\r\nBut don’t mistake Gucci’s confidence for self-absorption. The vicissitudes of his career have dictated a longer view. Lyrics aside, he’s less preoccupied with visible means and more so with acting as an emissary from his under-repped block. “I’m not the one to glorify what goes on in the hood,” he insists. “We have everything there, the whole range from violence to people getting on the bus and going to work. There’s a lot more to the hood than just drugs. It’s a bigger story, there’s a big picture. I went to school in that neighborhood, I worked there, I trapped there, I hustled there, and I got my name there. I’m proud to be from East Atlanta Zone Six, and I claim there. I hold that on my back and carry that, to be the first one from there to really rock.”\r\n\r\nAnd Gucci’s professional aims have matured as well. While other rappers stress platinum plaques, Gucci hasn’t forgotten the route he took to stardom. “I made a lot of CDs on my own. People fucked with me and supported me, and just made me the man I am today. That’s my blueprint right there, and I stay mindful of it. So now, my only concern is that people feel my music; at the end of the day, I do it for people to feel it. If one person feel it, two people feel it, I feel like my job’s been done.”\r\n\r\nFortunately for Gucci, he should be prepared to welcome an army of new fans with Back to the Trap House. But longstanding fans shouldn’t fear; they’ll recognize “Freaky Gurl,” reprised from its previous appearance from Hard To Kill. Luda, upon hearing the joint, asked for a guest spot on the remix. Said remix now appears as the lead single on Back to the Trap House, following in Gucci’s theme of mating old and new. Over a bouncing, meandering beat from Cyber Sapp, the two cook up the requisite concoction of whips, chips, and chicks. Also look out for “Bird Flu,” the album’s number two single, laced by New-York based Supa Sonics. Elsewhere, firm guest verses from Rich Boy and Pimp C of UGK round out Gucci’s regional flavor, while Bay-area producer Zaytoven (of “Icy” renown) locks down Gucci’s West Coast appeal.\r\n\r\nGucci Mane has something for everyone, and with the struggles of the past in his rearview, Gucci is settled in for his ride to the top. “I’m best known for controversy but I’m trying to gain respect as a songwriter and entertainer. I plan to hit them so hard with this album; who knows what the future will bring. I’ll be banging them out till I can’t bang no more.”\r\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Gucci+Mane\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

He shot to fame in September 2007, when his single “Crank That (Soulja Boy)” reached number one on the Billboard Top 100. He released his debut album, Unsigned & Still Major: Da Album Before da Album in 2007 and followed this with 2007’s souljaboytellem.com and 2008’s iSouljaBoyTellem. His fourth studio album, The DeAndre Way, was released on November 2010.\r\n\r\nEarly life\r\n\r\nBorn DeAndre Ramone Way in Chicago, Illinois on July 28, 1990, Way moved from Chicago to Atlanta, Georgia at age seven, where he became interested in rap music. At age 14, he moved to Batesville, Mississippi with his father, who provided a recording studio for Way to explore his musical ambitions.\r\n\r\nCareer\r\n\r\nIn November 2005, Way posted his songs on the video-based social community YouTube. Following positive reviews on the site, Soulja Boy then established his own web pages on YouTube and MySpace. In March 2007, he recorded “Crank That” and released his first independent album Unsigned and Still Major, followed by a low-budget video filmed demonstrating the “Soulja Boy” dance. By the end of May 2007, “Crank That (Soulja Boy)” received its first airplay and Soulja Boy met with Mr. Collipark to sign a deal with Interscope Records.\r\n\r\nOn August 12, 2007, the song appeared on the Emmy-award winning HBO series Entourage, and by September 1, it topped the Billboard Hot 100 and Hot RingMasters charts. Way’s major label debut album Souljaboytellem.com, which was reportedly recorded using just the demo version of FL Studio, was released in the United States on October 2, peaking at #4 on both the Billboard 200 and Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums charts.\r\n\r\nOn December 9, 2007, Way was sued by William Lyons (aka Souljah Boy of the Mo Thugs) who claims he first created the stage name “Souljah Boy”.\r\n\r\nFor the 50th Grammy Awards, Soulja Boy was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rap Song with “Crank That (Soulja Boy)”. He lost to Kanye West’s and T-Pain’s “Good Life”.\r\n\r\nThe teen rapper recently inked a deal with Dallas-based company, Yums Shoes, for a line of his own sneakers called the “Block Star” and an apparel line. “The Soulja boy exclusive shoe will be released in the fall along with my album,” he said. “The Soulja Boy cartoon will also be released in the fall, so there’s three things to look out for.” The line will be unveiled at the fall Magic fashion trade show in Las Vegas later this year, and the rapper will appear in both television and print ads for it.\r\n\r\nSoulja Boy says he will not use better lyrics and get more respect from the rap game, although he could, because it will ruin his reputation and image.\r\n\r\n\r\nInitial reception\r\n\r\nThe album Souljaboytellem.com was met with mostly negative reviews, despite a positive one from Allmusic. Several reviewers credited Soulja Boy with spearheading a new trend in hip-hop, while speculating he will likely be a one hit wonder.\r\n\r\nCritics and hip-hop figures such as Snoop Dogg, 50 Cent, and Jermaine Dupri cite Soulja Boy as artistically typical of contemporary rap trends such as writing for the lucrative ringtone market, and the ascendence of “Southern hip hop”, emphasizing catchy, mindless music that discards rap’s traditional emphasis on message. And even one article about his songs and heavily criticizing his musical style has dubbed Soulja Boy the “Nickelback of hip hop”. Soulja Boy identifies his goal as making upbeat, party-themed music that avoids the negative, violent image that he sees in most hip-hop. Despite this, his music has been banned from some school dances for sexual, pro-violence content or innuendo and, ironically, many of his recent recordings feature violent content and sexual innuendo. In the original YouTube video for “Shootout”, Way demonstrates his dance while holding a handgun in each hand and pretending to shoot into the audience.\r\n\r\nFeud with Ice-T\r\n\r\nIn June 2008, on DJ Cisco’s Urban Legend mixtape, Ice-T criticized Soulja Boy for “killing hip-hop” and his song “Crank That” for being “garbage” compared to the works of other hip-hop artists as Rakim, Das EFX, Big Daddy Kane and Ice Cube. Soulja Boy responded in a YouTube video by mocking Ice-T’s age (Ice-T was born in 1958) and claiming that he needed to support his family through his brand of music. Ice-T proceeded to offer a video response to Soulja Boy’s reaction in which he neglected to offer an apology while reiterating his belief that Soula Boy’s music was “garbage”. Rapper Kanye West defended Soulja Boy by arguing that Soulja Boy created a new, original work for hip-hop, thus keeping the authentic meaning of the music. Soulja Boy followed suit by buying Ice-T a flaming set of gigantic popcorn machines.\r\n\r\nReferences in popular culture\r\n\r\nSoulja Boy recently became an item in the first round NBA playoff series between the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Washington Wizards. In a bout of trash talking before the start of the series, Wizards guard Deshawn Stevenson called Cleveland superstar LeBron James “overrated,” prompting James to say that he wouldn’t return the insult, as that would be “almost like Jay-Z [responding to a negative comment] made by Soulja Boy.” Soulja Boy made an appearance at Game 3 of the series (played in Washington) in support of the Wizards; his music was played over the PA system. Despite his team losing the game by more than 30 points and LeBron posting poor numbers (compared to his exceptionally high averages), LeBron claims that the trick had no effect on him, and that his young son is a big fan of Soulja Boy. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Soulja+Boy\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

He was previously signed to Interscope Records before being let go from his deal without an official record being released. He has released five mixtapes since his first in 2005 including Live From Gary, Indiana, Big Bizness, The Miseducation of Freddie Gibbs, midwestgangstaboxframecadillacmuzik and Str8 Killa No Filla. The Str8 Killa EP was released 3rd August. His debut LP Baby-Faced Killa and The Devil\'s Palace, a collaborative project with The Alchemist, were both released in 2012. He then would go on to release Cold Day in Hell in 2012, and ESGN in 2013. In 2014, Gibbs released Pinata, a collaborative album with producer Madlib, and The Tonite Show, another collaborative album with The World\'s Freshest. Gibbs newest album Shadow of a Doubt is planned to best released on November 20th via ESGN / EMPIRE.\r\n\r\nHailing from Gary, Indiana, a place whose murder and crime rates have ranked it several times at the top of the \"Most Dangerous Cities\" list, Freddie Gibbs is the true definition of a street survivor. Raised on Gary\'s east side, Gibbs lived the hard life firsthand in a run-down industrial community plagued with vice and ignored by the establishment. After playing at Ball State on a football scholarship, Gibbs was kicked out of college. Over the next few years he went through court-ordered boot camp, joined and got discharged from the military, and held down a series of 9 to 5 jobs without success. Feeling like the system had failed him, Gibbs turned to hustling; pimping and selling crack out of a local house. Inspired by rappers like UGK, The Geto Boys, and 2Pac, Gibbs started rhyming about his life and the issues facing urban youth in Gary and the countless other impoverished cities just like it.  Gibbs is the first rapper signed to a major label from Gary.\r\n\r\nThe Steel City\'s most famous musical residents to date are the Jackson 5, whose name still adorns a marquee on a falling-apart theater in Gary\'s blighted downtown. His desire to rep the Midwest and his city led Gibbs to start recording mixtapes and pushing them online as well as the streets, where he quickly began garnering fans drawn to his original style, diverse flows, and deeply personal lyrics about his experience as a young black man growing up below the poverty line in a forgotten American city. \r\n\r\nFreddie has worked with respected producers like Madlib, Red Spyda, Just Blaze, Buckwild, the Alchemist, Polow Da Don, and Collipark among many others. Gibbs cites Houston rap and Pac as his major influences, and it shows in his ability to alternate between chillingly tense street stories of violence and laid back comedic tales about women and weed. Ultimately Gibbs shows and proves with his rhymes, which demonstrate the promise of a legend in the making. His skills, wit, and street credibility establish Freddie Gibbs as a true artist. He\'s ready to represent for Gary, the Midwest, and anyone who relates to the struggle of inner city life. As Gibbs tells it: \"My music is definitely on some gangsta shit. That\'s what I was raised on and what I witnessed. How can I speak on anything else?\" \"Become a fan now, or become one later.\" <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Freddie+Gibbs\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

On September 24th, 1981 in Washington DC, Miguel Duran was born. His father would make it a point to teach Miguel everything he knew about music. He knew it wouldn\'t be an easy task to raise a kid in a cruel harsh world, but he had faith that music would show him the right path.\r\nListening to the cling and the clatter of the timbales in salsa and Merengue on a vinyl LP in his living room, is where Miguel would learn who great singers such as Frankie Ruiz, Juan Luis Guerra, Hector Lavo, and others were that had a tremendous impact in his own culture, in Latin music. Outside of his home, Miguel would be known as Fuego. On the streets speakers would fill the air with strong beats and rattle the houses with bass sounds showing a thunderous demonstration of love for hip-hop and rap. He\'d learn who Biggie Smalls, Tu-Pac, Bone Thugs, and Big Pun were. He\'d listen intensely to their style and the way they would flow with their unforgettable rhymes and cherished hooks. The street was his classroom, and his main subject was hip-hop. Within those two worlds is where Fuego would look within himself and make his distinctive style of music.\r\nIn 1998 he formed part of a group called 3MEN2 (Tremendo). The group tried very hard to work together and to take their music to the public. However, times were difficult. Each member had to think about how they were going to sustain themselves before following their true passion, music. Unfortunately, everyone decided to go separate ways. Nevertheless, Fuego didn\'t let that become a reason to give up. He knew that music was his calling. He began to write song after song and tried to get onto as many recordings around his way. He was then given the chance to perform solo. \r\nIn a college auditorium he had to prove to the audience that he was meant to be a star. On stage he began to astonish his audience, with his mesmerizing lyrics and his incredible hooks. The girls started to chant Fuego\'s name, and music became his enlightenment. Fuego also discovered that his key to his music would be to romanticize his female audience. Music had become his motivation, his fuel. \r\nAlong his path he met DJ Menace. DJ Menace knew that Fuego had potential and the drive to make it in the music industry. He began to help him gain exposure in the area. Menace would book him on local radio stations and shows around Maryland and DC. Menace didn\'t just introduce Reggaeton to DC and Maryland but he also introduced Fuego to the area. Fuego began to gain recognition in the area by performing every week. With the help from DJ Menace he was getting the practice he needed to one day perform nationwide. Sadly, DJ Menace was involved in a fatal car accident in 2003. Fuego was struck by the news but was given another reason to keep performing. His luck would soon change with his encounter of a very well known duo in the Reggaeton genre, in which would help Fuego\'s path in his musical career. \r\nOne evening in one of Fuego\'s performances, a member of Plan B watched his show. Fuego\'s undeniable talent amazed Chencho. Chencho knew he had to work with him and introduced him to Boy Wonder a well-known producer in the genre. . Boy Wonder was also highly impressed with his exceptional style, and was convinced Fuego could take the genre to the next step. Fuego felt that he was in the right hands and was able to record his track \"Me Gustan Todas\" featured on \"EL Draft O5\". The track became one of the top five singles of the album. Without hesitation Fuego made a decision to sign with Chosen Few Emerald Entertainment. \r\nSince then Fuego\'s been able to do collaborations with some of the heavy weights in Reggaeton and Latin Hip-hop. He\'s been featured in albums such as El Draft 2005, Bob Marley, and Chosen Few El Documental II. Boy Wonder can best describe him as \"Young, fresh, and multi-creative with a dynamic style of singing, rapping, and flowin. He is and will be like the title of his album \"Untouchable\". Fuego currently is working on his own album, which will be released in 2007. He will also featured on LDA, Reychesta, and Getto\'s albums, and more of Chosen Few productions. He believes that his purpose is \"Bringing something different to the table. Creating different and innovative sounds. Wanting to really blow up the genre, and bring out the soul in Latin hip hop.\"\r\n---\r\n2) Paul Surugiu:\r\nFuego is not a traditional Christmas artist, but he does a good job, in my opinion singing carols on winter time.

As a member of the British/Irish boy band One Direction, singer Harry Styles topped the charts, toured the world, and sold millions of albums before going solo in 2016. Styles was raised in Holmes Chapel, Cheshire, and he made his first foray into music with a high-school band named White Eskimo. In 2010, he left home and joined the seventh season of The X Factor, where fate and Simon Cowell would eventually lead him toward a life-changing opportunity with four other young men. As One Direction, Styles and his group mates Zayn Malik, Louis Tomlinson, Niall Horan, and Liam Payne would release five albums from 2011 to 2015, hitting number one across the globe and selling millions of records to an adoring and rabid fan base that drew comparisons to the fervor at the height of Beatlemania. In early 2016, after Malik had already parted ways with 1D, the remaining foursome announced their indefinite hiatus.\r\n\r\nMonths later, Styles signed a solo deal with Columbia Records. Reflecting the influence of childhood favorites like Queen, Elton John, Fleetwood Mac, The Rolling Stones, Freddy Mercury, and The Beatles, Styles\' solo material took a more serious and rock-based approach, while still delivering the pop sound his faithful 1D fans desired.

On their 2010 breakthrough \"Go Outside,\" dream pop haze and \'60s girl group harmonies provided the perfect backdrop for Follin\'s sweetly empathetic vocals, creating the template for Cults\' sound. On the albums that followed, the duo gave different nuances to this style. They added Technicolor vibrancy to 2011\'s Cults; darkness that echoed the end of their romantic relationship on 2013\'s Static; and a streamlined approach that reflected the electro-pop purveyors that sprang up in their wake on 2017\'s Offering. On this album and 2020\'s Host, Follin\'s growing creative input reinforced the delicate yet enduring appeal of Cults\' music.\r\n\r\nCults formed in 2010, when native San Franciscans Follin and Oblivion were attending school in New York City (Oblivion was a documentary film student at NYU; Follin was studying at the New School). A couple at the time, they wrote and recorded songs in Oblivion\'s apartment using a computer and a cheap midi keyboard, and before the year was over, they released their self-titled debut EP on Forest Family Records. One of the EP\'s songs, \"Go Outside,\" which Cults recorded with Paul Kostabi at Thunderdome Studios, became a viral hit, earning acclaim from publications including Pitchfork and NME.\r\n\r\nCults built on the success of \"Go Outside\" by touring with Richie Follin\'s Band (the project of Madeline\'s older brother) for six months. They then signed to In the Name Of, an imprint of Columbia Records founded by Lily Allen. Produced by Shane Stoneback, Cults\' June 2011 self-titled album delivered more of their atmospheric, retro-futuristic indie pop and charted in the U.K., Canada, and the U.S., reaching number 52 on Billboard\'s Top 200 Albums Chart. That year, the duo also appeared on the AIDS/HIV research benefit album Red Hot+Rio 2, collaborating with Superhuman Happiness on a cover of \"Um Canto de Afoxé para o Bloco Do Ilê.\" Along with touring in support of the album, Cults also appeared at the Portishead-curated ATP I\'ll Be Your Mirror festival that September and at ATP\'s Nightmare Before Christmas festival, which was curated by Battles, that December.\r\n\r\nIn October 2013, Cults returned with their second album, Static. Recorded with Stoneback in the wake of Follin and Oblivion\'s breakup, it won strong reviews for its emotive songwriting and peaked at number 114 on the Billboard Top 200. That month, the duo also appeared with Amber Coffman on J. Cole\'s \"She Knows\" from his album Born Sinner; the song hit number 90 on the Billboard Hot 100 Singles Chart. Following the 2014 single \"Being It,\" Cults took some time off. In 2016, Follin formed the group Follin with her brother Richie, and released the single \"Roxy\" that February.\r\n\r\nFor their next album, Cults took a more collaborative approach, with Follin playing drums and keyboards as well as singing. After working with Stoneback in New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco studios, Cults emerged in October 2017 with Offering, which borrowed from influences as wide-ranging as Pink Floyd, Gary Numan, and the Motels, whose music they\'d fallen in love with while touring with Total Control in Australia. They explored their passion for the Motels further in 2018 with a track-by-track cover of the band\'s 1979 self-titled debut that was part of Turntable Kitchen\'s Sounds Delicious series. The following year saw the release of Offering B Sides & Remixes, which featured reworkings of the album\'s tracks by Mike Simonetti, Etienne de Crecy, and John Fryer.\r\n\r\nCults began work on their next album in early 2019, teaming with Stoneback on songs that, for the first time, featured live instrumentation and included lyrics by Follin. Mixed by John Congleton and mastered by Heba Kadry, Host appeared in September 2020 and tackled themes of identity and independence.\r\n\r\nBiography by  Heather Phares <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Cults\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

For this 6’4, blue-eyed, country crooner from Jacksonville, AL it’s not just a “Country State of Mind” - it’s a lifestyle. \r\n\r\nRiley has achieved an incredible amount of success for someone doing it all on their own. Though you wouldn’t know it by talking to him, Green is as humble as they come for someone who has released three popular EP’s, stars in two TV shows (Winner of Redneck Island on CMT and his very own hunting show on DirtRoadTV), thousands of social media fans/followers, and has played across the southeast for the last 5 years to hordes of music lovers singing the words of his Alabama anthem (“Bury Me In Dixie”) back to him. People don’t even realize Riley’s an accomplished musician when meeting him. He’s not inclined to brag or talk about himself. \r\n\r\nRiley was born into songwriting and performing; spending days and nights with his grandfather, Bufford Green. “My PawPaw opened a music hall in 2003, where he’d always say music goes from ‘The Bar Room to The Pulpit and Back’ each Friday Night. My Granddaddy Buford taught me a love for the sound of old traditional country, bluegrass, and southern gospel music,” explains Riley. The youngster performed at the Golden Saw Music Hall, singing songs like “Wreck on the Highway” and “Precious Jewel” by Roy Acuff with his grandfather and other men of his generation. “My Best Friend” was written as a tribute to his Granddaddy Bufford and the influence he had on Riley’s life & music. “Line in the Water” was inspired by fishing trips with his other grandfather, Granddaddy Lendon, who left a mark on the southern boy by showing him how to truly relax and enjoy the southern lifestyle.\r\n\r\nOutside of music, Riley always found time for athletics. Riley, a three sport athlete in high school and a walk-on quarterback at Jacksonville State University understands the importance that comes from playing sports and being part of a team. \r\n\r\nMany of Riley’s next generation of songs reflect on the experiences of a young southern man trying to find his place in the world. With a mixture of outlaw-rebellion and respect for tradition, Riley combined these values to create his own style. “’A Little Hank’ and ‘Almost’ reflect the battle of values and what my grandfather referred to as ‘the fine line between Saturday night and Sunday morning,’” he explains. Green’s latest EP titled “County Line” which was released earlier this year and reached #14 on the iTunes Country Chart. He has also been recognized by BuzzFeed and Whiskey Riff as an up-and-comer to keep an eye on.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, Riley Green is still that Alabama boy grounded in the values instilled by generations of southern gentlemen. The outdoors man (who is more than likely to address you by Sir or Mam) remains true to himself whether he’s headlining his annual homecoming show (Back 40 Bash) in front of thousands of fans or tending his deer plots as his golden Labrador (Sadie) follows close behind. This is only the beginning for the next country music star from Dixie!

The disbanding of Destiny\'s Child in 2005 facilitated her continued success: her sophomore solo album B\'Day, released in 2006, debuted at number one on the Billboard charts. Her third solo album, I Am… Sasha Fierce, was released in November 2008, and in 2009 she received 10 Grammy Awards nominations. On January 31, 2010, she won 6 Grammy Awards, breaking the record for most Grammy awards won by a female artist in one night; she previously held the record of five awards with 5 other artists.

The track, \"Die With You\" is a stripped down ballad, with Beyoncé sitting at a piano with pigtail braids: the song celebrates the seventh anniversary of her marriage to Jay-Z.\r\n\r\nSuper Bowl - February 2016\r\nBeyoncé appeared on stage to perform her latest single \"Formation\", supporting the headline act Coldplay at the much coverted Super Bowl 50 half-time show on February 7, 2016. Also appearing on stage was Bruno Mars and Mark Ronson who performed their hit \"Uptown Funk\".\r\n\r\n2016 - 6th Album - \"Lemonade\"\r\n\"Lemonade\" is Beyoncé\'s a sixth solo album and was released on April 23, 2016 as an exclusive on the music streaming service, Tidal after it premiered on the TV Network, HBO, as a conceptual short film.

The album debuted at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100. It became the best-rated album of 2022, named the best album of the year by publications such as the Los Angeles Times, The New York Times, NPR, Pitchfork, and Rolling Stone, which would later place the record at number 71 on their 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list. It then was nominated for Album of The Year at the 65 Annual Grammy Award Show and won Best Dance/Electronic Album.\r\n\r\n2024 - 8th Album - \"COWBOY CARTER\" (ACT ii) \r\n2 years after her seventh studio album, \"RENAISSANCE\", Beyoncé released her eighth studio album \"COWBOY CARTER\" also known as “ACT ii” on March 29, 2024. This serves as the second installment of the three-part project, and as long rumoured, its genre is country. The album was teased through a Verizon ad aired during the Super Bowl LVIII and was preceded with two surprise singles both released on February 10, 2024, \"TEXAS HOLD \'EM\"  which hit #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and \"16 CARRIAGES\". The album broke several streaming records and debuted at number one in several countries globally.  \"TEXAS HOLD \'EM\" became the first country song by a black woman to top the Billboard Hot 100 and Hot Country Songs charts, respectively. COWBOY CARTER was met with universal acclaim upon release; critics felt that the album\'s genre experimentation, expansive scope and eclectic references aided an ambitious reimagining of Americana and country through the lens of its black roots. The album also ignited discussions on Black musicians\' place within country music, boosted the listenership of Black country artists and country radio in general, and increased the popularity of Western wear and culture.\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous\r\nBeyoncé began her acting career in 2001, appearing in the musical film Carmen: A Hip Hopera.

This led to him flying O\'Connor out the following year to Los Angeles to collaborate on his album Flower Boy, with him co-writing and contributing vocals to the songs \"Boredom\" and \"Foreword\". On 17 November 2016, O\'Connor released the single \"UNO\", a song Clash magazine described by writing, \"The buoyant keyboard riff underpins a hypnotic half-spoken vocal, one that veers from topic to topic in a hazy burst of creative mania.\" On 25 January 2017, he released the single “Best Friend” (premiering on Apple Music\'s Beats 1 station), followed later in the year by the release of his second album Apricot Princess. His work was compared by Aimee Cliff of The Fader in 2017 to \"other artsy, post-genre teen artists, such as Kevin Abstract or Steve Lacy\".\r\n\r\nO\'Connor\'s first release following the success of Apricot Princess and Flower Boy was on 11 October 2017 with the single \"Loving Is Easy\", created in collaboration with the Dutch artist Benny Sings. On 16 April 2018, he performed the song in his television debut on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. On 31 May 2018, he released a cover of \"You\'ve Got a Friend in Me\" in collaboration with Randy Newman, the creator of the song. He was also featured in Spotify\'s Rise Program.\r\n\r\nOn 9 October 2018, O\'Connor was scheduled to appear on the French television program Quotidien, but refused to perform because it featured a sketch by comedian Alison Wheeler parodying the Ku Klux Klan, which he called \"tasteless\".\r\n\r\nOn 14 February 2019, O\'Connor released the single \"New House\". Later that year on 12 September, he released \"10/10\"; the lead single from his third album Pony. Released on 25 October 2019, Pony was his first major-label album released through RCA Records.\r\n\r\nOn 30 September 2020, O\'Connor released an EP with recordings from his performance at Radio City Music Hall in New York City during his Pony tour titled Live at Radio City Music Hall alongside a documentary released on YouTube. This documentary showed the events leading up to this performance as well as the early conclusion of the Pony tour due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\r\n\r\nIn October 2020, O\'Connor confirmed that he was in the process of recording a fourth studio album titled Who Cares? In January 2021, he liked a Tweet seemingly confirming that it would be released at some point later that year. However, this did not materialize. On 13 January 2022, he began officially teasing the album, sending out postcards containing a phone number that when called, a snippet of the song would play. The album was released on 11 March 2022, and was his first to top the UK Albums Chart, entering ahead of Impera by Ghost.\r\n\r\nGrowing up, O\'Connor listened to Queen, ABBA, Stevie Wonder, and American alternative artists like Weezer and Green Day. He cites these artists and others as core inspirations for his own music. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Rex+Orange+County\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

A country artist from Paradise, California.\r\n2. A jazz drummer, composer, bandleader and producer.\r\n\r\nAccording to an age-old cliché, getting knocked down ain’t what matters – it’s how you get up, and Sony Music Nashville’s Nate Smith knows firsthand. With a personal journey scarred by disaster, but defined by revival, he could have stayed down multiple times through life, and instead grew into something else entirely: A beacon of country-music hope.\r\n\r\nFeaturing a mix of gritty backwoods soul, rock ‘n’ roll swagger and velvet-thunder vocals, Smith is a Nashville artist with a unique connection to life’s inner tug of war. And with his first batch of major-label music, he’s aiming to tip the scales once and for all.\r\n\r\n“I just feel lucky that I get to be the messenger for these songs,” says the rising singer-songwriter. “I’m not here to be cool or anything like that. It’s literally just to hit people in the heart.”\r\n\r\nA California native and lifelong music lover, Smith approaches that mission with a background as eclectic as it gets. Learning guitar at 13, Garth Brooks, Elvis Presley and Bob Seger were among those informing his powerful, fire-from-within vocals, while Michael Jackson made him crave the spotlight and Nirvana gave his sound a jagged edge.\r\n\r\nThe young artist combined it all as a gifted worship leader, and first chased his neon dreams to Nashville in his early 20s – but it didn’t stick. The disheartened Smith returned home and thought he was “100 percent done” with his artistic journey… until a crucible of change burned away the past.\r\n\r\nIn 2018, Smith lost everything he owned in the devastating Camp Fire which tore through Paradise, California, now known as the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in the state’s history. Although his family was safe, he struggled to cope and turned back to music for comfort, using a loaned guitar to co-write a song called “One of These Days.” “It was just to help me process, I guess,” Smith says. “And then hopefully help other people, too.”\r\n\r\nHelp it did. Caught between bittersweet nostalgia and his rock-solid belief the community would rebuild, the song embodied everything Smith was feeling – and everything he loved about music. Going viral online, it led to local TV appearances, recovery benefit concerts and finally an opening slot at a Sacramento arena show by Pitbull and X Ambassadors, before Smith finally understood what was happening.\r\n\r\n“It made me go ‘My gosh, this song is really helping people, I think I want to do more of that,’” he explains. “[The fire] was a horrible thing to happen. But it did move me into a place to start doing what I think I’m supposed to be doing.”\r\n\r\nAfter returning to Nashville, the singer-songwriter is now unveiling a new round of music which puts that inspirational mission front-and-center – and features an edgy-organic sound unlike anything else in the format.\r\n\r\nRecorded at the world famous Blackbird Studios with producers Lindsay Rimes and Joel Bruyere, tracks like “Wildfire” and “Under My Skin” started a new chapter, mixing timeless country soul with a touch of ‘70s-rock toughness, a sweet-and-sour sound with deeper implications.\r\n\r\n“My songs have a little bit of melancholy to them – but there’s an element of hope mixed in,” Smith admits. “I want to emote that, and the passion behind what I have experienced, and I hope that’s a voice for somebody else. I want people to feel it inside, and that’s why I like country music so much. The heartfelt level of what we can do.”\r\n\r\nTracks like “Raised Up” take the idea a step farther. Co-written by Smith with Trannie Anderson and Johnathan Smith, the emotional tune is a raspy power ballad about overcoming obstacles, built on epic vocal power and the hidden strength within each person.\r\n\r\n“The day we wrote it, I had to leave the room because I was tearing up,” Smith says. “The song talks about ‘Any time I lose my way, I turn the way I was raised up,’ and for me, whenever I’m lost or feeling alone, I’ve got God.’ That has really helped me, but it can be whatever somebody needs. It could be thinking about something your grandma said one time you now hold on to, or the phrase you have tattooed on your arm. It’s however you find your way back home. I’m all for that.”\r\n\r\nElsewhere, Smith practices romantic honor with the sexy soul-rocker, “You Shouldn’t Have To,” his voice as craggy as a mountain and ideals just as lofty. That force-of-nature vocal is matched by a hurricane of awestruck attraction in “Name Storms After,” and tunes like “Sleeve” use a Fleetwood Mac-vibe to tribute those like Smith, who wear their hearts on the outside.\r\n\r\nBut with “World War Me,” all of Smith’s authenticity, resilience and optimism combine for an introspective country masterpiece. Featuring a stormy sonic soundscape, battle-hardened wordplay and all the wounded soul his voice can muster, the song speaks to Smith’s decade-long battle with anxiety – and his drive to be an example for others.\r\n\r\nProving you can achieve your dreams even as you work on yourself, Smith says the song began one particularly bad day, when “That dark voice of ‘You’re not good enough’ was really there.”\r\n\r\n“I was just accepting it, but then as I was driving to a co-write, I was like ‘Nah. I don’t accept that. I am supposed to be here and I am worthy,’” Smith says. “I stood up against the dark thoughts, and it was like ‘That felt good. Why am I letting these take over my life?’”\r\n\r\nSmith has been standing up like that ever since, and it’s led him to the batch of music he was born to create. Tested by wildfire and challenged by inner demons, he refused to stay knocked down, and something else won out.\r\n\r\n“If I could sum everything up in one word, it’s hope,” he says. “We all go through things, we really do. But I truly believe the world is trying to bend in your best interest. I really believe that with my whole heart.” <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Nate+Smith\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Proudly hailing from northeast Texas, he has quietly asserted himself as the ultimate country rockstar, bulldozing the boundaries between Nashville songcraft, rowdy Texas spirit, and rain-swept Seattle hard rock. After moving 1 million units under the radar and popping off as one of the hottest live performers in the game, he welcomes everyone to the party on his 2022 full-length offering, Hell Paso (Columbia Records).\r\n\r\n\"I did what I wanted to do,\" he exclaims. \"This was straight up me. Nobody told me to do this record. We pulled in every genre we were feeling at the time. We spent the last ten years trying to make this sound -- Hell Paso is it.\"\r\n\r\nNever compromising, Koe might just be the last real rebel out there. The gold-selling singer, songwriter, guitarist, and producer shakes up the status quo, shatters expectations, and sticks to his guns with a sound steeped in country storytelling, yet spiked with grunge grit. He\'s unapologetic, undeniable, and unlike anyone else you\'ve ever heard. Without anything to prove and nothing to lose, he continues to kick ass on his own terms. Breaking through with a series of independent releases and tallying over 1.3 BILLION streams to date, he has impressively notched three RIAA Gold-certified singles, including \"February 28, 2016,\" \"Something To Talk About,\" and \"Drunk Driving.\" The latter adorned his 2020 Columbia Records debut, Sellout, which arrived to widespread critical acclaim from American Songwriter, Billboard, The Boot, Rolling Stone, and more. At the same time, he has quietly emerged as a powerhouse performer. He graced Pollstar\'s \"Top Worldwide Tours\" back-to-back in 2020 and 2021, moving hundreds of thousands of tickets in the process. In addition to headlining his own Koe Wetzel\'s Incredible Music Festival, he has packed arenas, amphitheaters, and ballparks across North America, attracting a devout audience.\r\n\r\nAt the top of 2022, Koe and longtime collaborator Taylor Kimball retreated to Sonic Ranch Recording Studio -- a stone\'s throw away from the Mexican border just outside of El Paso, Texas. Holed up on a pecan farm for a month, they had nothing to do \"except eat wonderful Mexican food and fucking play music.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was straight-up bliss, man,\" he says. \"I couldn\'t go to the bar because there isn\'t one. I just had to make music!\"\r\n\r\nFittingly, he set the stage for Hell Paso with \"April Showers.\" Powered by a galloping riff awash in distortion, it culminates on one of his most chantable choruses. \"It gives you a taste of the entire record,\" he adds. \"It was a good song for everyone to jump into.\"\r\n\r\nOn its heels, the single \"Creeps\" crawls on grimy guitar towards a sing-song refrain tailormade for stadium-sized crowds -- or karaoke at your favorite old watering hole.\r\n\r\n\"It was a feel-good song for me,\" he says. \"I\'m big into the zombie apocalypse like The Walking Dead, so I wanted an apocalyptic zombie video for this bitch.\"\r\n\r\nPunctuated by nocturnal Spanish guitar and spaghetti western-style whistling, \"Cabo\" recounts a weekend of endless debauchery in Mexico with no shortage of gory details. \"It\'s a million percent true,\" he grins. \"I\'ve pissed off a lot of girlfriends and wives, but other than that it\'s wonderful.\"\r\n\r\nHank Ealy from Turnpike Troubadours lays down tear-drenched pedal steel on \"So Low\" where Koe confesses, \"I\'m so low it\'s fucking awesome. Makes me glad there ain\'t a cure for insane.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was like nothing we\'ve ever done before, so I was like, \'Hell with it, put it on here\',\" he says.\r\n\r\n\"Yellabush Road\" brings him back home with vulnerable verses and another vital hook, \"And I\'m way too blessed to bitch today.\"\r\n\r\n\"\'Yellabush Road\' is my community,\" he goes on. \"It used to be a lot bigger. They had a school, a church, and everything out there. Now, there\'s not even a road sign for it. This is my hometown song though. You get on the road, you get away from everything you know, and you start to miss it. So, the tune puts me back there.\"\r\n\r\nThen there\'s \"Better Without You.\" Guitar wails in between a punch beat as he promises, \"I\'m doing better without you being around.\"\r\n\r\n\"I bought a house a year ago, and I\'ve probably slept in my bed for maybe like two months out of the last year,\" he notes. \"I had to unpack everything in my garage. One of those boxes had all of my ex-girlfriend\'s shit in it. It was raining outside. I was in one of those moods where I was like, \'Fuck this, I\'m going to sit on the couch and grab a guitar.\' You\'re over it, but you\'re not really over it.\"\r\n\r\nThe ride reaches its emotional highpoint on \"Sad Song.\" He concludes the record with a fiery final word.\r\n\r\n\"I just got in the booth and sang,\" he recalls. \"It was all in the moment.\"\r\n\r\nIn the end, there\'s nobody like Koe, and we should be really fucking grateful.\r\n\r\n\"Put out something authentic, it worked. This record is going to get a lot of flack, but it\'s going to get a lot of love too. I\'m not going to stop.

We also learned that the intuition of an artist is so important and it\'s something that needs to be respected because your intuition will differentiate you from others. We learned to write for ourselves and put out songs that will represent who we are.\"\r\n\r\nAnd that\'s exactly what Mau y Ricky did. They followed their intuition after listening to their song \"Arte\" which was almost going to be pitched to Wisin, but Ricky says, \"It didn\'t feel right for another artist to sing this song.\" Another man they have to thank for guiding them since they started composing at a very young age is their father, who has written hit singles like \"La Cima del Cielo,\" \"Déjame Llorar\" and \"Me Va a Extrañar.\"\r\n\r\n\"We\'ve written songs together, so working with him helps you grow a lot because he\'s a very hard critic. Every song I\'ve written since I was 8 years old, I\'d run it by him and he\'d give me feedback. He actually just heard the final product of our album and he loved it, thank God. But the best thing is that he\'s a fan of ours and we\'re huge fans of him. Yeah, he\'s my dad, but I\'m a huge Ricardo Montaner fan.\"\r\n\r\nBesides a new album, Mau y Ricky fans can expect to see them onstage soon as they go out on tour. \"We haven\'t toured in such a long time because we were busy writing for others then started working on this album, but the stage is our natural habitat and where we feel most comfortable.\" <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Mau+y+Ricky\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

She simultaneously echoes the nostalgic bliss of an oceanside afternoon and the anxiety of an uncertain crush set to a soundtrack of lo-fi piano bliss. The lifelong musician developed this sound back in high school. In between classes, she recorded on her phone, edited in Garage Band, and uploaded over 50 songs to Soundcloud, beginning with “Little Houses” during her sophomore year. These early compositions informed her creative DNA. Ultimately, Genevieve’s senior project and a performance video she uploaded via YouTube caught the attention of her management in 2019.

Primarily a pianist, known for his breezy and playful improvisational voicings, Guaraldi cultivated his own innovative brand of jazz music. As primary tunesmith for a number of animated adaptations of the comic strip Peanuts, his influence on young potential jazz listeners was vast. Notably, his soundtrack album to the special of the same name, A Charlie Brown Christmas (1965), is regarded as one of the greatest Christmas albums.\r\n\r\nBorn Vincent Anthony Dellaglio in San Francisco, the \"city by the bay\" would remain Guaraldi\'s base of operations throughout his life, with Guaraldi eventually becoming a significant proponent of west coast jazz. Guaraldi\'s first recorded work was as part of trio with Cal Tjader in 1953. By 1955, Guaraldi had formed his own trio; in contrast to his later, more well-known work, his earlier music was decidedly morose and classically-inspired, as well as lacking drum accompaniment. Moreover, his actual compositional output was vastly outnumbered by cover versions.\r\n\r\nInspired by the 1959 film Black Orpheus, the trio recorded an album featuring renditions of songs from its soundtrack, as well as original compositions inspired by the film; one such original song, \"Cast Your Fate to the Wind\", became an award-winning best seller of its time, peaking at #22 on the Billboard Hot 100. Subsequent vocal versions (with lyrics by Carel Werber) also charted. \"Cast Your Fate...\" also ensured Guaraldi\'s hiring as composer for a number of planned animated adaptations of the world-famous Peanuts comic strip.\r\n\r\nGuaraldi\'s first composition for Peanuts was \"Linus and Lucy\", a theme for the characters of Lucy and Linus van Pelt, which he first played over the phone to producer Lee Mendelson. Featured in the famous \"dancing scene\" from A Charlie Brown Christmas, it has been mistakenly assumed by many to be the \"Peanuts Theme\", when in fact Guaraldi never composed such a theme; the specials tended to have their own individual themes. Regardless, it would become Guaraldi\'s greatest-known work, being among the most recognizable pieces of music in the world.\r\n\r\nA Charlie Brown Christmas, the first proper animated outing for the Peanuts franchise, became an unexpected success upon its first airing, thanks in no small part to Guaraldi\'s timeless score, mixing holiday standards with original tunes with Guaraldi\'s laid-back, acoustic jazz style. One particular song from the album, \"Christmas Time Is Here\", has become a Christmas standard in its own right. It has remained a steady yearly seller for almost five decades, and has never been out of print.\r\n\r\nAs the \'60s began to come to an end, Guaraldi became enamored with electronic sounds and synthesizer devices, in particular the Fender Rhodes brand electric piano, which would color his scores for Peanuts specials as well. Though the recorded output through the duration of his life would  remain lamentably small, Guaraldi continued to play live on a regular basis, more than happy to mix his Peanuts music with jazz standards and contemporary pop music.\r\n\r\nOn February 6, 1976, while between sets at the night spot Butterfield\'s in Menlo Park, Vince Guaraldi died of causes variously attributed to either an aortic aneurysm or a heart attack. The last song he ever performed was a cover version of \"Eleanor Rigby\" by The Beatles. He had completed his underscore for the special It\'s Arbor Day, Charlie Brown that very same day. Music from Peanuts was played over a public announcement system at his funeral.\r\n\r\nMostly owing to the jazz establishment changing its focus towards New York and more experimental forms of jazz, the melodically-minded Guaraldi never gained much recognition from jazz critics and peers of his time. Nevertheless, Guaraldi\'s music grows more and more appreciated with each passing year; historians have observed that scores of musicians and fans alike have attributed their love of jazz to watching, and listening to, Peanuts specials as children. Scores for subsequent Peanuts specials tend to feature at least one Guaraldi original; a testament to his importance to the specials. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Vince+Guaraldi\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

She writes them at home in Richmond, Virginia, letting her subconscious lead stretches on guitar, an open-ended process she likens to dreaming. From a chord progression appears a line, maybe a syllable will start to stick, enough to pursue, but she says sometimes the words don\'t feel like her own, more like shapes that form in the mind’s sky. While many are personal and deal with the emotions that surface with finding her place in the world, she’d prefer they be whatever you’d like them to be, to connect with listeners in their own way. Bollinger’s musical universe is relaxed, tender, and unassuming; within lives a timeless sensibility, a songwriter’s knack for noticing the little things and their counterpoints. Darkness and light, pain and pleasure, reality and escape.\r\n\r\nHer project is collaborative; she shoots music videos with her friends and colors each of her folk-pop songs with musicians in her community. An agile group of players with backgrounds in jazz, they recorded her first EP, I Don’t Wanna Lose, as live takes in a single day, then slowed it down to build out her 2020 EP, A word becomes a sound. Bollinger sings fast at times; she jokes that can get her into trouble when it comes to playing live, “some of these songs are going to be a mouthful.” She’s always been drawn to singers in that free-flowing style and got into the habit of writing quickly while watching her longtime collaborator John Trainum work with rappers in the studio.\r\n\r\nForced to finish her last EP in lockdown, Bollinger, Trainum, and bandmates excitedly returned to sessions in the spring of 2021 to explore a new batch of songs, now beginning to surface at summer’s end. In August, she shared “Shadows,” an introspective psych-pop lullaby characterized by languid melodies, pointed lyrics, and an air of mischief — all on display in the single’s surreal music video directed by her childhood friend, Kia Wassenaar. Paste Magazine called the single “warm, dynamic, and inviting.”\r\n\r\nWith a tour underway supporting Real Estate and dates with Faye Webster slated for spring 2022, Bollinger lets the next one fly alongside the announcement of her first-ever label signing. From a forthcoming collection on Ghostly International, “Yards / Gardens” finds Bollinger in full swing, skipping verses of uncertainty above a bright and nimble bassline and kick. Guitarist Chris Lewis weaves throughout, his riffs unravel across the bridge, trailing her lines like ellipses. Written with Trainum and Lewis in their shared month-to-month storage space, “Yards / Gardens” reflects “feeling resistant to change, during a time when it felt like everything was changing,” says Bollinger. Growing up has become a motif in her work, but she’s never sidestepped the concept in quite this way. Here, self-assured and surrounded by vivid production, she leans back in the grass, letting expectations breeze by, reminding herself she’ll tend to things in good time (“I’m viewing days like practice rounds / come next year, I’ll know what to do”). <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Kate+Bollinger\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

She began watching videos on the small screen of said handheld game console, and was impressed by the cover singers on Niconico who sang without showing their faces. In 2017, she began singing as an utaite on Niconico after uploading a video of herself singing a cover of \"Kimi no taion\" (Your Heat) on January 10, 2017.\r\n\r\nIn 2020, at the age of 17, she made her debut with the digital single titled Usseewa.

She has been an Utaite (mostly anonymous cover artists) and a fan of Hatsune Miku and other Vocaloids throughout her life which could be assumed to be a reason why alongside simple privacy reasons. \r\n\r\n2022 is regarded as a very significant year in her career. She released her first two Albums: Kyougen (January 2022) and the album dedicated to One Piece: Film Red (August 2022 / More info down below), getting to create two theme songs for the Live Action Movie, \"Karada Sagashi\" as well as having live performances and other collaborations and events throughout the year. \r\n\r\nIn the Summer of 2022, She played a major role in the movie One Piece: Film Red for the very popular anime series One Piece as she released an album dedicated to the movie.

Cole. Videos to both remixes were uploaded to the WorldStarHipHop\'s YouTube channel, which led to an immense and immediate positive response from both mainstream media and the online rap community. His debut studio album, The Lost Boy was released on July 26, 2019 and received a nomination for Best Rap Album at the 62nd Grammy Awards. Cordae was a member of the YBN collective from 2018 until the group disbanded in 2020.\r\n\r\nDunston was born in Raleigh, North Carolina, but moved to Suitland, Maryland. As a young child, he\'d taken an interest in music as his father would always play classic hip hop around him, from artists such as Rakim, Nas, Big L, and Talib Kweli. He began writing raps around the age of fifteen, but did not take it seriously, as it was only a hobby for him. Following the influence he gained from the music his father listened to, he would do research on certain artists through YouTube, attempting to find similar music and \"getting lost\" in the recommended videos section. Dunston began gaining more interest in pursuing a rap career as he aged, but focused on his education first, although writing lyrics often distracted him from his studies. He released three mixtapes as a teenager under the name \"Entendre\" – Anxiety (2014), I’m So Anxious (2016), and I’m So Anonymous (2017). He graduated from high school in 2015 and decided to go to college at Towson University, later dropping out in 2018, explaining that college was \"bigger than him\" as a first-generation student, and he was mainly doing it for his mother.

Although he hadn\'t been releasing any music with them, he\'d often hang around YBN Nahmir and Almighty Jay when visiting Los Angeles, whom he\'d initially met through social media. Nahmir had taken interest in a song that Dunston had made with fellow rapper and brother Simba, and reached out to him. Dunston is the only member of YBN that hadn\'t been introduced to everyone as a gamer, as he doesn\'t take gaming too seriously. He already felt like he was a part of YBN, the only thing that hadn\'t solidified his presence being his social media handles, which he soon changed from Entendre to YBN Cordae. He also stated that Entendre had been a name that he\'d wanted to change for while, stating \"I was just always around Nahmir and shit, those were just like my brothers... And, I was thinking, yo, I need to change my shit to like, Cordae, and shit, my actual first name. I was already \"YBN\" without the social tag, you know what I\'m saying?\" He released his first single, which he called his \"introduction to the world\", in May 2018. It was a remix of the 1999 song \"My Name Is\" by Eminem, which he released along with a music video via WorldStarHipHop on YouTube. Subsequently, he released \"Old N***as\", as a response to \"1985\" by J. Cole, then released the tracks Fighting Temptations and Kung Fu, respectively.\r\n\r\nHis debut live performance was at the annual Rolling Loud music festival in May 2018, in which he performed with both YBN Nahmir and Almighty Jay.

Dunston was then announced to be joining Juice WRLD on his North American WRLD Domination tour from May to September 2018, along with Lil Mosey and  Blake, ended up reaching 28 cities. Soon after, it was announced that YBN would be going on a month-long tour in Europe as a collective. Dunston then said he would release multiple singles up until his debut project is complete. On August 2, 2018, both Nahmir and Cordae released a video for their single \"Pain Away\". On August 12, YBN Nahmir announced that an official YBN Mixtape, featuring the trio, would be released September 7, 2018. He released the music video for his single, \"Scotty Pippen\", on August 23, 2018.\r\n\r\nOn January 28, 2019, Cordae released a music video for a new song titled, \"Locationships\" on his YouTube channel before releasing another song titled, \"Have Mercy\" in March 2019, with the latter song becoming the lead single from his debut studio album, The Lost Boy. He was later named as one of the members of XXL\'s \"2019 Freshman Class\" on June 20, 2019.[26] Cordae later released \"Bad Idea\" and \"RNP\" as the second and third singles from the album respectively. The Lost Boy was released on July 26, 2019. The album landed YBN Cordae two nominations at the 62nd Grammy Awards; Best Rap Album and Best Rap Song for the single \"Bad Idea\".

In 2003, friends introduced Rihanna and her two bandmates to record producer Evan Rogers, who was vacationing in Barbados with his wife.  The group auditioned for Rogers, who said that \"the minute Rihanna walked into the room, it was like the other two girls didn\'t exist.\"   While auditioning for Rogers, Rihanna sang Destiny\'s Child\'s cover of \"Emotion\".  Over the next year, Rihanna and her mom shuttled back and forth to Rogers home in Stamford, Connecticut. Then, shortly after turning 16, she relocated in the United States and moved in with Rogers and his wife.  Carl Sturken helped Rihanna record a four-song demo, which included the ballad \"The Last Time,\" a cover of Whitney Houston’s hit \"For the Love of You\" and what would become her first hit, \"Pon de Replay\" to send to various recording companies.  It took a year to record the demos, because she was going to school and would only record during summer and Christmas school breaks. Rihanna\'s demo made its way to Def Jam, which invited her to audition for the label\'s then-president, Jay-Z, who quickly signed her.\r\n\r\nRihanna broke into the recording industry in 2005 with the release of her debut album Music of the Sun, which features the number 2 hit single \"Pon de Replay\".  Less than a year later, Rihanna released album artist=Rihanna]A Girl Like Me and earned her first number-one single, \"SOS, which sampled the popular 80s track \"Tainted Love\".  \"Unfaithful\" was also released and was fairly successful.\r\n\r\nRihanna released her third album Good Girl Gone Bad in June 2007. Prior to the release of the album, she spent the week of the Grammys writing songs for the album with Ne-Yo.  She adopted a more sexual image while recording the album, eventually dying her hair black and cutting it short. Rihanna worked with Timbaland and Christopher \"Tricky\" Stewart, as well as previous musical collaborators such as Stargate, Carl Sturken and Evan Rogers to re-imagine her album compositions with uptempo dance tracks. Rihanna commented, \"I want to keep people dancing but still be soulful at the same time.  You feel different every album, and [at] this stage I feel like I want to do a lot of uptempo [songs].\"\r\n\r\nThe album topped the charts in countries like the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Brazil, Russia and Ireland, and peaked at number two in the United States and Australia.  Unlike previous work, the album featured a more dance-pop sound instead of the dancehall, reggae and ballad styles. The album received positive reviews by critics, becoming her most critically acclaimed album at that time compared to her previous efforts.\r\n\r\nIt yielded eight hit singles - \"Umbrella\"  \"Shut Up and Drive\", \"Don\'t Stop The Music\" \"Hate That I Love You\" \"Rehab\" \"Disturbia\" \"Take A Bow\" \"If I Never See Your Face Again\" - all singles reaching the top twenty on the Billboard Hot 100 — including the worldwide number-one hit \"Umbrella,\" featuring Jay-Z.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to reaching number one in various countries, \"Umbrella\" was the number one single in the United Kingdom for ten consecutive weeks, making it the longest-running number-one single since Wet Wet Wet\'s single \"Love Is All Around\" spent fifteen weeks at the top in 1994.  The song is listed number three on the 100 Best Songs of 2007 published by Rolling Stone magazine.  In 2008, \"Umbrella\" earned Rihanna and Jay-Z a Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration in addition to receiving nominations for Record of the Year and Song of the Year. It managed to stay at number one in the United Kingdom for 10 weeks, the longest time spent by a female and in the 21st century, on this chart.\r\n\r\n\"Umbrella\" has also been recognised in various forms of accolades by the music press.

Blender magazine awarded the song Song of the Year in their Readers\' Poll 2007. The music press has considered \"Umbrella\" as 2007\'s Song of the Summer,  while The New York Times writer Kelefa Sanneh regarded it as \"arguably 2007\'s signature slow jam\".\r\n\r\nIn August 2009, Rihanna collaborated with Jay-Z and Kanye West on \"Run This Town.\" The song peaked at number two on Billboard Hot 100 and also reached the top ten in five other countries. She appeared on the cover of Vogue Italia for the September 2009 Issue.  The shoot was influenced by Rihanna\'s hair, which she had cut for the shoot into a mohawk-like style. The style of the shoot was Extreme Couture and very dark, and in one shot she appeared semi-nude.  Rihanna performed \"Run This Town\" along with Jay-Z and West for the \"Answer the Call\" concert at Madison Square Garden in September 2009, making it her first musical performance since the altercation with Brown.

The album\'s lead single, \"Russian Roulette\" -- written with Ne-Yo - was one of the year\'s most controversial singles. The album also includes collaborations with Tricky, The-Dream, Stargate, and SRP.\r\n\r\nOne year later, Rihanna released her fifth studio album called Loud. It\'s lead single, \"Only Girl (In the World)\", reached number one in more than ten countries. The song also won a Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording.\r\n\r\nTalk That Talk was released one year after Loud. With the song \"We Found Love\", Rihanna became the fastest solo artist in the chart\'s history to achieve twenty Hot 100 top-ten singles, breaking the previous record set by Madonna. The song later became her eleventh number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100. \"You Da One\" became the second single from the album but was not as successful as \"We Found Love\". The third single from the album, \"Talk That Talk\" featuring Jay-Z, was announced on Rihanna\'s Twitter.

They play an eccentric mix of rock, punk, funk and jazz. The band achieved great commercial success in 2006 with their album Radwimps 4: Okazu no Gohan, and are best known for their later singles \"Order Made\" (2008) and \"Dada\" (2011), both of which hit number one on Oricon\'s single charts.\r\n\r\nThe five original members had been friends since middle school. Vocalist Yojiro Noda first became interested in music after hearing Oasis in middle school, when he would try to remember the guitar chords and sing to Oasis songs. He was asked to become the vocalist by a friend, and originally band activities were balanced with basketball. The band\'s name was formed from two English language slang terms, rad and wimp. According to the band, the coined word had several meanings, including \"excellent weakling\" and \"superlative coward.\"\r\n\r\nThe band\'s activities began centred around Yokohama, with the band performing their first live at live house BB Street in Yokohama\'s Kannai district on February 5, 2002. At this point, guitarist Akira Kuwahara dropped out of high school in order to focus on the band. In September and August 2002, the band partook in the Yokohama High School Music Festival, and eventually won the grand prize for the competition with the song \"Moshi mo.\" \"Moshi mo\" was released as the band\'s debut single in May 2003, with 10,000 copies pressed and sold for 100 yen each. Following this single, the band toured the Yokohama area, including a performance as the sole act at Yokohama\'s Club 24West. The band released their debut album Radwimps in July through independent label Newtraxx, featuring songs written by the band in middle school. The following August, after a guest appearance at the Yokohama High School Music Festival, the band went on hiatus for Noda and other members to focus on their school exams.\r\n\r\nRadwimps returned from hiatus in March 2004, however members Kei Asō, Yūsuke Saiki and Akio Shibafumi did not decide to resume band activities. An audition was not held for new members, instead, acquaintances to the band members, drummer Satoshi Yamaguchi and bassist Yusuke Takeda, were added to the group without the members even having their skills trialled. Takeda met the band members in August 2003 as a member of a different band performing in the Yokohama High School Music Festival. The band immediately began recording songs, and by July released a second single, \"Kiseki,\" and performed a three month Japan-wide tour. Immediately after the end of the tour, the band started work on their second album, Radwimps 2: Hatten Tojō, which was finalized by the end of the year and released in March.\r\n\r\nDirectly after the release, the band departed on a five month tour, Radwimps Haruna Tour (はるなっTOUR?), and also performed at high profile summer music festivals, such as Setstock, Rock in Japan and Summer Sonic. During this time, the band released a third single, \"Hexun / Kanashi,\" which was the band\'s first charting release.\r\n\r\nIn November, the band made their major debut single under Toshiba EMI with the single \"Nijūgoko-me no Senshokutai,\" followed by \"EDP (Tonde Hi ni Iru Natsu no Kimi)\" in January, both top 50 singles. In shifting to a major label, Noda explained that the band took the same stance as they had as an independent band, and that \"If we thought we were bigger on a major label, that would have been a big mistake.\" The band\'s third and first major label album, Radwimps 3: Mujintō ni Motte Ikiwasureta Ichimai in March 2006, was a landmark in establishing their popularity, debuting at number 13 on Oricon\'s album charts. Radwimps 3 saw a change in the band\'s musical style, allowing the band to be more experimental in their sound.\r\n\r\nBy the end of 2006 the band\'s popularity had exponentially grown: the band\'s album Radwimps 4: Okazu no Gohan, lead with the top 20 singles \"Futarigoto\" and \"Yūshinron\" and top five \"Setsuna Rensa,\" debuted at number five and had an initial shipment of more than 100,000 copies. In this time, the band\'s older releases, such as Radwimps, Radwimps 2 and \"Kiseki\" began charting for the first time and continued to for extended periods, Radwimps even eventually being certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of Japan. In the next three years, both Radwimps and Radwimps 2 charted for approximately 100 weeks, and as of early 2011, Radwimps 3 and Radwimps 4 still continue to chart.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, the band received their first number one single, with \"Order Made\", on the Oricon charts. Their 2009 album Altocolony no Teiri sold around 213,000 copies in its first week, debuting at number 2 on the Oricon charts. The band received their second Oricon number one single \"Dada\" in 2011.\r\n\r\nThe band gained renewed notoriety in 2016 when they provided the soundtrack for the Makoto Shinkai film \"Kimi no Na wa. (Your Name.)\", which went on to become the highest-grossing anime film in history. One of the four vocal tracks, \"Zenzenzense\", was a #1 hit in Japan.

The duo released its official debut single, \"#Selfie,\" which celebrated and skewered 2010s narcissism, in January 2014. The track\'s bouncy beats and self-obsessed words hit number one on the Billboard dance chart and sold over ten million copies. Meanwhile, \"#Selfie\"\'s video featured cameos by Snoop Dogg and David Hasselhoff, fueling the song\'s viral popularity to hundreds of millions of views. More singles, including \"Kanye\" and \"Let You Go,\" followed.\r\n\r\nIn 2015, they issued the Bouquet EP on Disruptor Records, a softer and more indie-flavored effort that featured the single \"Roses,\" which was certified double-platinum and hit number one on the Top Dance Songs chart. The song also earned the Chainsmokers nominations for the Billboard Music Awards in the Top Dance/Electronic Artist and Top Dance/Electronic Song categories. After playing over 300 shows in 2015, including dates at festivals like Lollapalooza, Firefly, Tomorrowland, and Ultra, the duo returned in 2016 with the platinum-certified \"Don\'t Let Me Down,\" a collaboration with Pittsburgh pop singer Daya that topped the Billboard dance chart and would later win a Grammy. That year, the Chainsmokers also performed as part of the Tilt Tour, the first ever fan-sourced tour. In addition, Pall and Taggart host two SiriusXM shows: Nice Hair, a monthly mix; and the weekly YouTube EDM 15.\r\n\r\nThe follow-up single to \"Don\'t Let Me Down\" would carry the duo to new heights. Featuring Halsey on vocals, \"Closer\" began its slow climb to the top of the singles chart in the summer of 2016. Once it hit number one, it remained in the top spot for over ten weeks, breaking the record previously held by Drake\'s \"One Dance.\" As their chart dominance continued, they released the Collage EP, which joined their two Top Three singles with new collaborations featuring Phoebe Ryan, XYLØ, and Charlee. Their debut record, Memories: Do Not Open, arrived in 2017. Featuring guests Emily Warren, Jhene Aiko, Florida Georgia Line, and hit singles \"Paris\" and the Coldplay collaboration \"Something Just Like This,\" Memories debuted at the top of the Billboard chart. At the start of 2018, the pair veered in a more contemplative and lyrical direction with the single \"Sick Boy,\" which landed on the EP of the same name. Sick Boy debuted on the Billboard 200 just outside the Top 50. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Chainsmokers\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Having caught the public\'s attention in 2010 with her singles \"Starry Eyed\" and \"Guns and Horses,\" British vocalist Ellie Goulding quickly rose to the top of the charts with her infectious electronic pop sound. Although she started out writing songs in a folk-inflected style, she eventually grew into a more electronic-influenced artist, touching upon dance music and ambient synth pop. With her unique soprano warble and knack for writing catchy yet emotionally earnest songs, Goulding, much like her predecessors Kate Bush and Imogen Heap, stands at the forefront of contemporary mainstream music and arty, independent-minded pop.\r\n\r\nBorn in Hereford, England, she later moved to the country\'s east coast to study drama at the University of Kent. Goulding had developed a love for folk music as a teenager, and her time at university also exposed her to electronica. After two years, she took a break from her studies and moved to West London, where she pursued a career as an alternative singer/songwriter and befriended producers like Starsmith and Frankmusik, who gave her songs an electro-pop twist. In 2009, Goulding began building an audience via the Internet, where early tracks like \"Starry Eyed\" and a cover of Sam Sparro\'s \"Black & Gold\" were posted on tastemaking MP3 blogs such as Discodust. Goulding soon graduated from the blogosphere to print media, gaining praise from mainstream publications like The Guardian and fielding offers from record labels. She ultimately signed a major-label deal with Polydor Records and began making preparations to release her debut album. In the meantime, she penned songs for Diana Vickers, Gabriella Climi, and others.\r\n\r\nDuring the final weeks of 2009, Goulding topped the BBC\'s Sound of 2010, a poll conducted by British music critics and industry insiders to identify new talent. Building on that momentum, she released Lights -- a sparkling debut album that splashed Goulding\'s vocal flutter across a landscape of acoustic and synthesized instruments -- in March 2010. Lights topped the U.K. charts during its first week and spun off \"Starry Eyed\" as a Top Five single (it also charted well in Ireland and New Zealand). Later that year, the album was re-released as Bright Lights, featuring seven new recordings (including a cover of Elton John\'s \"Your Song,\" which peaked at number two).\r\n\r\nIn 2012, Goulding returned with her sophomore album, Halcyon, which showcased an even more sonically adventurous, electro-pop-infused sound. In 2013, a deluxe reissue featuring ten extra songs was released; entitled Halcyon Days, it acted as a supplement to the original release. Two of its new songs, \"Burn\" and \"How Long Will I Love You,\" were among her biggest hits. The following year, she was featured on Calvin Harris\' Top Ten U.K. hit \"Outside,\" participated in Band Aid 30\'s update of \"Do They Know It\'s Christmas?,\" and entered the U.K. Top Ten once more with \"Beating Heart,\" a song released on the soundtrack for Divergent. Another soundtrack single, \"Love Me Like You Do,\" added to the success of Fifty Shades of Grey in 2015.\r\n\r\nThat same year, Goulding released her third studio album, Delirium, which featured collaborations with Max Martin, Greg Kurstin, and others.

I play the guitar and I play the bass and piano and then I\'m singing a lot of vocals. It\'s very classically influenced because I love classical music. There\'s a lot going on, it\'s a big soundscape and one big film. The second half is my kind of alter ego songs.\"[121] On 21 May she released single \"Power\" and on 30 June single \"Slow Grenade\" with Lauv.\r\n\r\nGoulding released her fourth studio album, Brightest Blue, on 17 July 2020.

They\'ve seen a lot of controversy via TikTok, X and Instagram since 2023 when a clip of the song “I would hate me too\" went fairly viral, which got the attention of record label Hopeless records. TX2 signed to Hopeless in July of 2023 and has 12 singles and 1 EPs out under the label. They’re also still under fire for their song “Randy McNally (No Love Like Christian Hate)”, which is openly against Christian homophobia and involvement in the American Government. More recently, the band Ice Nine Kills got dragged into the hate for touring and releasing the song “MAD” with them. Similarly, Andy Biersack of Black Veil Brides has been attacked for defending TX2 on X. Most of their controversies surround Thomas using rage bait to get views, being a “poser”, and being the forefront of the band. They’ve also been under fire for supposedly stealing music from band Get Scared, which is false, and using a TikTok as part of the song “Vendetta (ft Johnny 3 Tears)”, which also isn’t true, the audio in the song was voiced by the guitarists sister. The original audio was from a TikTok and said “If I have to hear TX2 talk about ‘goth dommy mommies’ one more time, I’ll shoot myself” in regards to his satire content. The audio was referenced in the song along with the lyrics “do it”, which many people found distasteful. In a video about this, Thomas misgendered the TikToker multiple times, but corrected himself from then on once finding out their pronouns. The video itself is about Thomas making jokes about fetishizing “goth dommy mommies”, which he seems to have stopped months ago.\r\nThe band has been very vocal about LGBTQ representation and being allies and a part of the community, playing at protests and speaking about LGBTQ rights at their shows. They also use their YouTube and TikTok platform to spread this message, along with their support of mental health and the like. \r\nThe other members of the band are:\r\nGuitarist and backup vocals - Cameron “Cam” Rostami @superblood_cam), Thomas’ best friend and roommate, he also has his own music under the name “Superblood”.\r\nBass player - Courtney “Corky” Howard (@corky_lee_), the most recent addition to the band. She has her own music under the name “Corky”.\r\nAnd on Drums - Sam Palombo (@sampalombo). He’s been under accusations of his own, based around him supposedly constantly being on drugs because of how he moves and acts. Thomas spoke out about this on X, saying “People have accused my drummer of being on drugs for the way he acts and moves. Homie is just autistic. Chill lmao”\r\nSome of their most popular songs include “Randy McNally (No Love Like Christian Hate)”, “Vampire by Rumor”, “MAD (ft Ice Nine Kills)”, and “Black Wedding”.\r\nThe songs are mostly written about Thomas’ experiences, past issues, and injustices he “feels he has the right to talk about”. Hits such as “Pull the Plug” and “6 seconds left” are examples of this, both being written about mental health issues. \r\nAfter 10 years of TX2 being formed, Thomas has said \"I have finally found my band members who care for me, and I care for them.\"\r\nTX2 has amassed almost 500k monthly listeners on Spotify, 900k followers via TikTok and 170k followers via Instagram (@tx2offical), as well as a Discord server known as the X Movement as a place for fans to make friends and have a safe space.

He is regarded as one of the world\'s most respected electronic music producers of modern times. In pop culture, he is known for wearing a large \"mau5head\" while performing at live events.\r\n\r\nThe Deadmau5 discography is currently comprised of eight studio albums, eight compilation albums, six mix albums, one soundtrack album, two remix albums, two video albums, seven extended plays, 55 singles, and 22 music videos.\r\n\r\nZimmerman\'s career in music began in 1999, releasing the vinyl pressed single \"I Don\'t Want No Other\" under Dred And Karma. Six years later, Deadmau5 released his debut studio album album, Get Scraped  on July 26, 2005, which featured more experimental genres different from his future sound. Within the following year, Zimmerman finished three compilation albums, Project 56, Deadmau5 Circa 1998–2002, and A Little Oblique, which were released on his (now retired) SectionZ page. \r\n\r\nOn November 6, 2006, he released his second studio album Vexillology, which marked the beginning of the signature Deadmau5 sound. In 2007, Zimmerman founded his own record label, Mau5trap, which released his third studio album Random Album Title on September 2, 2008. This was his first album to garner mainstream success, coining his unique style of progressive house and featuring the singles \"Faxing Berlin\", \"Not Exactly\" and \"I Remember\" (with Kaskade). \r\n\r\nDuring 2008, Zimmerman left Play Records. However, due to his contract agreement, Play Records was able to claim ownership of tracks he made during the time he was signed to the label. This led to the creation of the At Play series, which consisted of six mix albums released periodically from 2008 to 2015. \r\n\r\nOn September 22, 2009, Deadmau5 released his fourth studio album For Lack of a Better Name . In contrast of his previous album, For Lack of a Better Name  is based around tech house. Despite this switch in style, the album contains two of Zimmerman\'s greatest hits to date: \"Ghosts \'n\' Stuff\" and \"Strobe\".  He expanded his EDM sound further with his fifth studio album, 4x4=12 which was released on December 6, 2010, and consisted of techno, electro house and the progressive house/dubstep mashup \"Raise Your Weapon\". In 2011, Deadmau5 released two non-album singles:  \"Aural Psynapse\" and \"HR 8938 Cephei\", with the former being a modern remake of an old song Zimmerman made under the alias Halcyon441.\r\n\r\nZimmerman revisited his roots with his sixth studio album, > Album Title Goes Here <, released on September 21, 2012. The album consists of house music along with songs in the ambient, glitch, and trip-hop genres. In November 2013, Zimmerman deleted three years worth of music from his SoundCloud account, replacing them with 7, an EP of seven melancholy piano sonatas named after the seven deadly sins. The same month, Zimmerman left Ultra Records and signed with record label Astralwerks.\r\n\r\nOn January 7, 2014, Deadmau5 announced on Twitter that his next project was complete. However, it was preceded by the weekly release of four singles, \"Avaritia\", \"Seeya\", \"Infra Turbo Pigcart Racer\" and \"Phantoms Can\'t Hang\" until his seventh studio album While(1<2) was finally released on June 17. After this, Zimmerman would leave Astralwerks and not release any new music until May 27, 2016, with the digital single \"Snowcone\". This song was later included on his eighth studio album W:/2016ALBUM/, which was released on  December 2, 2016.\r\n\r\nIn 2017, Deadmau5 would go on to release a compilation album of his older works, Stuff I Used to Do on January 7, and the single \"Legendary\" on August 25. On March 30, 2018, Zimmerman released Where\'s the Drop?, a compilation album containing orchestral covers of previously released music, with the exception of \"Caritas\", an entirely original song. From July 13, 2018 to February 1, 2019, Deadmau5 released the Mau5ville series, three EPs which featured original work along with remixes and songs by other Mau5trap artists. On January 25, 2019, the movie Polar premiered on Netflix, with Zimmerman releasing the soundtrack album, Polar (Music from the Netflix Film)  the same day. In November, Zimmerman released three new singles, entitled \"Satrn\", \"Coasted\" and \"Fall\", released on the 16th, 22nd and 29th, respectively.\r\n\r\nThe following year, Deadmau5 would continue to release singles, with \"Pomegranate\" on May 20 and \"Bridged By a Lightwave\" on November 10. Both are expected to appear on Zimmerman\'s next studio album. On March 29, 2021, Zimmerman debuted a new, house-focused record label called Hau5trap, and simultaneously released the single \"Nextra\". He would go on to release \"Hypnocurrency\" on April 22 and \"When the Summer Dies\" on July 15.\r\n\r\nThroughout his career, Deadmau5 has won 15 competitive awards and received 42 nominations. Amongst his major achievements, Zimmerman has won five Beatport Music Awards, four DJ Awards, three International Dance Music Awards, three Juno Awards, and has also received six Grammy Award nominations and one World Music Award nomination.\r\n\r\nZimmerman has also worked with a number of artists both underground and mainstream, including Melleefresh, Steve Duda, Kaskade, MC Flipside, Rob Swire of Pendulum,  Chris Lake, Glenn Morrison, Wolfgang Gartner, Sofi, Chris James, Cypress Hill, Imogen Heap, Gerard Way, Colleen D\'Agostino, Grabbitz, Attlas, Shotty Horroh, Lights, Mr. Bill, The Neptunes, Kiesza, and Rezz.\r\n\r\nThe name Deadmau5 originates from an incident where a mouse crawled into his computer and died. He posted this story on an internet forum, and members began calling him TheDeadMouseGuy. \"Dead Mouse\" was too long for an IRC login name, so he abbreviated it to \"deadmau5\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/deadmau5\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

He first acquired a guitar at the age of ten and learned how to play songs by the Red Hot Chili Peppers.\r\n\r\nDuring his childhood, Fike recalled that he and his brothers had to take care of each other owing to his parents\' frequent absence from his life. Throughout his childhood, Fike’s mother was in and out of jail, causing him to stay in different homes, including those of his older brother, relatives, or his parents\' friends. Fike\'s childhood life was \"full of adventure,\" as he and his friends would spend time in a forested area near their neighborhood that they called the \"Forest of Avalon,\" where he said they would eat snacks and smoke cannabis. He and his older brother Sean would also hang out at the guest house of his friend Stefan’s home, called the \"Backhouse,\" where they would freestyle.

They are currently signed to Spirit Goth Records. Vansire has performed at ROCKChester and First Avenue, played a live session with Audiotree, and collaborated with artists such as Chester Watson, Jeremiah Jae, and Mick Jenkins.\r\n\r\nVansire formed as band members Josh Augustin (vocals, synths, guitar, and drums) and Sam Winemiller (bass, guitar, and synths) were attending Century High School in Rochester, Minnesota. Augustin and Winemiller met while playing together on the school\'s drumline and continued to find themselves performing together through school activities (such as concert band and pit orchestra), something the duo says contributed to their creative synergy and friendship, which later helped in Vansire\'s formation.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 2015, Winemiller approached Augustin after practice for the school\'s drumline with an idea to make a band \"that sounds like Mac [DeMarco]\". The pair\'s early recordings were made by holding instruments to the internal microphone of an iPad running GarageBand. Augustin and Winemiller, initially unsure of what to call their new project, turned to an online random word generator that landed on \"vansire\", an alternative name for the Marsh mongoose. From there, the two continued to record together in their basements, living rooms, and bedrooms under the new Vansire moniker.\r\n\r\nIn August 2016, Vansire self-released their first album, \"Reflections and Reveries\". The duo recorded the album entirely in Winemiller\'s basement in a roughly one-year period from August 2015 to August 2016, and included Winemiller\'s brother, Issac, on bass for some songs.\r\n\r\nDuring this time, Augustin began studying at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music and Oberlin College, while Winemiller started at the University of Minnesota. Despite the distance, the duo vowed to remain committed to the Vansire project, now describing it as \"a long-distance band relationship.\"\r\n\r\nVansire released their second album Angel Youth in April 2018 on Spirit Goth Records. Augustin and Winemiller produced and mastered the album themselves, and it is the band\'s first full-length album that featured collaborations with other artists.\r\n\r\nIn June 2019, the duo released their single \"Metamodernity\", also recording an Audiotree Live session at Audiotree\'s studios in Chicago later that August.\r\n\r\nIn July 2020, Vansire released \"Central Time\", a single featuring Chicago-based rapper Mick Jenkins in their first collaboration together. In an interview announcing the single, Augustin said the single began as an instrumental demo that Winemiller sent him in September 2019, which sat untouched for roughly eight months until the duo returned back to it, finishing it up at the beginning of June 2020.\r\n\r\nDuring this period of the band\'s history, Augustin said that Vansire found itself leaning in an \"increasingly dance-oriented direction\" with regard to musical sound and that the duo has started to draw influence from more \"dancey, funk-imbued music\".\r\n\r\nOn October 16, 2020, Vansire released \"After Fillmore County\", a seven-song EP that brought back FLOOR CRY, and featured Philadelphia-based rapper Ivy Sole. In April 2021, Vansire released a remix of Sydney-based producer-artist Swaine Delgado\'s \"F Me Up\", their first remix.

Displeased with the promotion of the record, she signed to Go! Beat and released her third studio album, Colour the Small One, in 2004. The project struggled to connect with a mainstream audience, and so Sia relocated to New York City in 2005 and began touring across the United States. She released her fourth and fifth studio releases, Some People Have Real Problems and We Are Born, in 2008 and 2010, respectively. She then took a hiatus from performing, during which she focused on songwriting for other artists.

Seven Lions\' Polarize EP, one of the most promising releases of the last year in the EDM world, just dropped in April of 2012 and has already garnered praise for its melding of main room bombast with a very sensitive, human touch.\r\n\r\nFor Seven Lions (né Jeff Montalvo) ‘fast’ is an understatement for how his work has spread virally amongst fans of trance, dubstep, and everything in between. The 25 year old California native has been the center of attention as of late but has maintained a humility throughout. The artist released an unofficial remix of Florence and the Machine\'s \"Cosmic Love\" in March and has been a runaway YouTube hit as Florence\'s vocals align perfectly with the producer\'s yearning, sinewy compositions. Following the release of the Polarize EP (which charted in the top 5 overall charts on BeatPort), several of his productions are at any given time on the BeatPort dubstep Top 30. \r\n\r\nHis international following has grown exponentially over the past few months -everything from getting airplay on BBC\'s Radio1 to headlining seminal clubs in the States and elsewhere, but this is no overnight success story. It started early on in his life when, at age 7, his father brought home the family\'s first computer: a Macintosh and keyboard. After playing in metal and punk bands throughout middle school and high school, Montalvo segued into production in his late teens. \r\n\r\n“For me, it was the most accessible thing, to start picking up something like drums as opposed to something like electronic music. My transition out of playing with a band was because I got tired of waiting for my band all the time — I wanted to just start making music so I started composing electronic music by myself,” Montalvo explains.\r\n\r\nAfter a friend gave Montalvo the program Fruity Loops, he began experimenting with industrial drum beats and toying with genre cross-pollinations. Montalvo attended his first rave in 2007 and was immediately inspired to produce trance. However, he slowly found that broken beat came more naturally to the drummer-at-heart. “It’s more like playing a real instrument, as opposed to doing the four-on-the-floor disco beat. It’s more natural for me,” he says.\r\n\r\nNot long after, his remix of Above & Beyond feat. Zoe Johnston’s “You Got To Go” served as his breakout hit and introduction to the EDM world. “I won the official remix competition, which is how I got involved with [Above & Beyond]. I don’t know if they were expecting the track to do as well as it did. But it definitely got their attention, and now they’re wanting to work with me more.\" \r\n\r\nThat the remix “did well” is an understatement — typical of the soft-spoken Montalvo. The meteoric track sat at #2 on Beatport\'s Dubstep chart for over 6 weeks, second only to Skrillex\'s remix of \"Levels\", with hundreds of thousands of listens on YouTube. \r\n\r\nFrom metal band member, to solo industrial producer, to a trance-dub trailblazer — he\'s already achieved quite a diverse oeuvre, but his work seems to be only beginning. An innovative, fresh-thinking producer, Seven Lions is one of the more beautiful but dance-centered artists you\'re likely to discover for a while.\r\n\r\nSupport and follow on:\r\nhttp://soundcloud.com/seven-lions\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/SEVENLIONSofficial\r\nhttp://twitter.com/SevenLionsMusic \r\nhttps://new.myspace.com/sevenlions/ <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Seven+Lions\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

He was surrounded by a family of musicians, he began playing the piano at the age of four. After several years of learning to master the piano, Anton began playing the drums in a band, and composed and produced numerous rocksongs in his band\'s own studio. In 2009 he began producing electronic clubmusic, to much and quick acclaim. After a period of only few months he attained a remarkable level and participated in Beatport\'s \"Armand Van Helden / Strictly Rhythm Remix Contest\", which he went on to win. This opened up a number of new possibilities for Zedd, and only shortly after, he won his second contest on Beatport, the \"Fatboy Slim / Skint Remix Contest\"! This was the foundation for several cooperations with artists such as Black Eyed Peas, Lady Gaga, P. Diddy, Skrillex, Fatboy Slim, Armand Van Helden and labels like mau5trap, Interscope, Atlantic, Strictly Rhythm or Skint Records. His first release \"The Anthem\" entered the Beatport charts top 20, and even made it to the second place of Track It Down charts. His remix for Skrillex\' \'Scary Monsters And Nice Sprites\', released on \'mau5trap recordings\' climbed up the charts to #4 on Beatport and #2 on Beatport\'s Electro House charts. Zedd released his single \"Shave It\" on October 4th 2011 via Beatport under Skrillex\'s new label OWSLA. \"Shave It\" is Zedd\'s first single with OWSLA. One of the reasons for this rapid development is undoubtedly Zedd\'s unique and highly recognizable style of composition. It stands out as very detailed and carefully produced Electro House, very playful and the same time remarkably catchy. Zedd is definitely an artist to look out for in the future... <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Zedd\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

I love hearing it, writing it, performing it, arranging it, and recording it. It\'s in my blood! Ever since I was 3 years old I would watch musicians on stage and dream of doing the same thing. When I was 10 years old I started learning the drums and playing regularly at church. I later had the privilage of playing drums for artists, \'Heather Clark\' and “Greg Sczebel” for a total of 4 years each. My passion for writing developed when I was around 12 years old when I learned to play guitar. I would hear a song on the radio and think “ I would love to do that!” So I would experiment with chords and melodies. Hooks would just kind of pop out! So I learned how to build these hooks into songs. When I was in grade 11 I recorded a 3 song demo, and with it won a competition to play at the \'Van\'s Warped Tour\' in Calgary, AB. I have been nurturing a dream for music ever since. Earlier this year, I finished recording a 5 song EP at \'The Armoury Studios\' in Vancouver, BC. I had the privilage of working with some amazing musicians, as well as performing drums and producing two of the tracks on my own. The album will feature songs that I have been writing over the past 5 years and will be targeted toward mainstream radio as well as label A&R reps. Digital release date will be early this fall. This album will be my first ever, and I hope the start of something much bigger! <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Dan+Bremnes\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Mentored from youth by her mother, it was evident that songwriting was her passion, entering The Guardian’s Short Story competition at the age of 9. Aided by a voracious appetite for a story, Maisie has a mature yet innocent point of view from which her songs are crafted – with an overarching theme exploring the changing world as her generation grows.\r\n\r\nIn 2015, she started uploading her original songs onto her YouTube channel, gathering hundreds of thousands of views. In 2017, she released her first single Place We Were Made, which has amassed nearly 42 million plays on Spotify as of August 2021. She followed up later that year with the similarly stripped-down piano ballad Birthday. The songs gained attention in indie-pop circles and  Place We Were Made was named BBC Introducing\'s song of the week early 2018. Following this attention, Peters signed with Atlantic Records UK. Under their banner, she released various singles and two EPs, Dressed Too Nice for a Jacket and It\'s Your Bed Babe, It\'s Your Funeral. Both Feels Like This and Favourite Ex appeared on Love Island in 2019.\r\n\r\nIn 2020, Peters contributed the song Smile to the soundtrack album Birds of Prey: The Album, for the film Birds of Prey (2020). She was also announced as the opening act for Niall Horan \'s Nice to Meet Ya Tour on tourdates in Europe. However, these concerts were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Peters released work for another soundtrack in 2021, this time for Trying: Season 2 (Apple TV+ Original Series Soundtrack). She wrote and performed all songs, with a feature by fellow British recording artist James Bay on the song Funeral.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of June 2021, Peters left Atlantic Records and signed with Ed Sheeran \'s Gingerbread Man Records. Under this label, she released her debut album You Signed Up for This on 27 August 2021. The album debuted at number 2 on the UK Albums Chart and was the top selling album in UK independent record stores for that week. With the first two singles of the record, John Hughes Movie and Psycho, Peters garnered her first notations on the British charts.\r\n\r\nPeters embarked on her first headlining tour in 2022, touring the United States. Later that year, she joined Ed Sheeran \'s +–=÷x Tour as opening act. While touring she released singles Cate\'s Brother, Blonde, Good Enough and Not Another Rockstar. She cited various (pop) rock bands as influences in her new music. Peters has announced she will tour Europe, Asia, Australia and New Zealand in 2023. Peters has also performed at festivals such as Glastonbury and Lollapalooza. \r\n\r\nIn January 2023, Peters released Body Better, the lead single from her second album, calling it one of her \"most honest songs ever\". Following this, she announced her second album The Good Witch, alongside its tracklist, to be released on 23 June 2023, describing it as her own \"twisted version of a breakup album\". To promote the album, fifteen weeks before the release, Peters began posting weekly tarot cards designed around each track on the album in company of a description of the song. On 31 March, the second single of the album, Lost The Breakup, was released. Peters also announced dates for her North American tour ,The Good Witch Tour, with support from Grace Enger and dates for her UK tour, The Road to Wembley Tour.

After initially attempting to write comedy songs, she began writing songs that embodied her emotions such as \"feelings are fatal\", which only required a USB microphone and GarageBand. The song currently has over 23 million streams on Spotify. Her 2017 collaboration with Japanese lo-fi producer peachy!, \"Falling for U\", reached nearly 40 million streams on Spotify by June 2019. Maia began secretly releasing music to the public, but was later compelled to tell her friends and family after experiencing viral success online. In 2018, Maia released her debut EP, plum blossom, which was reviewed by Earmilk, i-D and Hypebeast, and gained more than 100 million streams on Spotify by August 2019.

The album peaked at 17 on the US Heatseekers Chart and at 45 on the US Indie Albums Chart. It features \"prom dress\", a \"light and peachy tune\" described as \"relatable, infectious hook-led pop that speaks to millennials\". The single is inspired by experiences from her own big night and deals with social anxiety and the problems that come with being a teen in modern society. The song has been streamed over 30 million times on Spotify, and has been used in 100,000 videos on TikTok. Maia\'s back catalogue of songs have also received tens of millions of online streams.\r\n\r\nJoshua Bote of Paste described the ten-track album as \"comforting twee-pop that wrings out genuine pathos from mxmtoon’s internet celebrity\".

The word Dexys in this case, comes from a colloquialism of dextroamphetamine, a type of amphetamine diet pill that was a popular \'upper\' drug with England\'s Northern Soul scene in the 1960s.\r\n\r\nFounded in 1978 by former singer of the Killjoys, Kevin Rowland, and guitarist Kevin \"Al\" Archer, in Birmingham (United Kingdom), the band was unique in that musically, they seemed best suited to the budding Mod/Skinhead Revival scene in the United Kingdom, but in many ways, especially fashion, they came off as rather hard to \'sell\' to any particular scene.  Musically, they\'ve always been a sort of \"soul-fusion.\"\r\n\r\nAn early single, \"Geno\" (written as an ode to American Northern Soul singer, Geno Washington), was immensely popular, despite being repeatedly bad-mouthed by the NME. In fact, \"Geno\" remains their biggest-selling single in the UK, thanks in part to at least one re-issue.\r\n\r\nThe following album, Searching for the Young Soul Rebels (1980), was an interesting punk and soul fusion, and despite (or perhaps because of) decidedly mixed reviews by the press, it was extremely well-received by the public.\r\n\r\nTheir second album, Too Rye Aye (1982), had a decidedly different sound, thanks largely to an immense line-up change, most notable for the fact that the horn section of ...Young Soul Rebels had been replaced by \"the Emerald Express,\" the band\'s Celtic folk section (featuring violinist Helen O\'Hara). The sound was still obviously soul influenced, at the very least, but this time it was Celtic soul. The album\'s first UK single was even titled \"Celtic Soul Brothers.\"\r\n\r\nToo-Rye-Aye was the most popular Dexys album Stateside, in fact it was the only one to break US charts, (though the album itself was only a modest to intermediate success in the US).  This is largely because the US a-side single for \"Come On Eileen\" was debatably too popular (the single has been re-issued at least once in the UK; despite this, \"Geno\" was still their biggest-selling UK single).  Undoubtedly the most \"pop radio\"-oriented song of the entire Dexys Midnight Runners catalogue.\r\n\r\nA third album, Don\'t Stand Me Down was released in 1985 ending a three year silence from the band. It featured a noticeably different line-up. The ever-experimental Rowland abandoned the Too-Rye-Ay Celtic Soul/New Wave formula in favor of a more laidback Van Morrison conversational album. The previous album was a \"Big Band\" sound when compared to the new one (though, amusingly, the number of guest musicians featured on Don\'t Stand Me Down, plus the credited band members, seemed to outnumber all previous members of Dexys combined, including ex-Dexys who had recorded only song before leaving).  \r\n\r\nDon\'t Stand Me Down was well-received by critics though universally ignored by the music-buying public due in large part to Rowland stubbornly refusing to release any song from the album as a single, until considerably \"late\" after its release, as well as confusing listeners who may have been expecting a sequel to Too-Rye-Ay\'s Dance Pop. Sales of the album were sparse and it was considered a failure by the label. In the 20-plus years since it\'s original release it has come to be viewed by many as Rowland\'s magnum opus. \r\n\r\nAfter Rowland\'s first solo endeavor in 1988, Dexys was briefly reformed in 1993, by Rowland with Big Jim Patterson, though this endeavor resulted in little, if anything more than a television performance.\r\n\r\nIn 2003, the career retrospective album (\'don\'t call it a \"greatest hits\" collection\'), Let\'s Make This Precious was released, featuring two new tracks, \"Manhood\" and \"My Life In England, Part One.\" The new tracks were touted as singles and received regular radio play in the UK, though never commercially released outside the album.\r\n\r\nRowland officially announced in June 2005 that Dexys were back in the studio, recording and seeking a new contract.  The current line-up includes Rowland Mick Talbot (former member of Merton Parkas and Hammond player for Paul Weller).\r\n\r\nIn the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die, notably, Dexys Midnight Runners are the only band to have all of their albums listed, and with a full page review for each album (understandably, most albums only get a half-page review).  All three albums received glowing reviews, save Too-Rye-Aye, wherein it was noted \"[[i]Too-Rye-Aye] is the worst of the three Dexys albums; but if this is the worst album in your collection, pat yourself on the back.\" <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Dexys+Midnight+Runners\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The label originally featured such artists as Glasses Malone, Vita, and Nu Jerzey Devil, along with Game himself. His stage name was coined by his grandmother. Game first gained prominence when he attended a hip-hop summit hosted by Russell Simmons and Louis Farrakhan, releasing his first mixtape You Know What It Is Vol. 1 in 2002, followed by a record deal with the independent label, Get Low Recordz owned by JT the Bigga Figga. Originally Sean Combs of Bad Boy Records was going to sign him to his label, but Game\'s mixtape found the attention of famed producer Dr. Dre, who signed him to Aftermath Entertainment in 2003. In October 2004, he released his first album Untold Story through Get Low Recordz, which sold over 82,000 copies within its first three months. The album featured artists like Sean T, Young Noble (of the Outlawz), and JT the Bigga Figga. Game also appeared on various mixtapes hosted by DJ\'s such as DJ Kayslay, DJ Whoo Kid, and DJ Clue.

The remainder of King comprised Tony Wall (bass), Mick Roberts (keyboards), James Lantsbery (guitar) and ex-Members Adrian Lillywhite (drums). They made their debut supporting the Mighty Wah! and signed to CBS Records. Despite extensive touring and a sizeable following, their first three singles and Steps In Time sold poorly. The break came late in 1984 when they supported Culture Club and reached a whole new teen audience. \"Love And Pride\" was released early next year, and made number 2 in the UK chart, while the album went to number 6. The hits continued throughout the year, most notably with the Top 10 hit, \"Alone Without You\", but King abruptly disbanded in 1986. Paul King pursued a solo career, releasing Joy in 1987, which at best gave him a minor UK hit with \"I Know\". The band will probably be remembered as much for their trademark spray-painted Dr. Martens boots and Paul King\'s affable personality than for their engaging pop songs. Paul King later became a video disc jockey for MTV.\r\n\r\n2) KING (American Soul trio) THE STORY began on an August afternoon in Los Angeles, or in a winter rehearsal session in Boston, or in April 1986 in Minneapolis, depending on how you define destiny.\r\n\r\nTwins Paris and Amber Strother began their musical journey by listening to favorites of their parents together from the crib, and once they were able to crawl found their way to the piano. Amber nurtured her gift for singing by absorbing everything musical around her, and in turn developed an intricate, magical tone and one-of-a-kind voice, as well as a unique skill for composition and songwriting. Through exploring a melting pot of artists, genres, musical ideas and movements, Paris found her own personal voice for the keys. The twins spent years unknowingly ripening their craft of writing together until they parted ways and left Minneapolis, with Amber to pursue studies in Chicago and Paris to enroll at music school in Boston where…\r\n\r\nA chance meeting with a young woman with a golden voice and incredible ear changed her life. Los Angeles native Anita Bias had fallen in love with music and art as a young girl, and spent years cultivating her voice, imaginative and vivid songwriting, and creative styling. Their Boston encounter stayed fresh in the minds of both, and when fate brought Paris to California and reunited them years later at a club in Los Angeles, they knew it was the start of something special.\r\n\r\nDuring Amber\'s first trip to LA and the living room session that followed, the three realized that they were born to create together. At the first show of the unofficial and then-unnamed band, they, along with the audience, were said to have seen fireworks in the air. The unique blend of voices, engaging harmony, and detailed songwriting the group exhibited came completely naturally to them. Amber, who had been since moved back to Minneapolis, sent for her belongings. KING was born.\r\n\r\nTHE STORY EP is KING\'s debut project, wherein all songs are written by Paris, Amber, and Anita, and fully produced by Paris. THE STORY, SUPERNATURAL, and HEY are the result of a year\'s worth of loving and learning, experiencing and experimenting, and ultimately finding the music within themselves.\r\n\r\nSee We Are King.\r\n\r\n3) King (Toronoto) plays untraditional Dark Black Metal filled with dread and an eerie atmosphere offering a few interesting twists and surprises along the way.

RYO, the band’s founder, named the band KING after his pet Chihuahua.

Originally, it was intended to be RYO\'s solo project, with session musicians as his back-up band. At that first live, the first of an ever expanding series of live sale only demos was released. These demos are all titled \"ワン\" (\"wan,\" Japanese onomatopoeia for dog noises) multiplied by whatever volume number it is in the series.

In March of 2006, they finally released their first single, Starlit sky, on a more powerful (but still indies) label, AZ Entertainment. Starlit sky hit #6 on the Oricon indies chart and #83 overall. They released two more singles (Stand up, Darling Romeo and Juliet) and an album (CROSS WORLD) with AZ, but were dropped from the label sometime after the release of Darling. They also closed their fanclub and moved their website at that time.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, they celebrated their fifth anniversary by releasing three singles (火の玉ファイヤーボーイ(hi no tama FIRE BOY), Never“Tattoo”Mind and INAZUMA THUNDER GIRL), one each month from September to November. In 2009 they began releasing demos again, four total with one track each.

Tobias Topic (born March 23, 1992) is a Croatian-German DJ, producer and musician. In 2008, he started using Logic Studio, a digital audio workstation, to produce music with the guidance of a teacher. He started his musical career on social media with the assistance of YouTube musicians who contacted him.\r\n\r\nTopic\'s first release, a house song called \"Light It Up\", was released at the end of 2014 and reached more than one million views on his YouTube channel. In summer 2015, he released his debut album Miles. In 2019, he released his single \"Breaking Me\", featuring Swedish singer A7S.

In October 2020, the single reached 500 million streams on Spotify and over one billion streams overall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Life for ‘Topic’ began in West LA and evolved in West Covina throughout his adolescent years. The Yin and Yang lifestyle of religious based principles instilled by his mother and hard knock life experiences learned from his father laid the foundation on which this universal rap artist was formed.\r\n\r\nExtremely confident in his ability to write or rap about anything, hence the evolution of the epithet “Topic’. No literary form of expression can exist without a ‘Topic’. Having a true love for music since the early days of his youth, Topic began singing and writing his own lyrics in grade school. By the summer of 8th grade writing his first rhyme created a natural euphoria for the lyricist, and an addiction for which there is no cure, only temporary relief. In 1993, Topic had his first experience in a professional recording studio. He took advantage of the opportunity and learned all he could about the mechanics behind the development of a song.\r\n\r\nAn innate passion for writing combined with being outspoken and a natural leader, this lyricist is certain to accomplish what he wants. What he wants is to share his truth on different points of discussion by expressing them in his lyrics. There is truly no fear emanating from this man when a pen is in hand. In love with the lyrics that flow from his soul he stirs up the game on a mental level while stimulating your desire to move to the beat.\r\n\r\nAlong with staying modest, balancing confidence with humility and driven by a passion to spit the truth, Topic began performing in local clubs, competitions and underground spots throughout LA, the Inland Empire, and West Covina. The development of his own company BOSS (Business Over Stupid Shit) Life World Inc. is a testament to the prodigious potential the artist possesses.\r\n\r\nTopic has endured a series of tribulations synonymous with the testing of Job. His lyrical schemes reflect the influence of his life experiences as well as those around him. Marrying his strengths, insecurities and weaknesses with the melodic element of hip-hop, it is ingenious the way he brings the truth so uninhibited it exposes the very soul of the man.\r\n\r\nThe Boss of it all with a canvas of soul felt, epic beats of street life and hard-core hustle make it difficult for you to ignore the formidable hip-hop rap artist. Possessing all attributes of a West Coast gangster but the demeanor of a true businessman, this prolific rapper honed his skills and landed a record deal with SRC Universal through the independent label Drama Family.\r\n\r\nPreviously working with “WC” of Westside Connection, Knocturnal, and Shanta formerly of Aftermath, also alongside producers such as; Johnathan “JR” Rotem, Cool and Dre, Jelly Roll, and Neff-u who has production credits for almost every music genre, and artist from Dr. Dre to U2. Now label mates with such artists as the world renowned multi-platinum selling Akon and David Banner, Topic will soon accomplish his mission to make a predominant impact in the Industry.\r\n\r\n‘Topic’ can be defined as complex but not complicated, simplistic but by no means simple. Ardently motivated by success and God’s timing the intimate, hard-hitting songs written by this artist are sure to induce an encore. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Topic\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Movements are a post-hardcore band from Rancho Santa Margarita, California, formed in 2015. \r\n\r\nReflecting personal changes from a whirlwind five years, Movements realize the full scope of their storytelling, musicianship, and vision on their second full-length album, No Good Left To Give [Fearless Records]. Not only does the music address the emotional push-and-pull of relationships, but it also explores loss, love, mental health, and even intimacy through a prism of newfound clarity soundtracked by post-punk grit, alternative expanse, heartfelt spoken word, expansive rock, and subtle pop ambition. The Southern California quartet—Patrick Miranda [vocals], Ira George [guitar], Spencer York [drums], and Austin Cressey [bass]—quietly worked towards this moment since forming in 2015. Following the 2016 EP Outgrown Things, the group cemented a singular sound on their 2017 full-length debut, Feel Something. Eclipsing 40 million total streams by 2020, it immediately connected by way of “Daylilly” [11.1 million Spotify streams], “Full Circle” [6.1 million Spotify streams], and “Colorblind” [5.5 million Spotify streams]. Along the way, the four-piece received acclaim from Brooklyn Vegan, AXS, Rock Sound, Culture Collide, and more. In between packing shows worldwide, they joined forces with Alzheimer’s Association for the “Deadly Dull” video and covered “Losing My Religion” by R.E.M. for the Songs that Saved My Life compilation. \r\n\r\nhttps://found.ee/Movements\r\n\r\n2.) Movements is a band from Jyväskylä, Finland. The band was formed about 3 years ago. For all the members music is a way of life. The first EP \"first step\" was released in 2005. A second 3-song EP (\"northern lights\") came out on Dec. 1st. 06. \r\n\r\n3.) When in 1993 some musicians got together in Bielefeld to form a Reggae band they named the band MOVEMENTS. This name expressed their feeling of being part of the MOVEMENT OF JAH PEOPLE - the spiritual and mental exodus from Babylon. They were inspired by the uniting power of RASTAFARI, the movement that has made it’s way from the island of Jamaica to Europe ever since the seventies and is best known for it’s Reggae music. But they probably had no idea how much the name would be defining the band’s development - constantly moving and changing but always true to the message and the way of the Roots. \r\n\r\nThe love for reggae brought them together and due to the band’s international character it became their goal to bring together different people through their music. And in their opinion the best way to do this was Roots-Reggae which unites all people. So the musical orientation was clear from the beginning. Nevertheless the music picked up many different individual styles. It’s these ups and downs which show vividly in the music and make it unique. Since the early days of the Rasta pioneers like Bob Marley, Peter Tosh, Burning Spear and several others much has changed in the world’s conception of Roots Reggae. It’s widely accepted and appreciated by it’s fans as the true original form of Reggae. Roots Reggae is timeless but not always mainstream. \r\n\r\nMOVEMENTS convinced both fans and critics partly because of the cooperation with national and international artists. Names like Xavier Naidoo, D-Flame, Brothers Keepers and Söhne Mannheims speak for themselves.\r\n\r\nFrontman is one of the bands founders, Uwe “Banton”, who is composer and song writer of most of the MOVEMENTS’ songs and determines the band’s musical direction. In 1999 he introduced the Jamaican singer Jah Meek to the band and since then they cooperate on stage and as song writers. Though the band’s members change periodically it doesn’t keep the MOVEMENTS from moving on.\r\n\r\nThe MOVEMENTS definitely have a message and they deliver it by using form and language of the authentic Reggae. But apart from songs in English their repertoire also includes German texts, both moving and religious at the same time. Long is the list of festivals and clubs where the band has played over the years. Three CDs have been released and another one is in progress. This time the musicians have seeked cooperation with other artists. And famous musicians such as Gentleman and Prezident Brown agreed to contribute to the MOVEMENTS new album.\r\n\r\n4.) Movements is a former member of UTH. A gang based in South London, Lambeth, United Kingdom. Movements made his name with his trilogy of mixtapes ‘Twiss Up’ which featured major UK Drill artists, AM, Skengdo, V9, Stickz, Ard Adz, M Dargg etc. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Movements\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

They had the several UK and worldwide hits during the 1980s and 1990s.\r\n\r\nTheir highest-charting single in the UK was \"Lessons in Love\", which reached number three on the UK Singles Chart, and number 12 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, upon its release in 1986. An earlier single, \"Something About You\", was their most successful chart-wise in the United States, reaching number 7 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. After much success as a live and studio band in the 1980s, Level 42\'s commercial profile diminished during the early 1990s following a series of personnel changes and musical shifts. Disbanding in 1994, the band reformed in 2001. \r\n\r\nHistory\r\n1979–1980: Prehistory and formation:\r\nMark King and the Gould brothers (Phil and Rowland, the latter was generally known by his nickname Boon) were all brought up on the Isle of Wight and played together in various bands during their teenage years. Phil Gould went on to study at London\'s Guildhall School of Music and Drama, where he met keyboard player Mike Lindup in a percussion course. Both musicians found that they had the same feelings about musical heroes: Miles Davis, John McLaughlin, Keith Jarrett, and Jan Hammer.\r\n\r\nBy 1979, Phil Gould and Mark King were both based in London and became involved in Robin Scott\'s pop project M. While working with M, they became acquainted with Afro-French keyboard player Wally Badarou, who played synthesizer on M\'s US number-one single \"Pop Muzik\". In late 1979, Phil Gould introduced Mark King and Mike Lindup to each other, and all of them began playing together in loose rehearsal sessions, developing their jazz-funk fusion style. The developing band\'s original guitarist was Dominic Miller (later to find fame playing with Sting), but he was replaced by Boon Gould on the latter\'s return from working in the United States.\r\n\r\nInitially, instrumental roles were flexible, with Boon Gould also playing bass guitar and saxophone and Lindup doubling on keyboards and drums. Mark King was primarily a drummer (although he also played guitar) but had recently sold his drum kit to pay for transport back to the UK after an ill-fated European venture. With Phil Gould and Boon Gould established (respectively) as the most accomplished drummer and guitarist in the quartet, King opted to learn bass guitar instead. At the time, King was working in a London music store. A notably flexible musician and quick learner, he had observed visiting American funk players demonstrating the thumb-slap bass guitar technique and developed his take on the style in a matter of weeks.\r\n\r\nThe developing band (at this point, entirely an instrumental act) took the name Level 42 and settled on a working line-up of King (bass guitar, percussion), Lindup (keyboards, percussion), Boon Gould (guitar, saxophone), and Phil Gould (drums). The name of the band is a reference to the novel The Hitchhiker\'s Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams, in which \"42\" is the answer to \"the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything.\" Having maintained their links with Wally Badarou, Phil Gould, and Mark King invited him to work with Level 42. Although he never formally joined the band, Badarou would become a fifth member in all but name: co-writing songs, playing keyboards and synthesizers in the studio, and co-producing the records.\r\n\r\n1980–1983: Early albums (Level 42, The Early Tapes, The Pursuit of Accidents)\r\nAfter they were seen, jamming together, Level 42 were invited to sign to Elite Records (a small independent label) in 1980. They were also encouraged to branch out into vocal music. Having considered recruiting a singer, the band eventually settled on giving King and Lindup the vocal role. The two men developed a complementary style, with Lindup\'s falsetto frequently used for harmonies and choruses while King\'s deep tenor led the verses (although Lindup would also sing entire songs on his own). The Gould brothers generally wrote lyrics while King, Badarou, and Lindup concentrated on Level 42\'s music.\r\n\r\nThe Elite Records single \"Love Meeting Love\" brought the band to the attention of Polydor Records, with whom they signed their second recording contract. In 1981, they released their first Polydor single, \"Love Games\", which became a Top 40 hit. They then cut their critically acclaimed self-titled debut album, which was an immediate success throughout Europe.\r\n\r\nThe band quickly established themselves as concert favorites on the budding British and European jazz-funk scene, taking advantage of the musical expertise and performance skills of all four members.[citation needed] Polydor capitalized on the band\'s success by releasing a second album, The Early Tapes later in the same year. This was a compilation of material from the Elite Records period (and is also known by an alternate name, Strategy).\r\n\r\nIn 1982, Level 42 released their third album The Pursuit of Accidents. This was a further development of the Level 42 formula, maintaining their instrumental jazz-funk skills and styling but also experimenting further with pop songs. Both of the singles from the album — \"Weave Your Spell\" and \"The Chinese Way\" — charted. The latter, in particular, raised high in the charts and gained the band a much wider audience than before.\r\n\r\n1983–1985: Moving towards pop (Standing in the Light and True Colours):\r\nA fourth album, Standing in the Light, was released in 1983. Produced by Larry Dunn and Verdine White (of Earth, Wind & Fire), this album began a new era for the band, being less experimental and less jazzy than previous releases. It provided them with their first UK Top Ten hit, \"The Sun Goes Down (Living It Up)\". Notably, the album featured no instrumental tracks, with the band now focusing heavily on songs. (The band would not release another instrumental on an album until 1988\'s Staring at the Sun).\r\n\r\nThe 1984 album True Colours continued the band\'s development away from primarily jazz-funk based music, switching between funk, power pop, mid-tempo rock, and moody ballads. It yielded the singles \"The Chant Has Begun\" and \"Hot Water\". The latter was a Top 20 hit in Britain and a Top 5 hit in the Netherlands where the band became popular (the song reached also No. 7 in Belgium). During the same year, Mark King released his first solo album Influences on which he played the majority of the instruments (with a guest appearance by Aswad\'s Drummie Zeb, and with Lindup guesting on additional keyboards).\r\n\r\nLevel 42 became known for their power as a live band (as showcased on the 1985 double live album A Physical Presence). For live gigs the band added saxophonist Krys Mach, who toured with the group from 1984 to 1988 and contributed to some album recordings.\r\n\r\n1985–1987: Worldwide fame (World Machine and Running in the Family) and split of the original line-up\r\nBy this time, the band was well established in their mainstream pop/rock sound, as evidenced on their next studio album, World Machine, released later in 1985. King\'s dextrous bass playing and Lindup and Badarou\'s chugging keyboards acted as templates for pop songs such as \"Something About You\" and \"Leaving Me Now\", which were both UK Top 20 hits (Top 40 hits in the Netherlands).\r\n\r\nSignificantly, \"Something About You\" was also their first (and only) US Top 10 the following year; also reaching the Top 5 in Canada and the Top 20 in Italy and New Zealand. \"Leaving Me Now\" was the second hit from this album, peaking at No. 15 in the United Kingdom but proving less successful in Europe. Elements of Level 42\'s roots could still be found in the funky \"Coup d\'État\" and \"Dream Crazy\" on the UK version of the album, as well as a long instrumental track named \"Hell,\" which was also recorded during the World Machine sessions (This last track did not see the light of day until the early 2000s as an MP3 download on the original Napster).\r\n\r\nWorld Machine gained positive reviews from critics, with AllMusic journalist William Cooper, in a retrospective review, describing it as \"one of the finest pop albums of the mid-\'80s.\" During the recording of the album, the first major tensions between Phil Gould and Mark King began to surface over musical direction, production, and their relationship. This clashing led to Gould leaving the band for a week. Allan Holdsworth\'s drummer Gary Husband was lined up as a potential replacement, but Gould and King\'s dispute was subsequently patched up and the group went on to enjoy their most successful year to date.\r\n\r\nReleased in early 1986 (and initially recorded to keep up the band\'s European chart momentum while the band was busy touring the United States), \"Lessons in Love\" was an international hit and became Level 42\'s biggest selling single.[citation needed] It gave the band their first number one in Denmark, Germany, Switzerland, and South Africa, increasing the band\'s popularity considerably. It also placed at No. 2 in Italy, the Netherlands, and Sweden, No. 3 in the UK and Ireland, No. 4 in Austria, No. 10 in Norway, No. 12 in the US in 1987, No. 18 in New Zealand, and No. 22 in France).\r\n\r\n\"Lessons in Love\" became the lead single on 1987\'s Running in the Family album, recorded to capitalize on the impact. With the band now at the peak of their success, the album added further gloss to Level 42\'s polished pop sound (despite adding to Phil Gould\'s disquiet). Further singles from the album continued and built on the band\'s existing profile: \"To Be With You Again\" (No. 6 in the Netherlands and Ireland), the ballad \"It\'s Over\" (No. 3 in Ireland and No. 7 in the Netherlands) and Running In The Family\'s title track (No. 1 in Denmark, No. 3 in the Netherlands, No. 4 in Ireland, No. 5 in Switzerland, No. 7 in Norway and No. 9 in New Zealand). The album itself was a major international success, reaching the Top 10 in numerous countries.\r\n\r\nBy now a leading British pop band, Level 42 played at the Prince\'s Trust concert in June 1987, with Eric Clapton standing in on lead guitar for a performance of \"Running in the Family\". King and Lindup also performed with artists including Ben E. King on \"Stand By Me\" and George Harrison and Ringo Starr on \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\".\r\n\r\nDespite the success, Level 42 was on the brink of splitting up. Although Phil Gould was the most visibly dissatisfied member, Boon Gould was the first to leave, departing in late 1987, following a support slot on a Madonna tour. The quietest member of the band, Boon surprised both King and Lindup with his sudden departure. However, he had been suffering from nervous exhaustion and wanted to leave the lifestyle of a constantly touring musician to settle down and spend more time with his wife and children. Boon\'s relationship with the band remained amicable and, although he would not return to Level 42 as a performing or recording member, he continued to write lyrics for the band following his departure. Paul Gendler (an experienced session player who had previously been the guitarist for Modern Romance) temporarily replaced him for a six-week headlining tour and further support slots with Tina Turner.\r\n\r\nIn December 1987, midway through the tour, Phil Gould left Level 42 permanently. Like his brother, he was suffering from exhaustion, but his relationship with King had broken down once again and they now found it difficult to work together. Phil was also reportedly dissatisfied with the band\'s direction in terms of their newer \"pop\" sound, and King and Lindup failed to convince him to stay. To complete the tour dates, the band hired Prefab Sprout drummer Neil Conti to fill in.\r\n\r\n1988–1989: The second line-up (Staring at the Sun):\r\nFollowing the tour, Level 42 recruited Gary Husband as the band\'s new full-time drummer. He in turn recommended Steve Topping as a replacement guitarist. However, Topping and King\'s personalities clashed and Topping eventually left the band in early 1988 after initial writing and rehearsing sessions in Dublin. Most of the next Level 42 album, Staring at the Sun, was recorded without a permanent guitarist. Rhythm guitar on the studio recordings was handled either by the band\'s old friend Dominic Miller or by an uncredited Mark King. In April 1988, towards the end of the sessions, the band recruited lead guitarist Alan Murphy (a session guitarist who had worked extensively with Kate Bush and had been a member of Go West).\r\n\r\nStaring at the Sun was released in 1988, reaching number 2 in the UK and the top ten in several European charts. It included the hit single \"Heaven in My Hands\" (number 12 in the UK and the top twenty in the Netherlands, Norway, and Switzerland). Boon Gould had co-written many of the tracks with King, Lindup, and Badarou, while Gary Husband was credited with his first co-write with King on \"Tracie\" (a tribute to King\'s childhood sweetheart). To promote the album, Level 42 embarked on a four-month European tour, culminating in six sell-out nights at Wembley Arena. These latter dates were recorded for what would become the band\'s second live album, Live At Wembley (eventually released in 1996).\r\n\r\nAlthough the band seemed to have maintained their momentum and recovered well from the split of the original lineup, they were about to be hit by a serious tragedy. Unknown to the rest of Level 42, guitarist Alan Murphy was suffering from AIDS, something that he may have been aware of before joining the band. At the time, his previous band Go West had been stalled by internal disagreements, and one of Murphy\'s reasons for joining Level 42 was to ensure that he spent his last days playing the music that he loved. During 1989, Murphy contracted pneumonia: weakened by his existing condition, his decline was rapid and he died on 19 October 1989.\r\n\r\nDevastated, Level 42 took a year off to regroup and rethink. To cover the gap and to fulfill the band\'s contract with Polydor Records, Level Best (a greatest hits compilation) was released at the end of 1989; also marking a decade since the band\'s beginnings. During the break, Mike Lindup also recorded and released his debut solo album, Changes (featuring Dominic Miller, Pino Palladino on bass and Manu Katché on drums).\r\n\r\n1990–1992: Third and fourth lineups – Guaranteed album, Allan Holdsworth and Jakko Jakszyk:\r\nThe band signed a new contract with RCA Records in 1990, for whom they produced their next album, Guaranteed. Although Dominic Miller once again handled most of the rhythm guitar work, Gary Husband asked Allan Holdsworth to provide some guitar work (notably on \"A Kinder Eye\"). As well as drumming, Husband also played keyboards and increased his songwriting role, co-writing many tracks with King, Lindup, and Badarou. The album features the only track entirely written by Husband – \"If You Were Mine\" – that also featured on the \"Guaranteed\" single release. Mark King also collaborated with lyricists Drew Barfield and George Green to expand the songwriting. Guaranteed was well received by American music critics. However, the album did not get good reviews in the UK (despite reaching No. 3 in the UK charts while the title track reached No. 17 in the singles charts) and was ultimately less commercially successful than previous efforts.\r\n\r\nIn December 1990, Level 42 returned to play a record run of concerts at Hammersmith Odeon, London, in part fulfilling booking obligations preceding the band\'s recent hiatus. The concerts featured Allan Holdsworth (whom Husband had asked to play as a favor while the band searched for a permanent guitarist) plus four additional players: Lyndon Connah (ex-64 Spoons) on additional keyboards and percussion and sharing backing vocals with Annie McCaig, plus the horn section from the Guaranteed album (John Thirkell and Gary Barnacle).\r\n\r\nAfter the recording of Guaranteed and a weeklong promotional tour, Level 42 needed a permanent guitarist. Mark King assumed (erroneously) that Allan Holdsworth would not be interested in taking the position. Instead, the band recruited well-respected art-pop guitarist, session player, and sometime solo artist Jakko Jakszyk: the former frontman for 64 Spoons, he had also collaborated with Tom Robinson, Sam Brown, and Stewart/Gaskin among others. Although he did not play on Guaranteed, Jakszyk appeared on the album\'s cover photo and took part in promotional duties and the tour for the album, as well as playing on two B-sides from this era (\"At This Great Distance\" and \"As Years Go By\").\r\n\r\nUnlike Husband, Jakszyk never became a full legal member of the band (apparently due to \"record company politics\"). However, following the end of promotion for Guaranteed, the King-Lindup-Husband-Jakszyk line began writing and recording new material together, with at least two songs (\"Fire\" and \"Free Your Soul\") completed. Following the next development in the band\'s history, this work was shelved and remains unreleased.\r\n\r\n1993–1994: Fifth and sixth lineups (including the brief return of Phil Gould), Forever Now and disbandment\r\nIn early 1993, Gary Husband left Level 42, leading to the return of group founder member Phil Gould as Level 42\'s drummer (and principal lyricist) for 1994\'s Forever Now album. Further changes to the band were evident in that Jakko Jakszyk did not play on the album: the American session guitarist Danny Blume (erroneously credited as “Danny Bloom” performed all guitars.\r\n\r\nAlthough Forever Now was a critical success, the reunion of Gould and the group was short-lived. When Level 42 began to promote the new album (with Jakszyk returning to the live band for concerts and TV appearances), Gould played only one promotional gig and did not go on the road for the Forever Now tour. Jakszyk’s friend and frequent collaborator Gavin Harrison (who later played drums for both Porcupine Tree and King Crimson) replaced him as a live drummer.\r\n\r\nIt was announced halfway through the Forever Now tour, on the day of the Manchester Apollo gig, which the band would be disbanding permanently following their concert commitments. Level 42 played their last gig at the Albert Hall in London on 14 October 1994. According to Jakszyk, the band recorded tapes for a live album during the final 1994 shows at the Albert Hall and the Brighton Dome which \"sounded fantastic\", but the album was never released.\r\n\r\n1996–2000: Mark King\'s solo years:\r\nIn 1996, Mark King signed to Virgin Records and released a solo single \"Bitter Moon\" (with Lyndon Connah playing keyboards). This was followed up by his second solo album One Man, featuring lyrics by Boon Gould. The album was not a big commercial success. \r\n\r\nKing later toured as a solo act, playing his new compositions and some Level 42 favorites. In 1999, he played some shows at the Jazz Cafe in London under the name of \"The Mark King Group\" with a band including Husband, Jakszyk, and Jakszyk\'s fellow former 64 Spoons colleague Lyndon Connah on keyboards. Jakszyk left the band after the Jazz Cafe shows, to be replaced on guitar by Nathan King (Mark King\'s younger brother). King continued to tour with this band, now renamed \"Grupo Mark King\", over the next couple of years, augmenting the line-up with saxophone player Sean Freeman.\r\n\r\nIn August 1999, three-quarters of the original Level 42 line-up reunited for a private show. Phil Gould invited some musician friends to play at a party, including his brother Boon and Mike Lindup. In 2001, Mark King, Mike Lindup, and Phil Gould played together at Lindup\'s wedding for the first time in ten years.[citation needed]\r\n\r\n2001–2005: Return of Level 42 (seventh lineup):\r\nAlthough Mark King released two solo albums, his previous band\'s music proved to be persistently popular and he found that he was playing more and more old Level 42 tracks at live shows.\r\n\r\nIn late 2001, King came to a business agreement with Mike Lindup and bought the rights to the name Level 42. Although Lindup agreed to play on future albums, he did not want to tour.[citation needed] King announced the return of Level 42 with a new line-up which also happened to be the musicians from his current live band: himself, Husband, Connah, Freeman, and Nathan King. On 12 July 2002, the first official Level 42 concert for six years was played at The Circus Tavern in Purfleet, Essex. While not recording any new material, for the next few years the band settled into a regular pattern of touring and playing old hits.\r\n\r\nOn 13 February 2005, there was a brief one-night reunion with Mike Lindup (who joined the band onstage for a date at The Forum in London)[citation needed] and over the year, there was a burst of reissue activity. Two Rockpalast shows from 1983 and 1984 were released on DVD, followed by two CD releases: The River Sessions (a live show from 1983 recorded in Scotland) and a new compilation called The Ultimate Collection II. The latter included a new song called \"Genius Of Love\", which was a Level 42 tribute/collaboration by the Italian-American dance producer Hardage, featuring Mark King on vocals and incorporating a sample of the Level 42 track \"I Want Eyes\".\r\n\r\n2006–2012: Retroglide and further tours and lineup changes:\r\nIn February 2006, after twelve years without releasing a new studio album, Level 42 announced the release of Retroglide. While billed as a band album, it was chiefly recorded and produced by King at his home studio, with Gary Husband, Lyndon Connah, Sean Freeman, and Nathan King all contributing.\r\n\r\nRetroglide also featured input from two previous Level 42 members. Erstwhile guitarist Boon Gould provided the album\'s lyrics (as well as contributing a guitar solo on \"Ship\") and Mike Lindup, who added prominent keyboard parts and vocals to many tracks, effectively expanded the band to a six-piece via extensive guest performances. Although Phil Gould was uncredited on the album, the track \"Ship\" is the first song since 1986 worked on by all four original members, as Phil originally arranged the track with his brother Boon. However, Retroglide was also the first Level 42 album not to feature any contributions from Wally Badarou.\r\n\r\nIn May 2006, Level 42 announced that Mike Lindup would return full-time to replace Lyndon Connah on keyboards. Retroglide was promoted via a supporting tour throughout the UK, Netherlands, Germany, and several other European countries during October 2006. On 26 August 2007, Level 42 played an outdoor gig at the Arundel Festival in West Sussex: the band\'s only UK show of the year. In 2008, Level 42 played a twenty-date UK tour.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Husband stepped down as Level 42\'s drummer for the second time, due to prior commitments with John McLaughlin. Pete Ray Biggin replaced Husband. In 2012, Level 42 toured the UK and mainland Europe, in celebration of the 25th anniversary since the release of Running in the Family, by playing the whole album, with a whole array of other hits. Also included in the shows was an acoustic set, with Mike Lindup playing the accordion. In October 2012, on Mark King\'s birthday during a gig in Bristol, Boon Gould joined the band on stage.\r\n\r\n2013–present: \"Sirens\" EP series and re-engagement with contemporary dance-pop:\r\nOn 20 and 21 September 2013, Level 42 (joined by an expanded brass section), performed three new songs at London\'s Indigo O2 Arena – \"Where\'s Yo\' Head At\", \"Too Much Time\", and \"Sirens\". All of these appeared on the band\'s first new release for seven years, the six-song studio EP \"Sirens\" (released on 31 October 2013, and the first output from the band\'s new self-owned label Level 42 Records). Mixed by the American DJ John Morales, the EP also contained \"Mind on You\", \"My Independence Day\" and \"Build Myself a Rocket\" (with King\'s daughter Marlee providing the backing vocals on the last of these tracks).

They are one of the most enduring and successful bands that emerged during the 80s, particularly from the new wave/new romantic era. The band name is derived from a French fashion magazine, Dépêche mode, which means \"fashion dispatch.\" Also, from 2020 Depeche Mode is the most influential band in the world, having influenced hundreds of legendary bands like Rammstein, Nine Inch Nails, Linkin Park, Paradise Lost, Marilyn Manson or Lacuna Coil.\r\n\r\nThe band has been highly influential in the electronic dance music scene, especially synthpop, techno, and trance, partly due to their innovative work, recording techniques, and use of sampling. Their most successful album is arguably 1990\'s Violator, which reached the #2 position in the UK, #7 in the US, and sold over 8 million copies worldwide. The band has released a long series of high-charting singles over their three-decades long career. Enjoy the Silence is their most recognized song and one of history\'s most covered songs.\r\n\r\nThe original line-up was Dave Gahan, Martin L. Gore, Andy Fletcher, and Vince Clarke. In December 1981, Clarke left the band and later formed Yazoo, The Assembly, and Erasure. Alan Wilder joined the group initially in January 1982 as a live keyboardist but became an official member in December 1982. He left in mid-1995 to fully concentrate on his Recoil project, and the band continued as a trio. In 2010 Wilder re-joined Depeche Mode on stage after 16 years for a performance of Somebody during a show at London\'s Royal Albert Hall in aid of the Teenage Cancer Trust.\r\n\r\nDepeche Mode\'s origins date back to 1977, when Vince Clarke and Andrew Fletcher formed a band called No Romance in China, with Clarke on vocals and guitar and Fletcher on bass. In March 1980, Clarke, Gore, and Fletcher formed a band called Composition of Sound, with Clarke on vocals/guitar, Gore on keyboards, and Fletcher on bass. Soon after the formation of Composition of Sound, Clarke, and Fletcher switched to synthesizers. Dave Gahan joined the band in 1980 after Clarke heard him perform at a local scout hut jam session, singing to a rendition of David Bowie\'s \"Heroes\" and Depeche Mode was born. \r\n\r\nWhile playing a live gig at the Bridge House in Canning Town, Daniel Miller, the founder of Mute Records, approached the band, who proposed a verbal contract. The result was their first single,  Dreaming of Me, recorded in December 1980 and released in February 1981, reaching number 57 in the UK charts and followed soon by a real contract with Mute.\r\n\r\nTo date, Depeche Mode have released:\r\n15 studio albums: Speak & Spell (1981), A Broken Frame (1982), Construction Time Again (1983), Some Great Reward (1984), Black Celebration (1986), Music For the Masses (1987), Violator (1990), Songs of Faith and Devotion (1993), Ultra (1997), Exciter (2001), Playing the Angel (2005),  Sounds of the Universe (2009), Delta Machine (2013), Spirit (2017), and Memento Mori (2023);\r\n8 compilations: People Are People (1984), The Singles 81-85 (1985), Catching Up with Depeche Mode (1985), Greatest Hits (1987), The Singles 86>98 (1998), Remixes 81-04 (2004), The Best Of Depeche Mode Volume 1 (2006), The Complete Depeche Mode (2006);\r\n5 live albums: 101 (1989), Songs of Faith and Devotion Live (1993), Recording the Angel (a series of live recordings; 2006), Tour Of The Universe: Barcelona 20/21:11:09 (2009) and Live In Berlin (Soundtrack) (2014) ;\r\nOver 50 singles:  including Just Can\'t Get Enough, Everything Counts, People Are People, Master and Servant, Shake the Disease, Stripped, A Question of Time, Strangelove, Never Let Me Down Again, Personal Jesus, Enjoy the Silence, World in My Eyes, Policy of Truth, I Feel You, Walking in My Shoes, In Your Room, Barrel of a Gun, It\'s No Good, Home, Dream On, Freelove, Precious, Wrong and Heaven ;\r\n14 live / video collections (VHS/DVD/Blu-ray): The World We Live In and Live in Hamburg (1985), Some Great Videos (1985), Strange (1988), 101 (1989), Strange Too (1990), Devotional (1993), The Videos 86>98 (1998), One Night in Paris (2002), The Videos 86>98 (2002), Touring the Angel: Live in Milan (2006), The Best of - Volume 1 (2006), Tour of the Universe : Barcelona 20/21.11.09 (2009), Live in Berlin (2014) and Video Singles Collection (2016)  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Depeche+Mode\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Groundswell\'s line-up consisted of five members: Adam Gontier (vocals, guitar), Neil Sanderson (backing vocals, drums), Brad Walst (bass), Phil Crowe (guitar), and Joe Grant (guitar), all of whom were attending high school when the band formed.\r\n\r\nIn 1997, after being disbanded for two years, the band regrouped in Toronto as a trio consisting of Gontier, Sanderson, and Walst. They also changed their name to \"Three Days Grace\". According to Gontier, the name stands for the question: If you had three days to change something in your life, could you do it? Once in Toronto, the band became acquainted with local producer Gavin Brown. The band gave him several years of material that they had created since forming, and he \"picked out what he called \'the golden nuggets\'\", according to Gontier. Brown and the band polished the songs into a demo album which they gave to EMI Music Publishing Canada. The record label wanted to hear more material, and with Brown producing, the band created the song, \"I Hate Everything About You\", which attracted the interest of several record labels. The band was soon signed to Jive Records after being sought out by the company\'s president.\r\n\r\n\r\nThree Days Grace (2003 - 2005)\r\n\r\nAfter being signed to Jive, the band moved to Long View Farms, a studio in Boston, to record their debut album. The self-titled album was finished in Woodstock, New York and released on July 22, 2003. It was met with generally favorable reviews. Dave Doray of IGN said of the album, \"Mistakes? There\'s not many.\" Allmusic reviewer Heather Phares said that on Three Days Grace, \"the band\'s focus and adherence to alt-metal\'s formulas — coupled with tight songwriting and some unexpectedly pretty choruses — results in a strong tracks that are more memorable than the work of many of their peers\". She did criticize the album for its simplicity, concluding, \"Three Days Grace are definitely one of the most accessible alt-metal bands of the 2000s; they just need to add some more distinctiveness to their sound.\"\r\n\r\nAfter acquiring lead guitarist Barry Stock in late 2003, Three Days Grace toured continuously and extensively for almost two years in support of their major label debut. The album peaked at number nine on the Canadian Albums Chart and number 69 on the Billboard 200 and was certified platinum in the US by the RIAA in December 2004 and double platinum in Canada by the CRIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne-X (2006 - 2008)\r\n\r\nWhile touring in support of Three Days Grace, Gontier became depressed and addicted to drugs and alcohol. He went into rehab after the band finished touring, and while there, began writing material for the band\'s second album. After leaving rehab, he rejoined the band in a cottage in Ontario to finish writing material for the album. In a 2006 interview, Gontier said that the album\'s material was more personal to him than the band\'s previous release, being based on the despondence, drug abuse, and rehab that constituted the past two years of his life. The album, titled One-X, was then released on June 13, 2006, and was guitarist Barry Stock\'s recorded debut.\r\n\r\nOne-X was met with generally favorable reviews. The Toronto Star complimented the album with a review title of \"One CD worth buying...\" and focused on its lyrics, saying, \"The lyrics really speak out to you, especially if you\'re going through a tough time in your life.\" Allmusic reviewer Corey Apar praised the music, saying it \"remains catchy despite its lyrical darkness\". The album did receive some negative criticism. Apar pointed out that Three Days Grace is \"hardly innovative\" in their approach to writing music and that \"further distinctive qualities\" would help the band separate itself \"from their alt-metal peers\".\r\n\r\nOne-X peaked at number two on the Canadian album chart and at number five on the Billboard 200, selling 78,000 copies in the US in its first week of release. Its first single, \"Animal I Have Become\", was Three Days Grace\'s most successful, becoming 2006\'s most played rock song in Canada, and the album helped propel Three Days Grace to become the number one rock artist in airplay in the US and Canada in 2007, with Billboard ranking them as the number one rock artist of the year in 2007. One-X was certified platinum by the RIAA in the US on August 30, 2007, and double platinum by the CRIA in Canada in July 2007. Three Days Grace toured the US and Canada throughout the second half of 2006 and all of 2007 in support of One-X. In early 2008, they toured alongside Seether and Breaking Benjamin across the US\r\n\r\n\r\nLife Starts Now (2009 - 2011)\r\n\r\nFrom March to August 2008, to January to April 2009, Three Days Grace recorded their third album at The Warehouse Studio in Vancouver, British Columbia, and Los Angeles, with producer Howard Benson, who had worked with them on their previous releases. The album, entitled Life Starts Now, was released on September 22, 2009. Critics as well as band members have noted the album\'s departure from the angry tone of the band\'s previous releases into a lyrical style that comes off as more optimistic. According to guitarist Barry Stock, the album\'s theme centers around \"a new sense of freshness\" and the idea that \"you don\'t have to be stuck in whatever it is you\'re dealing with. Whether it\'s good or bad, it\'s your choice to make a change.\"\r\n\r\nLife Starts Now debuted at number three on the Billboard 200, Three Days Grace\'s highest chart position, and sold 79,000 copies in its first week. The album was met with mixed reviews. Ben Rayner of the Toronto Star gave the album a negative review, saying it possesses \"no sound of its own, just a shallow range between Linkin Park and Nickelback\". According to Allmusic reviewer James Christopher Monger, who gave the album three out of five stars, Life Starts Now continues the theme of One-X, Gontier\'s personal demons, but with a \"hint of sunlight\". He compliments the album, saying it \"treats the well-worn metal themes of anger, isolation, heartache, and redemption with the kind of begrudging respect they deserve, pumping out a competent flurry of fist-bump anthems and world-weary, midtempo rockers\".[32] Harsher negative reviews came from Ben Czajkowski from 411mania.com as he described the album as \"Boring, bland, trite, tired, tried, and true\".\r\n\r\nThe first single from the album, \"Break\", was released on September 1, 2009. Three Days Grace embarked on a 20-date Canadian tour lasting through November and December 2009.[36] They co-headlined a January–February 2010 tour of the US with Breaking Benjamin and Flyleaf.\r\nThey embarked on a US headlining tour with support from Chevelle, and Adelitas Way starting on March 26, 2010 in Grand Rapids, Michigan and ending on April 16, 2010 in Springfield, Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nThree Days Grace went on tour with Nickelback and Buckcherry on the Dark Horse Fall 2010 Tour. They toured with My Darkest Days starting in March 2011 in Seattle, Washington.[39] They also joined Avenged Sevenfold on their Spring \"Welcome to the Family\" tour in 2011.[citation needed] They toured with Avenged Sevenfold, Seether, Escape The Fate, and Bullet For My Valentine on the Rockstar Energy Drink Uproar tour from August 2011 to October 2011. It was their last album under Jive Records and their first album under Sony Music Entertainment after the Sony BMG joint venture ended, moving all former BMG labels to the new Sony Music Entertainment.\r\n\r\n\r\nTransit of Venus and Gontier\'s departure (2012 - present) \r\n\r\nOn October 7, 2011, RCA Music Group announced it was disbanding Jive Records along with Arista Records and J Records. With the shutdown, the band (and all other artists previously signed to these three labels) will release their future material (including their upcoming fourth studio album) on the RCA Records brand.\r\n\r\nOn June 5, 2012, at 9:00 A.M. PST, the same day as Venus\' visible transit across the sun, the band announced that their fourth studio album will be called Transit of Venus and that it is set to be released October 2, 2012. They created an early promotional video that was released on their website, featuring clips of them in the studio as well as footage of the physical transit of Venus. Due to the rarity of this occurrence, they created the slogan, \"some things will never happen again in your lifetime\", reflecting both this uncommon occurrence as well as the mood that the lyrics and music will most likely take on. The first single on the album, \"Chalk Outline\", was released August 14.\r\n\r\nOn January 9, 2013, Three Days Grace announced that Adam Gontier was resigning from the band. Brad\'s brother, Matt Walst of My Darkest Days, would be touring with the band as lead vocals. They cited Adam Gontier\'s sudden departure due to medical reasons.\r\n\r\nThree Days Grace kicked off their 2013 tour in Moline, IL with Matt Walst as touring lead singer; he later became a permanent member of the band.\r\n\r\nAwards\r\n\r\nThree Days Grace has been recognized for their musical efforts through several awards and nominations. In 2007, the band was ranked by Mediabase as the top artist in airplay across all rock formats in the US and Canada, and Billboard named them Rock Artist of the Year. Three Days Grace has been nominated for four Juno Awards. In 2004, the band was nominated for New Group of the Year.[49] \"I Hate Everything About You\" was nominated for Best Rock Video and People\'s Choice: Favourite Canadian Group at Much Music Awards. In 2007, they were nominated for Best Group of the Year, and their album One-X was nominated for Album of the Year.[51] The band\'s first single from One-X, \"Animal I Have Become\", was Canada\'s most played rock song in 2006 and won that year\'s Mediabase award for the most played rock song on radio. \"Never Too Late\" was nominated for Best Video and Best Rock Video and \"Pain\" was nominated for Best International Video by a Canadian and People\'s Choice: Favorite Canadian Group at Much Music Awards.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Life Starts Now was nominated for best Rock Album at the Juno awards but lost to Billy Talent III. In 2010, \"Break\" was nominated for Best Post Production Video and Best Rock Video of the year at Much Music Awards.On Fuse.tv. \"Break\" was nominated for \"Best Single\" and \"Life Starts Now\" won for \"Best Album\" at the Casby Awards.\r\n\r\n\r\nMusical style and influences\r\n\r\nThree Days Grace\'s musical style has generally been described by critics as alternative metal and hard rock throughout the band\'s career. Heather Phares of Allmusic, in a review of the band\'s debut album, compared them to rock bands Chevelle and Helmet. Dave Doray of IGN described Three Days Grace as \"heavy and catchy, with chewy chunks of assurance and fury thrown in for added measure.\" Allmusic\'s Corey Apar said One-X brings an \"accessible alt-metal attack of blunt lyrics and crunching rhythms\" that retains the melodic sound of its predecessor \"despite its lyrical darkness\".\r\n\r\nThe band has listed numerous influences in their music. Gontier has mentioned such bands as Sunny Day Real Estate, Kyuss, Nine Inch Nails, and Tool as influences for the band\'s music. According to Gontier, the lyrics for Three Days Grace songs have mostly been influenced by the Seattle music scene. He summarized about the band\'s influences in an interview, \"Musically there\'s a lot of different influences, but lyrically it\'s hard to have different influences because you just write.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBand members:\r\n\r\nCurrent Members\r\n\r\n* Matt Walst – lead vocals (2013-present)\r\n* Brad Walst – bass guitar, backing vocals (1997 - present)\r\n * Neil Sanderson – drums, backing vocals (1997 - present)\r\n * Barry Stock – lead guitar (2003 - present)\r\n\r\nFormer Members\r\n\r\n* Adam Gontier – lead vocals, rhythm guitar (1997–2013)\r\n\r\nLive Members\r\n\r\n* Dani Rosenoer  – piano, synthesizer, backing vocals (2012-present)\r\n\r\n\r\nThree Days Grace discography\r\n\r\n    * Three Days Grace (2003)\r\n    * One-X (2006)\r\n    * Life Starts Now (2009)\r\n    * Transit of Venus (2012)\r\n    * Human (2015)\r\n    * Outsider (2018)\r\n    * EXPLOSIONS (2022) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Three+Days+Grace\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Their Carnival Recording Company debut, Level, finds them poised to bust out of the Lone Star State and bring their brand of music to a wider audience as they make inroads into neighboring states and the wider Nashville country scene.\r\n\r\nThe band was formed almost five years ago by Mike Eli who grew up just outside of Houston and James Young who hails from Irving, TX. After playing together as a duo they were later joined by drummer Chris Thompson of Colleyville, TX and bassist Jon Jones of Omaha, NE who all met while students at the University of North Texas at Denton, about 50 miles north of Dallas/Forth Worth. After graduating the group decided to stay in Denton and to this day make their home in the town.\r\n\r\nLate in 2003 producer Frank Liddell (Jack Ingram, Miranda Lambert, Chris Knight) attended a show at the Gypsy Tea Room where EYB was playing on the bill with Miranda Lambert. He was blown away by the show and wound up signing them to Carnival Recording Company soon after. In April 2005, the Eli Young Band released Level, marking their debut on Carnival.\r\n\r\nLevel has drawn comparisons to The Jayhawks in the plaintive \"When It Rains\". The band members, all in their early 20s, have proven to be adept at blending their musical influences into a cohesive sound on this effort.

In 2008, they signed with Smith Entertainment and released their debut album, Road of Life. Their second album, Firewater, was released by Wiggy Thump in 2011 and debuted in the Top 30 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart.\r\n\r\nIn a modest rent house in the small East Texas town of Elkhart, Texas, Cody Cannon and Cody Tate began to write music, only dreaming of the success that is sure to follow. They began to incorporate the talent and imagination of friend and guitarist John Jeffers. At that time, they called themselves Lucky Southern, though they had only three members. As time passed, with their inspiration mounting, they moved to Tyler, Texas. There they met up with Jeff Hogg, a mutual friend and drummer from Palestine, Texas, and Gary Brown, a bass guitarist who had grown up in Neches, Texas. They came together and came to be known as Whiskey Myers.\r\n\r\nSoon, the group was playing private parties on flatbed trailers in small towns around East Texas. The sound they emitted was something more unique than anyone had expected. From their first show in Montalba, Texas, a young Whiskey Myers was hooked on performing, and the crowds were hooked on them. In the spring of 2007, they were given the opportunity to open for Roger Creager at Gator’s Bar and Grill in Gun Barrel City, Texas. The club owner was so impressed by their performance and the crowd that had come to the stage that he asked them to come back the next weekend to open for The Eli Young Band. From then on, popularity for the band began to swell. They were heard on live stages all over East Texas, in interviews on local radio stations, and seen on television giving live interviews. Suddenly it seemed that the whole region knew who Whiskey Myers was, and everyone was becoming familiar with their high energy twin guitars, soulful vocals, and unstoppable rhythm.\r\n\r\nWhiskey Myers’ musical style was forged from several different genres of music from several different eras. The most obvious of these are the blues rock jam bands such as Lynyrd Skynyrd, The Allman Brothers Band, and Led Zeppelin. Whiskey Myers takes the blues rock genre and mixes it with modern day Texas Country such as Reckless Kelly, Randy Rogers, and Cross Canadian Ragweed to derive a new sound that is sure to take concert listeners on an atmospheric roller coaster. With a sound like no other and a stage presence that captivates anyone close enough to notice, a live concert performed by this young band is something that must be seen to be believed.\r\n\r\nThe Tyler area has been instrumental in the development of Whiskey Myers from a group of musicians to a band. As the group continues to expand its fan base, new listeners all over Texas are beginning to recognize their talent.

Their third album Skinty Fia, released in 2022, became the band\'s first to reach number one on the UK Albums Chart and Irish Albums Chart. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Fontaines+D.C.\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The band has gone through several phases since its inception by former members of Santana. The band\'s greatest commercial success came in the late 1970s through the early 1980s with a series of power ballads and songs such as \"Don\'t Stop Believin\'\", \"Any Way You Want It\", \"Faithfully\", \"Open Arms\", \"Separate Ways\", and \"Wheel in the Sky\". \r\nJourney became eligible for induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2000, but were not inducted until 2017.  Members Jonathan Cain, Aynsley Dunbar, Steve Perry, Gregg Rolie, Neal Schon, Steve Smith and Ross Valory were included in the band\'s induction.  Rolie had previously been inducted as a member of parent band Santana. \r\nFormation, 1973–1976 \r\nThe original members of Journey came together in San Francisco in 1973 under the auspices of former Santana manager Herbie Herbert. Originally called the Golden Gate Rhythm Section and intended to serve as a backup group for established Bay Area artists, the band included recent Santana alumni Neal Schon on lead guitar and Gregg Rolie on keyboards and lead vocals. Drummer Prairie Prince of The Tubes, bassist Ross Valory and rhythm guitarist George Tickner, both of Frumious Bandersnatch, rounded out the group. The band quickly abandoned the original \"backup group\" concept and developed a distinctive jazz fusion style. After an unsuccessful radio contest to name the group, roadie John Villaneuva suggested the name \"Journey.\" The band\'s first public appearance came at the Winterland Ballroom on New Year’s Eve, 1973. Prairie Prince rejoined The Tubes shortly thereafter, and the band hired British drummer Aynsley Dunbar, who had recently worked with John Lennon and Frank Zappa. On February 5, 1974, the new line-up made their debut at the Great American Music Hall and secured a recording contract with Columbia Records. \r\nJourney released their eponymous first album in 1975, and rhythm guitarist Tickner left the band before they cut their second album, Look into the Future (1976). Neither album achieved significant sales, so Schon, Valory, and Dunbar took singing lessons in an attempt to add vocal harmonies to Rolie\'s lead. The following year\'s Next contained shorter tracks with more vocals and featured Schon as lead singer on several of the songs. \r\nNew musical direction, 1977–1980 \r\nJourney\'s album sales did not improve and Columbia Records requested that they change their musical style and add a frontman, with whom keyboardist Gregg Rolie could share lead vocal duties. The band hired Robert Fleischman and transitioned to a more popular style, akin to that of Foreigner and Boston. Journey went on tour with Fleischman in 1977 and the new incarnation of the band wrote several songs, including the later hit \"Wheel in the Sky\". But fans were lukewarm to the change, and personality and management differences resulted in Fleischman leaving the band within the year. \r\nIn the fall of 1977, Journey hired Steve Perry as their new lead singer. Perry added a clean, tenor sound and the band became a true pop act. Their fourth album, Infinity (1978) reached No. 21 on the album charts and gave the band their first RIAA-certified platinum album plus hit singles out of \"Lights\" and \"Wheel in the Sky\". \r\nDrummer Aynsley Dunbar did not get along with singer Steve Perry and did not approve of the new musical direction. He was fired in 1978 and replaced by Berklee-trained jazz drummer Steve Smith. Perry, Schon, Rolie, Smith, and bass player Ross Valory recorded 1979\'s Evolution, which gave the band their first Billboard Hot 100 Top 20 single, \"Lovin,\' Touchin,\' Squeezin\"; and 1980\'s Departure, which reached No. 8 on the album charts and included the top-25 hit \"Any Way You Want It\". \r\nJourney\'s newfound success brought the band an almost entirely new fan base. During the 1980 Departure world tour, the band recorded a live album, Captured. They also recorded the soundtrack to the film Dream, After Dream while in Japan. \r\nExhausted from extensive touring, keyboardist Gregg Rolie now left a successful band for the second time in his career. Keyboardist Stevie Roseman was brought in to record the lone studio track for Captured, \"The Party\'s Over (Hopelessly in Love)\", but Rolie recommended pianist Jonathan Cain of The Babys as the permanent replacement. With Cain\'s replacement of Rolie\'s Hammond B-3 organ with his own synthesizers, the band was poised to redefine rock music for a new decade in which they would achieve their greatest musical success. \r\nHeight of popularity, 1981–1983 \r\nJourney released their eighth and biggest-selling studio album, Escape, in 1981. The album, which is a Diamond bestseller (10 million+ sales), went to number one on the album charts that year, and included three top-ten hits: \"Who\'s Crying Now\", \"Don\'t Stop Believin\'\", and \"Open Arms\". \r\nCapitalizing on their success, the band recorded radio commercials for Budweiser and sold rights to their likenesses and music for use in two video games: the Journey arcade game by Bally/Midway and Journey Escape by Data Age for the Atari 2600. \r\nThis success was met with piqued criticism. The 1983 Rolling Stone Record Guide gave each of the band\'s albums only one star, with Dave Marsh writing that \"Journey was a dead end for San Francisco area rock\". Marsh later would anoint Escape as one of the worst number-one albums of all time. \r\nJourney\'s next album, 1983\'s Frontiers, continued their commercial success, reaching No. 2 on the album charts. Four hit singles included \"Separate Ways\", which reached #8, and \"Faithfully\", which reached #12. During the subsequent tour, the band contracted with NFL Films to record a video documentary of their life on the road, Frontiers and Beyond. \r\nBreak-up, 1984–1994 \r\nLead singer Steve Perry and guitarist Neal Schon both pursued solo projects between 1982 and 1985, and when they returned to Journey to record their 1986 album Raised on Radio, bass player Ross Valory and drummer Steve Smith were fired from the band for musical and professional differences. Studio musicians handled the two vacant slots, including future American Idol judge Randy Jackson and established session player Larrie Londin. The album sold two million copies. A truncated tour followed, which featured Jackson on bass and Mike Baird on drums. Steve Perry left Journey in 1987. \r\nNeal Schon and Jonathan Cain teamed up with Cain\'s ex-Babys bandmates John Waite and Ricky Phillips, forming Bad English with drummer Deen Castronovo in 1988. Steve Smith started a jazz band, Vital Information, and teamed up with Ross Valory and Gregg Rolie to create The Storm with singer Kevin Chalfant and guitarist Josh Ramos. \r\nReunions, 1991, 1995–1997 \r\nBetween 1987 and 1995, Journey\'s record label released three compilations. On November 3, 1991, Journey (minus drummer Steve Smith and bassist Ross Valory) reunited to perform at the Laughter, Love, and Music concert, a free concert dedicated to Bill Graham who died in a helicopter crash the same year. This is currently the last live performance with Steve Perry. In October, 1993, Kevin Chalfant (of The Storm) performed with Neal Schon and Jonathan Cain at a roast for manager Herbie Herbert for the Thunder Road benefit. After that, Schon, Cain, Valory, Smith and Rolie briefly considered reuniting the band with Chalfant as lead singer. But in 1995 Steve Perry agreed to rejoin the band on the condition that they seek new management. Herbie Herbert was fired and Eagles manager Irving Azoff retained. \r\nIn 1995, Perry, Schon, Cain, Valory, and Smith reunited to record Trial by Fire. Released in 1996, the album included the hit single \"When You Love a Woman\", which reached #12 on the Billboard charts and was nominated in 1997 for a Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. \r\nPlans for a subsequent tour ended when Perry injured his hip hiking in Hawaii in the summer of 1997 and could not perform without hip replacement surgery — which he refused to undergo. In 1998, Schon and Cain decided to seek a new lead singer, at which point drummer Steve Smith left the band as well. \r\nLead singer replaced, 1998–2006 \r\nIn 1998, Journey hired drummer Deen Castronovo, Schon\'s and Cain\'s Bad English bandmate, and drummer for Hardline, to replace Steve Smith. The lead vocalist position was filled by Steve Augeri, formerly of Tyketto and Tall Stories. \r\nThat same year, Journey with Steve Augeri and Deen Castronovo recorded a track for the soundtrack to the movie Armageddon called \"Remember Me\". The band released their next studio album, Arrival, in Japan in late 2000 and in the United States in 2001. \"All the Way\" became a minor adult contemporary hit from the album. In 2002, the band released a four-track CD titled \"Red 13\", with an album cover design chosen through a fan contest. In 2005, the band was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame, embarked on their 30th anniversary tour, and released their twelfth full-length studio album, Generations, in which each band member performed lead vocals on at least one song. \r\nLead singer replaced again, 2006–present \r\nIn July 2006, Steve Augeri was dropped from the band while they toured with Def Leppard, with the official statement citing a \'chronic throat infection\' as the problem. Augeri had been suffering from vocal attrition problems since 2003 and Journey had been using pre-recorded lead vocals. The band hired singer Jeff Scott Soto from Talisman to fill in, and Soto officially replaced Augeri as Journey\'s lead singer in December 2006. On June 12, 2007, Journey announced that Soto was no longer the lead singer, and said that they were looking to move in a new direction. \r\nIn December 2007, after briefly considering the lead singer of a Virginia-based tribute band, Journey hired Filipino singer Arnel Pineda of the cover band The Zoo after Neal Schon saw him on YouTube singing covers of Journey songs. Journey debuted their new lead singer in February 2008 in Chile, released the album Revelation, and announced a summer tour with Heart and Cheap Trick. Revelation debuted at #5 on the Billboard charts, selling more than 196,000 units in its first two weeks, making it the band\'s best selling album since Trial by Fire.  \r\nAlthough Pineda was not the first foreign national to become a member of Journey (former drummer Aynsley Dunbar is British) nor even the first non-white (former bass player Randy Jackson is Black), the transition was difficult for a number of fans who expressed what Marin Independent Journal writer Paul Liberatore called \"an undercurrent of racism.\" Keyboardist Jonathan Cain responded to such sentiments: \"We\'ve become a world band. We\'re international now. We\'re not about one color.\" \r\nOn February 16, 2022, the band announced the title and track listing of their upcoming fifteenth studio album Freedom which was released later in the year. On March 1, 2022, Cain confirmed that both Walden and Jackson were no longer part of the lineup \r\nDiscography: \r\nJourney (1975) \r\nLook into the Future (1976) \r\nNext (1977) \r\nInfinity (1978) \r\nEvolution (1979) \r\nDeparture (1980) \r\nEscape (1981) \r\nFrontiers (1983) \r\nRaised on Radio (1986) \r\nTrial by Fire (1996) \r\nArrival (2001) \r\nGenerations (2005) \r\nRevelation (2008) \r\nEclipse (2011) \r\nFreedom (2022)  \r\n\r\n2)  UK Based psychedelic trance producer Giampiero \"Jay\" Mastino studied Sound Engineering and Music Technology in 2003 and soon thereafter began solo production under the name Journey, and in collaboration with Anton Petrov as Star~Trip. In 2009 he also started a new progressive project under the name OM.  Jay also DJ\'s under the name Jay OM. \r\nIn 2004, he conceived the vision of a network of like-minded artists in the psy-trance and ambient genres, all working to promote themselves and each other under one banner. Thus the Free-Spirit Records label was born... Originally intended to focus on artist management, the label\'s skyrocketing success combined with the enthusiasm of Jay, the artists, and fans enabled Free-Spirit to outgrow its horizons. Free-Spirit continues to build a collective of artists and djs from around the globe, aiming to create and provide access to a combined set of resources not available to them as individuals, making it just a little easier for all to concentrate on what they truly love, which is the music! \r\nFree-Spirit Vol.1 \"Brahamaputra\", the debut release for Free-Spirit Records compiled by Jay OM, hit the shops in October 2006, featuring both a Journey and a Star~Trip track amongst others and Christopher Lawrence (ranked No. 4 DJ in the world) featured Journey\'s Spotless mind in his Top 10 in December 2006. Free-Spirit Vol.2 \"Eupsychia\" followed in June 2007 with 2 more tracks from Journey and Star~Trip and in 2008 a another 3 releases on Free-Spirit Vol.3 \"Neophilia\" and V/A Children of Jah (Revolve Magazine). 2009 saw the release of Journey\'s highly anticipated debut solo Album \"The Man who Sold the Time\" as well as further releases on various V/A Compilations on Mutagen, Antu, Solar Tech. Catalyst, Alchemy and Free-Spirit Records.  Jay is currently working  on his 2nd Journey solo album. \r\nToday, Jay\'s reputation as an active, involved, and hard working individual in the global trance circuit precedes him. His commitment and enthusiasm for trance music has left an indelible impression on the world scene already, and Jay\'s future has never looked brighter, from his burgeoningly successful record label to his organized events in the UK, to his upcoming solo releases.  Jay works tirelessly at his art and trade and the music he brings to the masses exemplifies the fruits of his labour and energy. \r\n\r\n3) Journey is an underground hip hop artist. \"Rare Dope Wave\" was released in 2021. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Journey\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The band consists of Matt Bellamy (lead vocals, guitar, keyboards), Chris Wolstenholme (bass guitar, backing vocals), and Dominic Howard (drums). They released their debut album, Showbiz, in 1999, showcasing Bellamy\'s falsetto and a melancholic alternative rock style. Their second album, Origin of Symmetry (2001), incorporated wider instrumentation and romantic classical influences and earned them a reputation for energetic live performances. Absolution (2003) saw further classical influence, with strings on tracks such as \"Butterflies and Hurricanes\", and was the first of seven consecutive UK number-one albums.\r\n\r\nBlack Holes and Revelations (2006) incorporated electronic and pop elements, displayed in singles such as \"Supermassive Black Hole\", and brought Muse wider international success. The Resistance (2009) and The 2nd Law (2012) explored themes of government oppression and civil uprising and cemented Muse as one of the world\'s major stadium acts. Rolling Stone stated the band possessed \"stadium-crushing songs\". Topping the US Billboard 200, their seventh album, Drones (2015), was a concept album about drone warfare and returned to a harder rock sound. Their eighth album, Simulation Theory (2018), prominently featured synthesisers and was influenced by science fiction and the simulation hypothesis. Their ninth album, Will of the People (2022), which combined many genres and themes from their previous albums, was released in August 2022.\r\n\r\nMuse have won numerous awards, including two Grammy Awards, two Brit Awards, five MTV Europe Music Awards and eight NME Awards.

The band\'s lineup—consisting of lead vocalist Till Lindemann, lead guitarist Richard Kruspe, rhythm guitarist Paul Landers, bassist Oliver Riedel, drummer Christoph Schneider, and keyboardist Christian \"Flake\" Lorenz—has remained unchanged throughout their history, along with their approach to songwriting, which consists of Lindemann writing and singing the lyrics over instrumental pieces the rest of the band has completed beforehand. Prior to their formation, some members were associated with the punk rock acts Feeling B and First Arsch.\r\n\r\nAfter winning a local contest, Rammstein was able to record demos and send them to different record labels, eventually signing with Motor Music. Working with producer Jacob Hellner, they released their debut album Herzeleid in 1995. Though the album initially sold poorly, the band gained popularity through their live performances and the album eventually reached No. 6 in Germany. Their second album, Sehnsucht, was released in 1997 and debuted at No. 1 in Germany, resulting in a worldwide tour lasting nearly four years and spawning the successful singles \"Engel\" and \"Du hast\" and the live album Live aus Berlin (1999). Following the tour, Rammstein signed with major label Universal Music and released Mutter in 2001. Six singles were released from the album, all charting in countries throughout Europe. The lead single, \"Sonne\", reached No. 2 in Germany. Rammstein released Reise, Reise in 2004 and had two more singles reach No. 2 in Germany: \"Mein Teil\" and \"Amerika\"; the former song reached No. 1 in Spain, becoming their first No. 1 single.\r\nf\r\nTheir fifth album, Rosenrot, was released in 2005, and the lead single, \"Benzin\", reached No. 6 in Germany. Their second live album, Völkerball, was released in 2006. The band released their sixth album, Liebe ist für alle da, in 2009, with its lead single, \"Pussy\", becoming their first No. 1 hit in Germany despite having a controversial music video that featured hardcore pornography. The band then entered a recording hiatus and toured for several years, releasing the Made in Germany greatest hits album as well as the Rammstein in Amerika and Paris live albums. After a decade without new music, Rammstein returned in 2019 with the song \"Deutschland\", which became their second No. 1 hit in Germany. Their untitled seventh studio album was released in May 2019 and reached No. 1 in 14 countries. While sheltering during COVID-19 lockdowns, the band spontaneously wrote and recorded their eighth studio album, Zeit, which was released in April 2022.\r\n\r\nRammstein was one of the first bands to emerge within the Neue Deutsche Härte genre, with their debut album leading the music press to coin the term, and their style of music has generally had a positive reception from music critics. Commercially, the band has been very successful, earning many No. 1 albums as well as gold and platinum certifications in countries around the world. Their grand live performances, which often feature pyrotechnics, have contributed to the growth in their popularity. Despite success, the band has been subject to some controversies, with their overall image having been criticized; for instance, the song \"Ich tu dir weh\" forced its parent album Liebe ist für alle da to be re-released in Germany with the song removed due to its sexually explicit lyrics.\r\n\r\nMusical style and lyrics\r\nRammstein is considered a Neue Deutsche Härte band, and is also often described as industrial metal. Other descriptions include hard rock and gothic metal, as well as nu metal, alternative metal, symphonic metal, progressive metal, and \"techno metal\". Rammstein was traditionally inspired by bands such as the Slovenian group Laibach, known for its provocative songs, often citing political symbols of the far-right and whose music style also combines different genres, or the German rock band Oomph! However, the band members don\'t see a real connection to Laibach – apart from the similarity in vocal style which Flake Lorenz admitted in a Viva interview from 1997. In the same interview Richard Kruspe said: \"For me, Laibach is a very, very intellectual story. Rammstein is much more emotional for me – in the beginning. And I can\'t do anything with that intellect that Laibach uses.\"\r\n\r\nLive performances\r\nSince their early years, Rammstein are particularly known for their over-the-top live performances, making such extensive use of pyrotechnics that fans eventually coined the motto, \"Other bands play, Rammstein burns!\". Following an accident in Berlin on 27 September 1996, in which some burning decorative parts of the stage collapsed, the band started using professionals to handle the pyrotechnics. Lindemann subsequently qualified as a licensed pyrotechnician, and often spends entire songs engulfed in flames. He has suffered multiple burns on his ears, head, and arms.\r\n\r\nThe band\'s stage costumes are also known for being outlandish. During the Reise, Reise Tour, they wore lederhosen, corsets, and military-inspired uniforms with German steel helmets; during the Mutter Tour, the group kept to the themes of the album artwork and descended onto the stage from a giant uterus while wearing diapers. During the Völkerball concert, among others, Lindemann changed costumes between songs and dressed accordingly for each. For example, for the song \"Mein Teil\", he was dressed as a blood-soaked chef; in \"Reise, Reise\", he dressed as a sailor. The rest of the band each wore their own preferred costume, but none quite as bizarre as Till\'s. The band\'s flair for costumes is evident in their music videos as well as their live shows. In the \"Keine Lust\" video, all members except Lorenz are dressed in fat suits. In the \"Amerika\" video, all members of the band wear astronaut costumes.\r\n\r\nSince the Mutter Tour in 2001, Rammstein have worked with stage designer Roy Bennett, who helped the band in developing the look of the stages. With the Ahoi Tour in 2004/2005, the band began using a two-level stage, with half the band playing the lower level and the other half on the upper level. At this tour, the upper level rose over 2 meters above the stage floor and had an oval entrance just beneath the drums. At both sides of the upper level, a special lift made it possible for the band members to access both stage levels.\r\n\r\nOn the Liebe ist für alle da Tour in 2009, the new stage still had a two-level design. This time, however, the upper level only had about half the height as on the previous tour. Stage entrance was possible by a hydraulic ramp in the middle of the stage floor. At each end of the upper level, stairs were placed in order to gain access to both levels. This tour included not only the extensive use of pyrotechnics, but also a massive lighting show, such as the band\'s logo lit up as big lamps on four enormous collapsible towers, forming the industrial backdrop of the set and being capable of different lighting effects.\r\n\r\nDuring the arena shows of the Made in Germany 1995-2011 Tour, the stage was slightly altered with new set pieces such as a large industrial fan as well as new backdrops. The most noticeable addition was a long catwalk, connecting the main stage to a smaller stage in the middle of the audience. During the 2013 festival leg of the tour, the bridge and smaller stage were omitted. For the 2016 Festival Tour, the band kept the stage itself mostly unchanged, though had the entire lighting rig changed completely. According to Kruspe, the onstage antics are meant to get people\'s attention and have fun at the same time; Rammstein\'s motto, according to Schneider, is \"do your own thing and overdo it\"\r\n\r\nMembers\r\nSince forming in 1994, Rammstein have retained a constant line-up. Richard Kruspe had said in a Revolver Magazine interview that it is because of the band respecting each other\'s wishes to take a break, either for personal reasons or to focus on a side project. Members of the band have had side projects that they take part in during Rammstein\'s inactivity.

Their music incorporates elements of alternative rock, funk, punk rock and psychedelic rock. The band consists of co-founders Anthony Kiedis (lead vocals) and Flea (bass), as well as drummer Chad Smith, and guitarist John Frusciante, the latter of whom has been in the band across three stints. With over 100 million records sold worldwide, Red Hot Chili Peppers is one of the best-selling bands of all time. They are the most successful band in the history of alternative rock, with the records for most number-one singles (13), most cumulative weeks at number one (85) and most top-ten songs (25) on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart.

Due to commitments to other bands, Slovak and Irons did not play on the band\'s 1984 self-titled debut album, which instead featured guitarist Jack Sherman and drummer Cliff Martinez. Slovak rejoined for their second album, Freaky Styley (1985), and Irons for their third, The Uplift Mofo Party Plan (1987). Irons left after Slovak died of a drug overdose in June 1988.\r\n\r\nWith new recruits Frusciante and Smith, Red Hot Chili Peppers recorded Mother\'s Milk (1989) and their first major commercial success, Blood Sugar Sex Magik (1991). Frusciante was uncomfortable with their newfound popularity and left abruptly on tour in 1992. After a series of temporary guitarists, he was replaced by Dave Navarro, who appeared on the group\'s sixth album, One Hot Minute (1995). Although successful, the album failed to match the critical or popular acclaim of Blood Sugar Sex Magik. Frusciante and Kiedis struggled with drug addiction throughout the 1990s.\r\n\r\nIn 1998, following Navarro\'s departure, Frusciante rejoined the band. Their seventh album,  Californication (1999), became their biggest commercial success, with 16 million copies sold worldwide. By the Way (2002) and Stadium Arcadium (2006) were also successful;  Stadium Arcadium was their first album to reach number one on the Billboard 200 chart. Frusciante left again in 2009 to focus on his solo career; he was replaced by Josh Klinghoffer, who appeared on I\'m with You (2011) and The Getaway (2016), before Frusciante rejoined in 2019. They released their 12th album, Unlimited Love, in 2022.\r\n\r\nRed Hot Chili Peppers\' mix of hard rock, funk and hip hop has influenced genres such as funk metal, rap metal, rap rock and nu metal. Kiedis said the band were early to combine \"hardcore funk and hip-hop-style vocals\", and suggested they had influenced Limp Bizkit, Kid Rock, and Linkin Park. Smith said, \"Certainly Anthony\'s singing style and voice lends itself to being unique, and nobody sounds like him. The cool thing about it is we can play any style of music whether it\'s hard and fast, or loud or quiet, slow or medium, whatever it is; rock or funk, and it still sounds like us. I\'m proud of that because sometimes bands don\'t have that strong personality where you go, \'Oh, that\'s boom, right away.\'\"\r\n\r\nRed Hot Chili Peppers was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame In April 2012. The induction lineup was Kiedis, Flea, Smith, Klinghoffer, Frusciante, Slovak (represented by his brother James), Irons and Martinez; Frusciante was invited, but did not attend. Navarro and Sherman were not inducted; Sherman said he felt \"dishonored\". The band performed \"By the Way\", \"Give It Away\" and \"Higher Ground\", which included Irons and Martinez on drums. It was the first time Kiedis and Flea had performed with Irons in more than 20 years.\r\n\r\nIn 2003, Rolling Stone released their first list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\", with Blood Sugar Sex Magik at 310 and Californication at 399. In 2012, a revised list was released, with Californication at 401. In 2020, Rolling Stone released another version of the list, with  Blood Sugar Sex Magik at 186 and Californication at 286.\r\n\r\nThe band received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on March 31, 2022 <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Red+Hot+Chili+Peppers\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Reggae-rockers, Tropidelic, untie the knots of expectation and sow together hip-hop, funk and ska in a seamless display of unbridled realism, pulling from an amalgamation of influence never before seen in the cold Midwest. The end result is an in-your-face party suited for the laid back festival-goer as much as the aggressive listener or seasoned music enthusiast. Their prowess and allure have landed them on shows and festivals like Warped Tour and Florida Music Festival, as well as with acts as diverse as The Wailers, George Clinton, The Blue Man Group, Pepper, OAR, Badfish, Afroman, Passafire, Ballyhoo and many more. The group has been featured on 96.5 KISS, 92.3 WKRK, 88.9 WSTB, 88.7 WJCU, & 91.3 WAPS. Their music has been used in many films and videos including a video for pro-surfer Holly Beck.

The band was formed in 1981 in Los Angeles by vocalist/guitarist James Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich, and has been based in San Francisco for most of its career. The band\'s fast tempos, instrumentals and aggressive musicianship made them one of the founding \"big four\" bands of thrash metal, alongside Megadeth, Anthrax and Slayer. Metallica\'s current lineup comprises founding members and primary songwriters Hetfield and Ulrich, longtime lead guitarist Kirk Hammett and bassist Robert Trujillo. Guitarist Dave Mustaine, who formed Megadeth after being fired from the band, and bassists Ron McGovney, Cliff Burton and Jason Newsted are former members of the band.\r\n\r\nMetallica first found commercial success with the release of its third album, Master of Puppets (1986), which is cited as one of the heaviest metal albums and the band\'s best work. The band\'s next album, ...And Justice for All (1988), gave Metallica its first Grammy Award nomination. Its self-titled fifth album, Metallica (1991), was the band\'s first not to root predominantly in thrash metal; it appealed to a more mainstream audience, achieving substantial commercial success and selling over 16 million copies in the United States to date, making it the best-selling album of the SoundScan era. After experimenting with different genres and directions in subsequent releases, Metallica returned to its thrash metal roots with the release of its ninth album, Death Magnetic (2008), which drew similar praise to that of the band\'s earlier albums. This was followed by the band\'s 10th studio album, Hardwired... to Self-Destruct (2016), with its 11th album, 72 Seasons, releasing in 2023.\r\n\r\nIn 2000, Metallica led the case against the peer-to-peer file sharing service Napster, in which the band and several other artists filed lawsuits against the service for sharing their copyright-protected material without consent, eventually reaching a settlement. Metallica was the subject of the acclaimed 2004 documentary film Metallica: Some Kind of Monster, which documented the troubled production of the band\'s eighth album, St. Anger (2003), and the internal struggles within the band at the time. In 2009, Metallica was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The band co-wrote the screenplay for and starred alongside Dane DeHaan in the 2013 concert film Metallica: Through the Never, in which the band performed live against a fictional thriller storyline.\r\n\r\nMetallica has released 10 studio albums, four live albums (including two performances with the San Francisco Symphony), 12 video albums, a cover album, two extended plays, 37 singles and 39 music videos. The band has won nine Grammy Awards from 23 nominations, and its last six studio albums (beginning with Metallica) have consecutively debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. Metallica ranks as one of the most commercially successful bands of all time, having sold over 125 million albums worldwide as of 2018. Metallica has been listed as one of the greatest artists of all time by magazines such as Rolling Stone, which ranked the band No. 61 on its 100 Greatest Artists of All Time list. As of 2017, Metallica is the third-best-selling music artist since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales in 1991, selling a total of 58 million albums in the United States.\r\n\r\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallica\r\n\r\nStudio albums\r\nKill \'Em All (1983)\r\nRide the Lightning (1984)\r\nMaster of Puppets (1986)\r\n...And Justice for All (1988)\r\nMetallica (1991)\r\nLoad (1996)\r\nReload (1997)\r\nSt. Anger (2003)\r\nDeath Magnetic (2008)\r\nHardwired... to Self-Destruct (2016)\r\n72 Seasons (2023) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Metallica\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The band consists of Alex Turner (vocals, guitar, piano), Jamie Cook (guitar), Nick O\'Malley (backing vocals, bass) and Matt Helders (drums, vocals). Founding bassist Andy Nicholson left in 2006.\r\n\r\nThe band has released seven studio albums: Whatever People Say I Am, That\'s What I\'m Not (2006), Favourite Worst Nightmare (2007), Humbug (2009), Suck It and See (2011), AM (2013), Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino (2018) and The Car (2022) (the first six of which debuted at #1 on the UK Albums Chart.\r\n\r\nEach of the band\'s first five singles \"I Bet You Look Good On the Dancefloor\", \"When the Sun Goes Down\", \"Leave Before The Lights Come On\", \"Brianstorm\" and \"Fluorescent Adolescent\" hit the UK Top Five, but their sixth single, \"Teddy Picker\", only went Top 20 and their seventh single, \"Crying Lightning\" peaked at #12.\r\n\r\nThe band\'s rise to success started in late 2004/early 2005 when demo songs that had been handed out in CD form at gigs found their way onto the internet. These demos rapidly spread among message boards and friends leading to a growing fan base for the band, and were collected on the unofficial Beneath the Boardwalk, which the band recognizes on their website.  The band owe much of their success to viral buzz via the Internet, and have eschewed typical \'commercial\' channels, including refusing to appear on the UK\'s (now discontinued) Top Of The Pops music program, which was often seen as a gateway to success.\r\n\r\nThe band\'s debut album, Whatever People Say I Am, That\'s What I\'m Not, held the record for the largest first week sales of a debut album in the UK (in its first week, it sold more than the rest of the Top 20 albums combined). The album sold over 360,000 copies in its first week, but lost the title in November 2007 to Leona Lewis\'s album Spirit.\r\n\r\nOn 19th June 2006 the band officially announced that founding member and bassist Andy Nicholson had left the band after missing the American leg of their tour due to \'fatigue\' and the other band members couldn\'t stand the constant \'missing his girlfriend syndrome\' so they told him to sling his hook. Former Dodgems bassist Nick O\'Malley was initially brought in as a stand-in, and played the band\'s remaining summer commitments. He was then announced as Nicholson\'s permanent replacement. \r\n\r\nThe single \"Leave Before The Lights Come On\" came out on August 14th, but only reached Number 4 on the UK charts, denying the band a third consecutive number 1 single.\r\n\r\nTheir debut album Whatever People Say I Am, That\'s What I\'m Not won the 2006 Mercury Prize, was chosen as the best album of year 2006 by Q Magazine, and received a slew of other accolades.\r\n\r\nTheir second album Favourite Worst Nightmare was released on April 23rd 2007. It was preceded by \"Brianstorm\", the first single from the album, which was released a week before. Like its predecessor, \"Favourite Worst Nightmare\" sold more than the rest of the Top 20 combined, and - due to an error on iTunes - every song on the record appeared on the UK Top 200 Singles the next week.\r\n\r\nWhen asked about Favourite Worst Nightmare Turner commented, \"We haven\'t changed that much. It\'s still about making contact with girls or not making contact with girls\".\r\n\r\nThe band began to write and record demos for the third album in January 2008, Turner said \"We had tunes that we\'d already been playing on tour so we recorded them. That’s six [songs]. We’re going to take it easy and start practicing over the summer and doing new stuff.\"\r\n\r\nThe band premiered new material from the unreleased album during their January 2009 tour of New Zealand, playing small venues in Wellington and Auckland ahead of the Big Day Out festival. Their first show in more than a year was on January 13, 2009 at Wellington\'s Town Hall. In both cities, the new songs played were \"Crying Lightning\", \"Go-Kart\", \"Dangerous Animals\" and \"Pretty Visitors.\" The full setlist from the Auckland gig is available online. Also played was a cover of the Nick Cave song \"Red Right Hand.\" During their last tour, the band had played new songs \"Put Me In A Terror Pocket\", \"Sandtrap,\" and \"The Fire and The Thud\" live.\r\n\r\nLead singer/songwriter Alex Turner started a two-man project with the singer from the Rascals, Miles Kane.\r\nThe band is called \'The Last Shadow Puppets\'\r\n\r\nThe Arctic Monkeys band released their album Humbug in August of 2009, preceded by the single \"Crying Lightning\"\r\n\r\nThey released their fourth studio album, Suck It And See, on June 6th, 2011.\r\n\r\nThey released their fifth studio album, AM, on September 9th, 2013.\r\n\r\nThey released their sixth studio album, Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino, with no preceding single releases, on May 11th, 2018.\r\n\r\nThey released their seventh studio album, The Car, on October 21st, 2022, preceded by the singles \"There\'d Better Be a Mirrorball\", \"Body Paint\" and \"I Ain\'t Quite Where I Think I Am\".\r\n\r\nhttp://www.arcticmonkeys.com/ <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Arctic+Monkeys\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986 and the Country Music Hall Of Fame in 2022. his pioneering contribution to the genre has been recognized by the Rockabilly Hall of Fame. His nickname is The Killer.\r\n\r\nLike Elvis Presley, he was raised singing the Christian gospel music of integrated southern Pentecostal churches. In 1950 he attended Southwestern Bible Institute in Texas but was expelled for misconduct, including playing rock and roll versions of hymns in church. Pearry Green (then president of the student body) related how during a talent show Jerry played some worldly music. The next morning the Dean of the school called both Jerry and Pearry into his office to expel them both. Jerry then said that Pearry shouldn\'t be expelled because \"he didn\'t know what I was going to do.\"  Years later Pearry asked Jerry: \"Are you still playing the devil\'s music?\" Jerry replied, \"Yes, I am. But you know it\'s strange, the same music that they kicked me out of school for is the same kind of music they play in their churches today. The difference is, I know I am playing for the devil and they don\'t.\"\r\n\r\nLeaving religious music behind, he became a part of the burgeoning new rock and roll sound, cutting his first record in 1954. Two years later, at Sun Records studio in Memphis, Tennessee, producer and engineer Jack Clement discovered and recorded Lewis for the Sun label, while owner Sam Phillips was away on a trip to Florida. As a result, Lewis joined Elvis Presley, Roy Orbison, Carl Perkins, and Johnny Cash as stars who began their recording careers at Sun Studios around this same time.\r\n\r\n \r\nLewis\' first recording at Sun studios was his own distinct version of the country ballad Crazy Arms. In 1957, his piano and the pure rock and roll sound of Whole Lotta Shakin\' Goin\' On propelled him to international fame. Great Balls of Fire soon followed, and would become his biggest hit. Watching and listening to Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis said if he could play the piano like that, he\'d quit singing. Lewis\' early billing was Jerry Lee Lewis and his Pumping Piano.\r\n\r\nLewis was a pioneer of piano rock, not only through his sound by also through his dynamic performance. He would often kick the piano bench out of the way to play standing, rake his hands up and down the keyboard for dramatic accent, and even sit down on it. His frenetic performance style can be seen in films such as High School Confidential (he sang the title song from the back of a flatbed truck), and Jamboree. These performance techniques have been adopted by recent piano rock artists, notably admirer Elton John. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Jerry+Lee+Lewis\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Made up of Christo Bowman (vocals), Gavin Bennett (bass), Miles Morris (drums) and Ray Libby (guitar) the four piece ranges from ages 19-22 yet has a sound reminiscent of rock stalwarts from generations past. “I grew up with a lot of world music playing in the house. When I was 10, I started getting heavily interested in the guitar, and my dad began introducing me to his records from the 70’s and the 80’s. Initially Elvis Costello, then to The Clash, The Cure, and so on,” notes Christo. “All of these artists and bands had a big impact on me, at a young age, as far as song composition goes. “ Influences are apparent on the band’s debut EP Transpose, where angst-ridden riffs and ethereal yet charismatic vocals pay tribute to post-punk legends of the early 80’s. “ I started writing my first songs at that time,” Christo continues, “Though we can now reflect on that era of music, those artists were ahead of their time in a lot of ways. That’s what’s most inspiring.”\r\n\r\nTranspose was recorded in the studio with producer Eric Palmquist (The Mars Volta, Wavves, Trash Talk) and serves as a prelude to the band’s debut full-length slated for 2014. “The writing and recording process is always exciting, because it’s constantly changing and unique to each song. Inspiration comes and goes as it pleases, so a night when a song gets written is a very good night,” says Christo. Comprised of four tracks, Transpose flows effortlessly from start to finish showcasing the band’s stadium ready anthems and undeniably catchy hooks. “Music has the ability to evoke certain feelings in people, a way that not much else can. The pairing of words and sounds can be an extremely powerful tool, when done right. I think the ultimate goal for this band is to make music that causes people to really feel something.”\r\n\r\nAside from writing a record, Bad Suns’ 2013 was a busy one, complete with multiple CMJ showcases as well as sharing the stage with the likes of The 1975 and Vaccines with no signs of slowing down any time soon. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bad+Suns\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

With layers of keyboards, Palace deliver a heavier sound than most in the genre, with guitars a dominating feature. Swirling keyboards, layers of guitars, and fast moving 80’s themed melodic hard rock is what is on offer on “Binary Music”. After the very warm reception of the debut album, ”Master Of The Universe”, Michael was very excited to get to work on the follow up and face the challenges that came with it. ”I wanted to make an album that will give the fans even more of what they enjoyed the last time around, all the while staying creative and not shying away from new musical ideas,” he says.

ICP has earned two platinum and five gold albums. According to Nielsen SoundScan, the entire catalog of the group has sold 6.5 million units in the United States and Canada as of April 2007. The group has established a dedicated following called Juggalos numbering in the \"tens of thousands\".\r\n\r\nFounded in Detroit in 1989, Insane Clown Posse performs a style of hardcore hip hop known as horrorcore and is known for its elaborate live performances. Originally known as JJ Boyz and Inner City Posse, the group introduced supernatural- and horror-themed lyrics as a means of distinguishing itself stylistically. The duo founded the independent record label Psychopathic Records with Alex Abbiss as manager, and produced and starred in the feature films Big Money Hustlas and Big Money Rustlas. They formed their own professional wrestling promotion, Juggalo Championship Wrestling, and later collaborated with many hip hop and rock musicians.\r\n\r\nThe songs of Insane Clown Posse center thematically on the mythology of the Dark Carnival, a metaphoric limbo in which the lives of the dead are judged by one of several entities. The Dark Carnival is elaborated through a series of stories called Joker\'s Cards, each of which offers a specific lesson designed to change the \"evil ways\" of listeners before \"the end consumes us all\". The original lineup of Insane Clown Posse was John Utsler (John Kickjazz), Joe Bruce (Violent J) and Joey Utsler (Shaggy 2 Dope). John Utsler left before Carnival of Carnage was released in 1992.\r\n\r\nInsane Clown Posse\'s performance style is often described as horrorcore hip hop, which \"utilize shocking (and blatantly over-the-top) narratives to give an over-exaggerated, almost cartoon-like version of urban deprivation in Detroit\", according to author Sara Cohen. Bruce and Utsler describe many of their lyrics as being tongue-in-cheek. The group\'s early work features a raw, minimalistic sound, which later evolved into a more rock-oriented style. The group\'s lyrics serve as morality tales, with songs focusing on subjects such as cannibalism, murder and necrophilia. Insane Clown Posse\'s debut album, Carnival of Carnage, features a politically-oriented focus, criticizing elitism and prejudice against those who live in the ghetto, while the album\'s liner notes criticize the Gulf War. The group\'s lyrics have opposed racism, bigotry, domestic violence, and child abuse.\r\n\r\nInsane Clown Posse has covered songs by Geto Boys, Sly Fox, and Above the Law. Bruce and Utsler refer to Ice Cube, Awesome Dre, Geto Boys, and Esham as influences on their own music, while Bruce has expressed admiration for Gong, Pearl Jam, and Michael Jackson. Mike E. Clark\'s production for the group incorporates elements such as \"carnival organ riffs, power chords and shotgun blasts...banjolike plucking and Van Halen-esque guitar squeals\", while Bruce and Utsler sometimes alternate between rapping and screaming. Bruce has credited pop music as an influence on some of the group\'s material, even terming the music \"Wicked Pop\". Bruce has also stated \"We do our own genre of music\". In his review of The Tempest, Allmusic\'s David Jeffries writes that Bruce and Utsler \"[rap] in a carnival barker fashion that fits with their circus motif, their Insane Clown disguises, and Mike E. Clark\'s big top-inspired production.\" Insane Clown Posse has influenced similar acts, such as Axe Murder Boyz, Blaze Ya Dead Homie and Boondox. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Insane+Clown+Posse\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The two guitarists, who grew up outside Los Angeles, met in high school and began writing songs together, drawing inspiration from songwriters such as Kim Deal, Liz Phair, and Elliott Smith. Despite now living far apart while they finish college, the two continue to write together in the same way they always have, assembling DIY west coast tours and workshoping new songs during breaks.\r\n\r\nMomma\'s debut album, Interloper, and recent Apollo 7\" showcase the duo\'s dynamic song structure and gripping lyrics. For their second full-length album, Two of Me, Friedman and Weingarten crafted an ambitious concept album called \"The Bug House,\" a fictional world where tragic heroes experience poetic justice in carnivalesque settings. The album deals with themes of morality, youth, and punishment, exploring the darker side of the self.\r\n\r\nThe album was recorded in Los Angeles with producer/engineer Aron Kobayashi Ritch, who helped the duo experiment with deeper and more distorted sounds. Drummer Zach Capitti Fenton and bass player Sebastian Jones made up the rhythm section for most of the album\'s tracks. The album\'s opener, \"Bug House,\" sets the stage for the record with its expressive guitar tones and brooding mood. The album\'s more abrasive moments, like \"Derby,\" are balanced by melodic ballads like \"Double Dare.\"\r\n\r\nFriedman and Weingarten each take a solo spotlight on their respective performances of \"Ready Runner\" and \"Not a Runner,\" which feature tender instrumentation and introspective lyrics.

Their personal tastes and intuitions are valued and explored by one another equally, allowing them to create a record that feels both familiar and intriguing.

Most recently, the group won a spot on the Ernie Ball sponsored Mayercruise 2009 (opening for acts such as John Mayer, O.A.R. and Guster) and “Best Pop/Rock Band” honors in the 2009 “Absolute Best of Tulsa” Music Awards.\r\nNow, roughly two years after forming, the band has emerged from the studio with its full length debut CD, Love Gone Mad, a wholly realized reflection of love, life and rollercoaster of emotions that accompany them. With it, Stars Go Dim is proving to be more than just a singles driven band.\r\nYes, there are more than a few radio ready cuts within, but when listened to as whole, Love Gone Mad explores the full range of emotions when love does just that. From the stages of infatuation in “Incredible” and “Crazy” to the struggles of maintaining a relationship in “Where Has Our Love Gone” to realizing it’s over, breaking things off, moving on and starting over in “Letting Go,” “Walk On” and “Get Over it,” the band has painted a moving portrait of love and life in progress.\r\nSerendipitously, the band never set out to create an album with such a broad and over arching theme – it all came naturally.\r\n“After the first three song demo came together,” Avalos says, “I basically wrote the rest of the album in two weeks. The theme just came together organically - it’s not like I was thinking about it. I probably wrote 20 songs in roughly two weeks and this is what came out of it.”\r\n“It’s not like we set out to create a concept record,” he explains. “We were just writing a bunch of songs. When we came together, we didn’t even know what kind of band we were.”\r\nUltimately, SGD has proven to be a band that connects incredibly on an individual level, whether through song or by interacting with its audience. Building upon the experimental spirit that led the band to document its evolution before its fans, Stars Go Dim continues to think progressively, gradually revealing the full story of Love Gone Mad in a multi-media experience that includes the DVD, Life.Love.Music.Soul.\r\nBeyond that, the band’s vision is explored even further in the digital novel Love Remembered, which was inspired by the album. It’s a tale of two couples separated by time, whose lives intertwine as they experience love, loss and restoration – and learn that love is the one thing worth fighting for, even when it has gone mad.\r\nIf you haven’t yet experienced Stars Go Dim, now is the time. With a new emotionally charged album, incorporated media presentation and compelling live show, it will only take a few listens to understand why local media such as Urban Tulsa Weekly says: “It’s not a matter of if, but rather when this band will break.” <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Stars+Go+Dim\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Known for their technically complex guitar work and musicianship, Megadeth is one of the \"big four\" of American thrash metal along with Metallica, Anthrax, and Slayer, responsible for the genre\'s development and popularization. Their music features complex arrangements and fast rhythm sections, dual lead guitars, and lyrical themes of war, politics, religion, death, and personal relationships.\r\n\r\nDave Mustaine was an early member of the band Metallica, and helped pen tracks that wound up on their first two albums. In 1983, Mustaine was let go from the group by Lars Ulrich and James Hetfield due to personal conflicts and substance abuse. He would be replaced by Kirk Hammett, guitarist for the Bay Area thrash band Exodus, who remains with the band to this day. Dave felt slighted and vowed to make his own band, which would be even faster and heavier than Metallica. Mustaine picked the name \"Megadeth\" from a pamphlet by California senator Alan Cranston that read: \"The arsenal of megadeath can\'t be rid no matter what the peace treaties come to.\" \r\n\r\nIn 1985, Megadeth released their debut album, Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!, on the independent record label Combat Records, to moderate success. It caught the attention of bigger labels, which led to Megadeth signing with Capitol Records. Their first major-label album, Peace Sells... but Who\'s Buying?, was released in 1986 and was a major hit with the underground metal scene. Band members\' substance abuse issues and personal disputes had brought Megadeth negative publicity during the late 1980s. Nonetheless, the band went on to release a number of platinum-selling albums, including So Far, So Good... So What! (1988), Rust in Peace (1990), and Countdown to Extinction (1992). These albums, along with worldwide tours, brought them public recognition.\r\n\r\nMegadeth has had numerous guitarists, drummers and bassists throughout its 39-year career, with Mustaine being the only remaining original member of the group. The band temporarily disbanded in 2002 when Mustaine suffered an arm injury and re-established in 2004 without longtime bassist David Ellefson, who had taken legal action against him. Ellefson settled out of court and rejoined the band in 2010, but was fired in 2021 amid allegations of sexual misconduct. Megadeth\'s current lineup includes Mustaine, bassist James LoMenzo, guitarist Kiko Loureiro and drummer Dirk Verbeuren.\r\n\r\nMegadeth earned platinum certifications in the United States for six of its sixteen studio albums, and has received twelve Grammy nominations. Megadeth won its first Grammy Award in 2017 for the song \"Dystopia\" in the Best Metal Performance category. The band\'s mascot, Vic Rattlehead, regularly appears on album artwork and live shows. Megadeth has hosted its own music festival, Gigantour, several times since July 2005, and held its first MegaCruise in October 2019.\r\n\r\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megadeth\r\n\r\nStudio albums\r\nKilling Is My Business... and Business Is Good!

Regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century, he is often referred to as the \"King of Rock and Roll\" or simply \"the King\".\r\n\r\nPresley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, and relocated to Memphis, Tennessee, with his family when he was 13 years old. His music career began there in 1954, recording at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips, who wanted to bring the sound of African American music to a wider audience. Accompanied by guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, Presley was a pioneer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. In 1955, drummer D. J. Fontana joined to complete the lineup of Presley\'s classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who would manage the singer for more than two decades. Presley\'s first RCA single, \"Heartbreak Hotel\", was released in January 1956 and became a number one hit in the United States. With a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records, he became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations, made him enormously popular—and controversial.\r\n\r\nIn November 1956, Presley made his film debut in Love Me Tender. Drafted into military service in 1958, Presley relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. He held few concerts however, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood movies and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed television comeback special Elvis, which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973, Presley gave the first concert by a solo artist to be broadcast around the world, Aloha from Hawaii. Years of prescription drug abuse severely compromised his health, and he died suddenly in 1977 at his Graceland estate, just 42 years of age.\r\n\r\nPresley is one of the most celebrated and influential musicians of the 20th century. Commercially successful in many genres, including pop, country, blues, and gospel, he is the best-selling solo artist in the history of recorded music. He won three competitive Grammys, received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at age 36, and has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Elvis+Presley\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Formed in 2010, the band is led by husband-and-wife musicians Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi, and primarily features members from their solo groups. Their debut album, Revelator, won a Grammy Award for Best Blues Album.\r\n\r\nThe band was founded after both Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi put their solo bands on hiatus to form a new group that lets the married couple focus on making music together, and allows them to spend more time together while touring and recording. Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi have toured together in 2007, under the name Derek Trucks & Susan Tedeschi\'s Soul Stew Revival, however this group\'s material was largely culled from Derek & Susan\'s solo projects, while the Derek Trucks & Susan Tedeschi Band mostly focuses on performing original songs.\r\n\r\nAfter the announcement in late 2009 of a hiatus for both The Derek Trucks Band and Susan Tedeschi Band , the couple began writing new material, working out of their home studio in Jacksonville with a rotating cast of friends and musicians. Their first concert was on April 1, 2010 at the Savannah Music Festival, and although their touring schedule was limited in 2010, the group did perform at Eric Clapton\'s Crossroads Guitar Festival, Fuji Rock Festival, and several other festivals and venues.\r\n\r\nThe collaboration between Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi has also extended to other artists. Trucks and Tedeschi appeared together on Herbie Hancock\'s album, The Imagine Project, performing the track \"Space Captain\" with additional members of Derek Trucks & Susan Tedeschi Band, including Oteil Burbridge, Kofi Burbridge, and Mike Mattison. A music video was also released, showing Herbie Hancock as he recorded the song at Trucks & Tedeschi\'s home studio.

The band consists of Charles (Black Francis) Thompson IV (vocals, guitar; also known as \'\'Frank Black\'\'), Joey Santiago (lead guitar),   David Lovering (drums) and Emma Richardson (bass, vocals). Until 2013, the band also featured  Kim Deal on bass and vocals. From 2016 until 2024 the band also featured Paz Lechantin on bass and vocals.   The band officially split in 1993  and reunited in 2004. They went on hiatus in 2007, with each band member pursuing projects of their own, only to reunite in 2009, with the announcement of a new tour commencing in Europe that summer.\r\n\r\nAlthough quite popular on alternative rock radio in the United States due to heavy airplay of the singles \"Monkey Gone to Heaven\" and \"Here Comes Your Man\", they were never widely popular there, but found success in Europe, especially in the UK (where they managed three top 40 singles \"Velouria\", \"Planet of Sound\" and a re-release of \"Debaser\") and Belgium and the Netherlands, where they were heavily broadcasted by alternative public radio. \r\n\r\nThe band\'s style of alternative rock music is heavily influenced by punk and surf rock, and while highly melodic, is capable of being tremendously abrasive at the same time. Francis is the Pixies\' primary songwriter and singer and has a distinctly desperate, yowling delivery. He has typically written cryptic songs about offbeat subjects, such as UFOs and surrealism. References to mental instability, violent Biblical imagery, and physical injury feature in many of the band\'s songs.\r\n\r\nThe group is frequently posited as the immediate forebear of the alternative rock boom of the 1990s, though they disbanded before reaping any of the benefits this might have brought them. Avowed fan Kurt Cobain\'s acknowledgement of the debt Nirvana owed to the Pixies, along with similar tributes by other alternative bands, ensured that the Pixies\' legacy and influence grew substantially in the years following their demise.\r\n\r\nIn 1993, during an interview with BBC Radio 5, Black Francis announced that the band had split - something he had not told his bandmates. After the interview, he called Santiago, who in turn faxed Deal and Lovering the news the next morning. After the split, Black Francis inverted his stage name to Frank Black and embarked on a successful solo career, while Deal resumed her role in The Breeders with her identical twin sister Kelley. In 2004, the band reunited for a tour - documented in the film loudQUIETloud - and released a new single, \"Bam Thwok\" that summer. In 2007, Black Francis (now going by that name again) stated in an interview that the reunion was \"done\" even though the members remain in good terms with each other. In later interviews however, he began to mention that he might be willing to record another Pixies album. Nonetheless, Francis has returned to his solo career and Deal to the Breeders, both of which released albums and toured in 2008. Lovering and Santiago, meanwhile, set up their own project, a band called Everybody.\r\n\r\nIn order to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the release of Doolittle, Pixies launched a tour in October 2009, on which they perform all the album\'s songs and B-sides.

In fact, so many members of Brent’s extended family have musical ability that he can’t really name them all. Music was not only in his blood, it was played and heard in his home as a child and in the homes of most of his relatives throughout his youth. As this 24-year-old native of Americus, Georgia, would say, “It goes way deep.” Deep as it was, there was no way that he could know growing up that these same familial ties would lead him on a crazy journey that would take him from small town Georgia to the mean streets of LA and back home again, eventually landing him in Nashville, writing songs and collaborating with some of the biggest names in country music today.\r\n\r\nFor Brent Cobb, making music was not so much a decision but rather a calling. And his vision was as broad as his influences, ranging from rock greats like Tom Petty, Bob Seger and The Rolling Stones to folk icons Townes Van Zant and Bob Dylan to legendary stylists Otis Redding, Waylon Jennings, Johnny Cash and Hank Williams. Throughout his teens, he was overwhelmed with passion for the music that would later shape him. When he took up the guitar at age 13, it wasn’t long before he was playing and singing for family and friends, eventually joining local cover bands and writing songs of his own. \r\n\r\nShortly after his 18th birthday, Brent was a pallbearer in his great-aunt’s funeral, along with his cousin, record producer Dave Cobb, who returned to Georgia from LA for the funeral services. Dave had recently completed country music legend Waylon Jennings’s son, Shooter Jennings’ first album. Unbeknownst to Brent, his parents slipped Dave a CD of some songs Brent had written and recorded. Within two days of returning to Los Angeles, Dave had listened to the songs, played them for Shooter and was on the phone to Brent, inviting him to LA to record what would become his 2006 debut album, No Place Left To Leave (produced by Dave Cobb and Shooter Jennings). \r\n\r\nThe album release contributed to Brent’s decision to relocate to Los Angeles in 2007. Having never lived outside of the state of Georgia, adjusting to big city life was a shock to his system. Landing a job in the art department for a film production company, he spent his days building sets and his nights trying to move his music career forward, all the while questioning whether L.A. was truly the right place for him. Six months into his stint, Brent got lost returning from the airport. Stopping to re-orient himself with his window down, he looked up to find a gun in his face. He was being robbed at gunpoint. It was time to move back to Georgia. \r\n\r\nPrior to his time in Los Angeles, Brent had fronted regional band, Mile Marker 5, in Georgia, occasionally opening shows for Capitol Records recording artist and fellow Georgian Luke Bryan. Bryan took an interest in Brent and generously made a handful of Nashville based introductions, which led him to Carnival Music where he’s been writing ever since. \r\n\r\nHis affiliation with Carnival Music precipitated a move to (a much more manageable city) Nashville, and he has since penned songs for several major label projects, including Kellie Pickler, The Eli Young Band, and Luke Bryan. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Brent+Cobb\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Their mix of rocking guitars and electric cello created a unique dynamic, blending their love of rock artists like The Black Keys and folk bands like The Violent Femmes.  Working on  covers grew tiresome, and an emotional break-up soon inspired them to write their first song together.

They later recruited mutual friends Binns and Thomas to play bass and drums, forming the band.

The truth is, I never intended to do this for a living. I grew up...in a Quaker family, and for me being Quaker was a political calling rather than a religious one.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1967 Raitt continued her pursuit in that path when she entered Harvard\'s Radcliffe College as a freshman, majoring in African Studies. \"My plan was to travel to Tanzania, where President Julius Nyerere was creating a government based on democracy and socialism,\" Raitt recalled. \"I wanted to help undo the damage that Western colonialism had done to native cultures around the world. Cambridge was a hotbed of this kind of thinking, and I was thrilled.\"\r\n\r\nOne day, Raitt was notified by a friend that blues promoter Dick Waterman was giving an interview at WHRB, Harvard\'s college radio station. An important figure in the blues revival of the 1960s, Waterman was also a resident of Cambridge. Raitt went to see Waterman, and the two soon became friends, \"much to the chagrin of my parents, who didn\'t expect their freshman daughter to be running around with 65-year-old bluesmen,\" recalled Raitt. \"I was amazed by his passion for the music and the integrity with which he managed the musicians.\"\r\n\r\nDuring Raitt\'s sophomore year, Waterman relocated to Philadelphia, and a number of local musicians he counted among his friends went with him. Raitt had become a strong part of that community, recalling that \"these people had become my friends, my mentors, and though I had every intention of graduating, I decided to take the semester off and move to Philadelphia...It was an opportunity that young white girls just don\'t get, and as it turns out, an opportunity that changed everything.\"\r\n\r\nRaitt eventually went back to school, but her time performing in Philadelphia had encouraged her to pursue music as a career. When Waterman contacted her and invited her to tour with The Rolling Stones, she made a second trip to the admissions office at Radcliffe and told them, \"I\'m going to take a leave of absence, but this is only going to last a year.\" As Raitt would later recall, \"Imagine being 20 in 1970—wouldn\'t you have gone on tour with the Rolling Stones?\"\r\n\r\nBy now, Raitt was also playing both folk as well as rhythm and blues clubs in the Boston area, performing alongside established blues legends like Howlin\' Wolf, Sippie Wallace, and Mississippi Fred McDowell, all of whom she met through Waterman. In the fall of 1970, while opening for Fred McDowell at the Gaslight Cafe in New York, a reporter from Newsweek Magazine saw her and began to spread word of her performance. Scouts from major record companies were soon attending her shows to watch her play. She eventually accepted an offer with Warner Bros. who soon released her eponymously titled debut in 1971. The album was warmly received by the music press, many of which praised her skills as an interpreter and as a bottleneck guitarist; at the time, very few women in popular music had strong reputations as guitarists.\r\n\r\nWhile admired by those who saw her perform, and respected by her peers, Raitt gained little public acclaim for her work. Her critical stature continued to grow but record sales remained modest. Her second album, Give It Up, was released in 1972 to universal acclaim, and though many critics still regard it as her best work, it did not change her commercial fortunes. 1973\'s Takin\' My Time was also met with critical acclaim, but these notices were not matched by the sales.\r\n\r\nRaitt was beginning to receive greater press coverage, including a 1975 cover story for Rolling Stone Magazine, but with 1974\'s Streetlights, reviews for her work were becoming increasingly mixed. By now, Raitt was already experimenting with different producers and different styles, and she began to adopt a more mainstream sound that continued through 1975\'s Home Plate.\r\n\r\nIn 1976, Raitt made a notable appearance on Warren Zevon\'s self-titled album with Warren Zevon\'s friend Jackson Browne and Fleetwood Mac\'s Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks.\r\n\r\n1977\'s Sweet Forgiveness gave Raitt her first commercial breakthrough when it yielded a hit single in her cover of Del Shannon\'s \"Runaway.\" Recast as a heavy r&b recording based on a rhythmic groove inspired by Al Green, Raitt\'s version of \"Runaway\" was disparaged by many critics, but its commercial success prompted a bidding war between Warner Bros. and Columbia Records. \"There was this big Columbia – Warner war going on at the time,\" recalled Raitt in a 1990 interview. \"James Taylor had just left Warner Bros. and made a big album for Columbia...And then, Warners signed Paul Simon away from Columbia, and they didn\'t want me to have a hit record for Columbia — no matter what! So, I renegotiated my contract, and they basically matched Columbia\'s offer. Frankly the deal was a really big deal.\"\r\n\r\nWarner Bros. held higher expectations for Raitt\'s next album, 1979\'s The Glow, but it was released to poor reviews as well as modest sales. Raitt would have one commercial success in 1979 when she helped organize the five MUSE (Musicians United for Safe Energy) concerts at Madison Square Garden. The shows spawned a three-record gold album as well as a Warner Bros. feature film, No Nukes. The shows featured co-founders Jackson Browne, Graham Nash, John Hall, and Raitt as well as Bruce Springsteen, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, The Doobie Brothers, James Taylor, Gil Scott-Heron, and numerous others.\r\n\r\nFor her next record, 1982\'s Green Light, Raitt made a conscious attempt to revisit the sound of her earlier records, but to her surprise, many of her peers and members of the press would compare her new sound to the burgeoning New Wave movement. The album received her strongest reviews in years, but her sales did not improve and this would have a severe impact on her relationship with Warner Bros.\r\n\r\nIn 1983, as Raitt was finishing work on her follow-up album, titled Tongue & Groove, Warner Bros. cleaned house, dropping a number of major artists from their roster. Van Morrison and Arlo Guthrie were two of the most high-profile cases, and the day after mastering was completed on Tongue & Groove, Raitt was notified that she was to be dropped too. The album was shelved indefinitely, and Raitt was left without a label. By now, Raitt was also struggling with alcohol and drug abuse.\r\n\r\nDespite her personal and professional problems, Raitt continued to tour and participate in political activism. In 1985, she sang and appeared in the video of \"Sun City,\" the anti-apartheid record written a produced by Steven Van Zandt. Along with her participation in Farm Aid and Amnesty International concerts, Raitt would later travel to Moscow in 1987 as part of the first joint Soviet/American Peace Concert later shown on Showtime television. Also in 1987, Raitt would organize a benefit in Los Angeles, for Countdown \'87 to Stop Contra Aid, featuring herself, Don Henley, Herbie Hancock, Holly Near and others.\r\n\r\nTwo years after dropping her from their label, Warner Bros. notified Raitt of their plans to release Tongue & Groove. \"I said it wasn\'t really fair,\" recalled Raitt. \"I think at this point they felt kind of bad. I mean, I was out there touring on my savings to keep my name up, and my ablility to draw was less and less. So they agreed to let me go in and recut half of it, and that\'s when it came out as Nine Lives.\" A critical and commercial disappointment, 1986\'s Nine Lives would be Raitt\'s last new recording for Warner Bros.\r\n\r\nIn late 1987 she joined k.d. lang and Jennifer Warnes as female background vocals for Roy Orbison\'s television special, Roy Orbison and Friends, A Black and White Night. By now, Raitt was clean and sober, having broken her substance abuse — for which she would credit Stevie Ray Vaughan in a Minnesota State Fair concert[1] the night after Vaughan\'s 1990 death. Following this highly acclaimed broadcast, she began working on new material. During this time, Raitt considered signing with Prince\'s own label, Paisley Park, but negotiations would ultimately fall through. Instead she began recording a bluesy mix of pop and rock under the production guidance of Don Was at Capitol Records.\r\n\r\nRaitt had met Was through Hal Wilner, who was putting together Stay Awake, a tribute album to Disney music for A&M. Was and Wilner both wanted Raitt to sing lead on an adult-contemporary arrangement created by Was for \"Baby Mine,\" the lullaby from Dumbo. Raitt was very pleased with the sessions, and she asked Don to produce her next album.\r\n\r\nAfter more than twenty years of singing and recording popular music, Bonnie Raitt achieved immense success with her 10th album. Released in 1989, Nick of Time went to the top of the U.S. charts and won three Grammy Awards. At the same time, she walked away with a fourth Grammy Award for her duet \"In the Mood\" with John Lee Hooker on his album \"The Healer\".\r\n\r\nShe followed up this success with three more Grammy Awards for her 1991 album, Luck of the Draw, then, in 1994 she added two more Grammy\'s with her album Longing in Their Hearts. Both of these albums were multiplatinum successes. Raitt\'s collaboration with Was would amicably come to an end with 1995\'s live release, Road Tested. Released to solid reviews, it sold well enough to be certified gold.\r\n\r\nFor her next studio album, Raitt hired Mitchell Froom and Tchad Blake as her producers. \"I loved working with Don Was but I wanted to give myself and my fans a stretch and do something different,\" Raitt said. Her work with Froom and Blake was released on Fundamental in 1998.\r\n\r\nIn March of 2000, Raitt was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\r\n\r\nSilver Lining was released in 2002 while Souls Alike was released in September of 2005. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bonnie+Raitt\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The name is derived from the name of lead vocalist Jónsi Birgisson\'s little sister, Sigurrós. They hail from the same creative and vibrant Icelandic music scene as múm and Amiina. They released their first-ever foray into film-making with their tour documentary, Heima in late 2007. \r\n\r\nJón Þór Birgisson (Jónsi), Georg Hólm, and Ágúst Ævar Gunnarsson formed the group in Reykjavík, Iceland in August 1994. They soon won a record deal with a local record label, Smekkleysa (Bad Taste). In 1997, they released Von (Hope) and in 1998, released a remix collection named Von brigði. The name is Icelandic wordplay: Vonbrigði means \"disappointment,\" but Von brigði means \"hope alteration.\" (In English, the album is sometimes known by the alternative name \"Recycle Bin.\")\r\n\r\nInternational acclaim came with 1999\'s Ágætis Byrjun (\"An alright start\"), for which the band were joined by Kjartan Sveinsson. The album\'s reputation slowly spread by word of mouth over the next two years. Soon, many critics worldwide hailed it as one of the best albums of its time, and the band was playing with Radiohead and other big names. Drummer Ágúst left the band after the recording of Ágætis Byrjun and was replaced by Orri Páll Dýrason.\r\n\r\nAfter the release of Ágætis Byrjun, the band became perhaps most well known for Birgisson\'s signature style of playing guitar with the bow from a cello, accentuated with reverb, creating a sweeping, fluid sound that is unique for an electric guitar. \r\n\r\nIn early 2001, Sigur Rós set out to record some songs in their newly-completed álafoss swimming pool studio with their friend Steindór Andersen who is a fisherman and chairman of the Icelandic poetry society, Iðunn. Steindór is a chanter/singer of the traditional Icelandic epic poetry form, called \"rímur,\" for which the band named their next EP, Rímur. Only 1000 copies of the EP were printed and sold in the spring tour of 2001. \r\n\r\nIn 2002, their highly anticipated follow-up album ( ) was released. Upon release, all tracks on the album were untitled, though the band later published song names on their website. Famously, all of the lyrics on ( ) are sung in vonlenska (\"Hopelandic\"), nonsensical vocalizations that resemble the sound of the Icelandic language. It has also been said that the listener is supposed to interpret their own meanings of the lyrics, which can then be written in the blank pages in the album booklet.\r\n\r\nIn October of 2003, Sigur Rós joined Radiohead in composing music for Merce Cunningham\'s dance piece Split Sides; Sigur Rós’s three tracks were named \"Ba Ba,\" \"Ti Ki,\" and \"Di Do\" and released in March of 2004 on an EP titled Ba Ba Ti Ki Di Do The three songs are separate tracks, but the band intended that all three be played at the same time to form one single song. The band\'s 1997 debut album Von also finally found a United States and United Kingdom release in October of 2004. Their latest full-length album, Takk... (Thanks...), was released on September 13, 2005, with a free legal download of their first single, \"Glósóli,\" made available on August 15. For North American fans, \"Sæglópur\" was made available for download on August 16.\"Hoppípolla,\" the second official single from Takk..., was released on November 28 alongside a new studio remake of \"Hafsól,\" a song which was previously released on the band\'s 1997 debut, Von. \r\n\r\nSæglópur EP was released on July 10 in most parts of the world and on August 8 in the United States. Its original release date was May 8, but because of the sudden demand of \"Hoppípolla,\" especially in the UK due to its inclusion on BBC\'s \"Planet Earth,\" it was pushed back from that date. Sigur Rós recorded three new songs for the EP: \"Refur,\" \"Ófriður,\" and \"Kafari.\"\r\n\r\nThe Hvarf/Heim double album was released on November 5, 2007. Hvarf contains reworkings of songs dating back to the bands\' first album, whereas Heim contains live acoustic versions of more well-known songs. The double album was an accompaniment to the film Heima. Heima is a documentary showing footage of the band\'s tour of Iceland, including live footage and interviews. The official web site is www.heimafilm.com.\r\n\r\nSigur Rós has sold over 2.5 million albums worldwide.\r\n\r\nOn June 23, 2008, they released Með suð í eyrum við spilum endalaust. \r\nThe single \"Gobbledigook\" was available for a free download on their website.\r\n\r\nIn January 2010, the band began a hiatus, and they are now working on new material.

The group is notable for the hit songs \"Come Go with Me\" and \"Whispering Bells\", and for having been a successful racially mixed musical group during a period of time when such groups were rare.\r\n\r\nThe Del-Vikings were formed in 1955 by members of the United States Air Force stationed in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with Clarence Quick (February 2, 1937 – May 5, 1983), Kripp Johnson (May 16, 1933 – June 22, 1990), Don Jackson, Samuel Paterson, Bernard Robertson and Clarence Harvey Ringo. Because all of the members were in the armed forces, the group constantly ran the risk of being disrupted by members being stationed in other places. This happened soon after the group\'s forming when Paterson and Robertson were sent to Germany. They were replaced by baritone David Lerchey, the group\'s first white member, and tenor Norman Wright. Norman Wright had started a group with Lawrence \"Prince\" Lloyd called The Valverteens from Amarillo Air Force Base,Texas before joining The Del-Vikings.\r\n\r\nThe band\'s name was created by Clarence Quick while talking to Clarence Ringo at the library on base. Some sources say that the band members had read about Vikings with the prefix \"Del\" being \"added to give the group name an air of mystery.\" Another suggestion is that Clarence Quick had known of a basketball team in Brooklyn, New York, called the Vikings and had suggested the name. The name may also have originated from the popular Viking Press, publisher of paperbacks that group members liked to read. Clarence Harvey Ringo is vehement about the name being created by him and Clarence Quick at the Greater Pittsburgh airbase library, although he is largely uncredited for his contribution.\r\n\r\nTheir first hit came in December 1956 with \"Come Go with Me\", released on Fee Bee Records as catalog number FB-205. In January 1957 Dot Records re-released \"Come Go With Me\" as Dot 45-15538, taking it nationally. The group quickly found itself in greater demand following Dot\'s re-release which propelled the group into the Top 10 on Billboard\'s pop chart. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. Soon after, Jackson left and was replaced by Gus Backus, the group\'s second white member.\r\n\r\nAll of the group members, other than Kripp Johnson, were under 21 when they signed their recording contract with Fee Bee (a tiny Pittsburgh label, which was later distributed by Dot Records). Having signed the contract as minors, they had the right to be released from it. In 1957, under the direction of their manager, Alan Strauss, they left to record at Mercury Records. Johnson, who was still bound to Fee Bee/Dot, stayed, thus creating two Del Viking groups. The original group replaced Johnson with Quick\'s friend William Blakely and recorded the Backus-led song \"Cool Shake\". Kripp Johnson constructed a new group with the returning Don Jackson, Chuck Jackson, Arthur Budd, and Ed Everette. This group recorded the Kripp Johnson-led \"I\'m Spinning\", billing themselves as the Dell Vikings. Dot also released \"Whispering Bells\", with Kripp Johnson again featured on lead. The Dot label added an \'s\' to his name which read \"featuring \'Krips\' Johnson\". It reached number nine on Billboard\'s Top 100 chart. Around this time, some old Fee Bee demo tracks had been sold to an up-and-coming record company, Luniverse, who overdubbed a backing track on these accapella songs, which included an early version of \"Come Go with Me\". The overdubbed demo was included as a track on an eight-song album subsequently released by Luniverse. Only one single was released from these Luniverse overdubs—\"Somewhere Over The Rainbow\"/ \"Hey Senorita\".\r\n\r\nJohnson\'s Dot group had an extra advantage—he had been discharged from the USAF and his group could tour freely, while the original group needed to seek military leave in order to tour. Mercury sued, claiming it had sole rights to any spelling of the group\'s name, and the Dell-Vikings briefly became The Versatiles, with singles being billed to \"Kripp Johnson and the Versatiles\" or \"Chuck Jackson and the Versatiles\". The group broke up, with Chuck Jackson going on to a successful solo career. \r\nMeanwhile, the original group had begun to fall apart. Gus Backus was re-stationed, leaving the group a quartet. They broke up soon after. Quick restructured the group with new talent from the Pittsburgh area—lead tenor, Billie Woodruff, Willie Green, Douglass White, and Ritzy Lee. By the end of 1957, with the breakup of the \"Dell\" Vikings, Kripp Johnson returned to the original group, making them a sextet. They signed to ABC-Paramount. While the nucleus of the group was back, they weren\'t able to chart any more hits, and the group split up in 1965.\r\n\r\nThe Del Vikings were back in 1970 with a near original line-up- Clarence Quick, Kripp Johnson, Norman Wright, Dave Lerchey, and William Blakely. The group re-recorded many of their old hits for Scepter Records; a new version of \"Come Go With Me\" made the Bubbling Under The Hot 100 chart in 1973 (it also wound up on the Easy Listening chart, where it peaked that year at #32). Things began to unravel quickly, however, as members began to leave once again. David Finley was in one of the lead spots from 1972-76. Another group, with lead singer Billy Woodruff, Ritzy Lee, Terry Young, Mona Lisa Young and Paul Moser lasted a short time in the mid-seventies. Later in the seventies, the group was Quick, Blakely, Louis C. Velez (whom Quick, now the only original member, selected to replace him when he was no longer able to perform), Arthur Martinez, and Jerry Williams.\r\n\r\nIn 1980, Kripp Johnson restarted the \"Dell\" Vikings with Dave Lerchey, 1960s member Ritzy Lee, and new member John Byas. Norman Wright rejoined this group in 1990. In the Del Vikings, Jerry Williams was replaced by Herbert McQueen.\r\n\r\nFrank \"Mingo\" Ayers replaced William Blakely in the early 80s. He suffered some health problems after a short time and Dickie Harmon was brought in as a sub. The group lost its last original member, Clarence Quick, when he died on May 5, 1983. His place was taken by Lloyd \"Butch\" Phillips. Leroy Binns of the Charts supplied bass vocals for a time—later being taken over by Bernard \"BJ\" Jones (current member of the Dubs.) After Frank Ayers return, Dickie Harmon became a permanent member and Louis Velez took over bass vocals. They continued recording, and released an album in 1991 for BVM Records entitled Rock and Roll Remembered.\r\n\r\nKripp Johnson died in 1990. His group (John Byas, Dave Lerchey, Norman Wright, and Ritzy Lee) continued to perform at major resorts in the US, Canada, and Caribbean, as well as major cruise lines and various casinos. After the death of John Byas in 1999, Norman Wright left and reformed another group with his sons Anthony Wright and Norman Wright, Jr., and friend Mike Machado. Dave Lerchey retired but occasionally performed with this incarnation of the group and it was this group, with Lerchey, that was featured on the PBS special Doo Wop 50 in 1999.\r\n\r\nLerchey formed another Del Vikings group in the mid-90s shortly before his death on January 29, 2005.[9] The group consisted of Lerchey, Danny Ardell, Tommy West, and Joe Rios.\r\n\r\nFrank Ayers would later be out of the Clarence Quick group at which time the group would reorganize with bassman Les Levine entering and Harmon taking over lead vocals. Ayers died in 1999. 2002 marked Dickie Harmon leaving the group and becoming a member of The Teenagers and the death of Lloyd \"Butch\" Phillips. Phillips, Harmon, and Binns had backed up Joe Grier as The Charts that year. By the mid 2000s, the line-up was Velez, Martinez, Les Levine, Ron Coleman, and Reggie Walker. Unfortunately, after a long battle with ill health, \"Sweet\" Lou Velez died on May 31, 2008. Shelly Wengrovsky joined the group in the middle of 2008. During the latter part of 2009, Ron Coleman joined \"The Channels\". Reggie Walker died on January 25, 2010. The addition of Lewis McMillan and Bobby Walker in April 2010 now completes the quintet.\r\n\r\nNorman Wright died on April 23, 2010.\r\n\r\nThe group\'s biggest hits have been used in such films as American Graffiti, American Hot Wax, The Hollywood Knights, Diner, Stand By Me, and Joe Versus the Volcano.\r\n\r\nRitzy Lee, who was a member of The Del-Vikings from 1959 until his retirement in 2003, is now part owner of a recording company titled Rock Bottom Blues Company based in Beverly Hills, CA. Along with Robert \"Junior\" Brantley, and Sam McWhorter, co-founders of the company, Lee is recording, and producing entertainers in the blues, rock, and pop fields in the US and Asia.\r\n\r\nGus Backus (September 12, 1937 – February 21, 2019) was stationed as an Airman in the U.S. Air Force at Wiesbaden Air Base in 1957, Backus had to leave The Del-Vikings but he later became a popular singer of Schlager music in 1960s West Germany. He sang all his songs in German with an American accent. 19 of his songs between 1960 and 1967 made the charts, including eight Top Ten hits. He landed a Number 1 hit in the German charts with his song Der Mann im Mond (The Man in the Moon) in 1961. Backus also did German cover versions of songs by Elvis Presley, Paul Anka and Conway Twitty.\r\n\r\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Del-Vikings\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Lemmy was also the primary songwriter and only constant member. The band are often considered a precursor to the new wave of British heavy metal, which re-energised heavy metal in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Though several guitarists and drummers have played in Motörhead, most of their best-selling albums and singles feature drummer Phil \"Philthy Animal\" Taylor and guitarist \"Fast\" Eddie Clarke. From 1995 until the band\'s breakup in 2015, the group consisted of Lemmy, Mikkey Dee (drums) and Phil Campbell (guitar).\r\n\r\nMotörhead released 23 studio albums, 10 live recordings, 12 compilation albums and five EPs over a career spanning 40 years. Usually a power trio, they had particular success in the early 1980s with several successful singles in the UK Top 40 chart. The albums Overkill, Bomber, Ace of Spades and, particularly, the live album No Sleep \'til Hammersmith cemented Motörhead\'s reputation as a top-tier rock band. The band are ranked number 26 on VH1\'s 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock. As of 2016, the band has sold more than 15 million albums worldwide.\r\n\r\nMost often classified as heavy metal, Motörhead has been credited with being part of and influencing numerous musical scenes, thrash metal and speed metal especially. Lemmy, however, always insisted that they were a rock and roll band. He said they had more in common with punk bands, but with their own unique sound, Motörhead is embraced in both punk and metal scenes. Their lyrics typically covered such topics as war, good versus evil, abuse of power, promiscuous sex, substance abuse and, most famously, gambling, the last theme being the focus of their hit song \"Ace of Spades\".\r\n\r\nLemmy died on 28 December 2015 from cardiac arrhythmia and congestive heart failure, after being diagnosed with prostate cancer. The day after his death, longtime members Dee and Campbell both confirmed that Motörhead had disbanded.

Starting with the rock’n’roll of the Beat Generation, they continued enriching their sound with blues influences, jazz, psychedelic, krautrock, culminating with the orientation towards Romanian folk music, which they blended harmoniously with the sound that was popular in the ’70s\r\n\r\nPhoenix is one of the most prominent Romanian Rock and Roll bands of the latest decades, and also the first one to take musical inspiration from ancient Romanian folk themes.\r\n\r\nFormed in the 1960s, it began by doing covers of Beatles songs. However, they soon had to change their style since the Romanian communist regime disliked any form of western culture. The communist regime suggested that all rock oriented bands should look for inspiration within the Romanian culture. These restrictions made the band’s leader Nicolae Covaci search within the Romanian folklore, which gave them a unique sound.\r\n\r\nThe beginning\r\n\r\nPhoenix was launched in the cosmopolitan city of Timişoara in 1962 by a pair of schoolboys: Nicu Covaci and Béla Kamocsa, under the name of Sfinţii (The Saints). In their first years, together with Florin “Moni” Bordeianu (born 1948), they performed in school contests and at local clubs, covering Western music hits from The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, The Who, etc., and they quickly became very popular amongst the youth. In 1965 the Communist authorities demanded that the band stop performing under the name The Saints, because of the religious innuendo that the name carried. Forced to comply, the band took the name Phoenix. Nicu Covaci also changed the composition of the band, around 1963, by adding Claudiu Rotaru, Ioan “Pilu” Ştefanovici (born 1946) and Günther “Spitzly” Reininger (born 1950) to the lineup.\r\n\r\nIn 1965 they had their first big concert in Bucharest. Their performance brought a collaboration with Cornel Chiriac to record some of their songs. The first songs they recorded were “Ştiu cǎ mǎ iubesti şi tu” (“I Know You Love Me Too”), “Dunăre, Dunăre” (“Danube, Danube”) and “Bun e vinul ghiurghiuliu” (“Good is the Red Wine”). The same year also marked the beginning of their collaboration with Victor Cârcu, who went on to write many of their most famous songs, such as “Vremuri” (“Old Times”), “Şi totuşi ca voi sunt” (“And Yet I Am Like You”), “Nebunul cu ochii închişi” (“Crazy Man with closed eyes”), “Floarea stîncilor” (“Mountain Flower”) and “Canarul” (“Canary”).\r\n\r\nIn December 1967 Phoenix had their first major series of concerts in many western cities, capped off by two huge concerts in Timişoara. After winning a few prizes in national students’ contests, held at Iaşi the following year, in 1968 they recorded their first EP, Vremuri (Old Times), containing two original songs, Vremuri and Canarul (The Canary), and two covers (Lady Madonna - The Beatles and Friday on my Mind - Easybeats). A second EP would follow one year later, named Floarea stîncilor (The Flower of the Rocks), with all four songs being original compositions. Both albums sport a sound reminiscent of the beat style popular in that era.\r\n\r\nThey then started working on a rock theater play “Omul 36/80” (The Man 36/80) which won several prizes for originality.\r\n\r\nIn 1969 Ioan “Pilu” Ştefanovici was replaced by Dorel “Baba” Vintilă Zaharia (born 1943). For the next year the band became more and more popular, frequently visiting Bucharest and being invited in talk shows about music.\r\n\r\nIn 1970, Moni Bordeianu emigrated to the US, and, for a brief period of time the band suspended its activity, also due to total censorship that followed a protesting speech held by Bordeianu in his last concert. 1970 meant the blues period of the band. The formula used was Nicu Covaci - guitar, Günther “Spitzly” Reininger - piano and voice, Zoltan Covacs - bass guitar and Liviu Butoi - oboe and flute. Phoenix was born again the next year, with Covaci, Josef Kappl, Mircea Baniciu, Costin Petrescu (replaced in 1974 by Ovidiu Lipan, nicknamed “Ţăndărică”) and Valeriu Sepi.\r\n\r\nBut the Communist officials were not very comfortable with the Western-style music that they were singing, and kept creating them problems. So Phoenix abandoned beat turned to Romanian folklore, pagan rituals, mystic animals and old traditions. In this same year, Phoenix started a collaboration with the Institute of Ethnography and Folklore and the Folklore section of Timişoara University on an ambitious project, a rock poem that combined traditional wooden instruments with modern sounds. During this project the band also started collaborating with Valeriu Sepi (born 1947), who eventually joined the band. The first outcome would be the 1972 LP Cei ce ne-au dat nume (Those Who Gave Us Our Names) - the first LP to be recorded in Romania by a Romanian band. Two years later, Mugur de fluier (Flute Bud) followed. Both albums underwent severe censorship.\r\n\r\nIn 1973 Phoenix represented Romania at the “Golden harp” festival in Bratislava (Slovakia) and then in the “Disc festival” in Sopot (Poland). Also, they wanted to record a new rock-opera, named “Meşterul Manole”, but the communist officials censored it all, by “losing” the unique book with costume sketches and lyrics given to them for official approval. The result was only a EP with an extract from the opera, Meşterul Manole, uvertură (Meşterul Manole, uverture) and two older songs, Mamă, Mamă (Mother, Mother) and Te întreb pe tine, soare… (I’m asking you, sun…).\r\n\r\nOn Monday, 19 November 1973, Phoenix held a memorable concert in Bucharest, presenting their new hits “Andri Popa”, “Pavel Chinezu” and “Strunga”, which composed the new disc “Mugur de fluier”. The new songs were still influenced by folklore yet had a new style. This style was the result of the collaboration with new songwriters Andrei Ujică and Şerban Foarţă. Based on those new songs Nicu Covaci created a new show “Introducere la un concert despre muzica veche la români” (“Introduction to a concert about old Romanian music”) in which he introduced violins, flutes, archaic percussion and other traditional instruments. The show was never finished due to a new collaboration with “Cenaclul Flacăra.” This period is considered the peak for Phoenix. Their sound was considered original and powerful and full stadiums were common for their concerts.\r\n\r\nEvery winter the members of the band would retreat to Mount Semenic and plan their upcoming songs. That winter the show “Zoosophia”, a title that would later change to “Cantafabule”, was created. The show began by “calling” all mythic animals and continued by dedicating a song to each of them, finishing with the Phoenix, the band’s symbol. The year 1975 brought a newcomer to the band, Ovidiu Lipan “Ţăndărică” (born 1953). The “Cantafabule” show was first presented in Timişoara in February 1975. The disc was recorded in a very short time and was published the same year with a misspelling in the title: “Cantofabule.” What followed were two years of almost continuous concerts but also the creation of the soundtrack for the movie “Nemuritorii”.\r\n\r\nBy this time, the popularity of Phoenix had grown huge; people loved their songs not only for what they were, but also because they contained thinly-veiled allusions to the Communist regime. The band members, especially Nicu Covaci, found themselves increasingly harassed by the Securitate. Covaci married a Dutch woman and left the country in 1976. He returned in 1977, bringing in relief aid for those struck by the powerful earthquake on March 4. After two grandiose concerts in Constanţa and Tulcea, Covaci surprisingly left the country again, this time with all the band members (except Baniciu) hidden inside their Marshall speakers - a huge undertaking, since in Communist Romania it was extremely difficult to obtain approval to travel abroad, and illegal border crossing was punished with imprisonment.\r\n\r\nAfter arriving in Germany, Phoenix disbanded. Kappl and a few others (Erlend Krauser, Ovidiu Lipan) formed a new band, Madhouse and released a not very successful album named From The East. In 1981, Covaci co-opted Neumann and Lipan and English bassist Tom Buggie, who had an amazing technical playing ability, under the name Transsylvania Phoenix (since a band named Phoenix already existed) and released an LP named Transsylvania, containing two old Phoenix songs translated into English to target the Western audience and five new ones. Covaci together with Kappl also released two EPs and one maxi single as Transsylvania-Phoenix.\r\n\r\nIn 1990 Phoenix made a triumphant comeback to Romania, with a highly emotional concert in their hometown Timişoara, the city that sparked the popular revolt in December 1989 that eventually led to the downfall of the Communist regime. In the following years, Phoenix toured a lot and released a few compilations of their older recordings. Internal frictions, especially between Covaci and Baniciu, were making headlines in the media.\r\n\r\nA new album appeared in 2000, the first original album after their 1990 comeback; with the exception of Covaci, the lineup comprised none of the members from the ’70s.\r\n\r\nIn 2002, the 40th Anniversary of the band brought together almost all former members in a supershow.\r\n\r\nAt the end of 2005 the band (in its classic gold lineup) released a new album, named Baba Novak.\r\n\r\nAs of 2010, the band still performs at live events.\r\n---\r\nAside from these two artists: The following groups also used the name Phoenix, most of which were short lived:\r\nPhoenix (3): A short-lived British hard rock band that consisted of Jim Rodford, Robert Henrit, John Verity of Argent.\r\nPhoenix (4): A UK-based band who play SF/Fantasy inspired rock / filk - both originals and parodies of better known songs.\r\nPhoenix (5): Phoenix is also a Classic goa / psychedelic trance project with some tracks released in compilations of 90s.\r\nPhoenix (6): A seven-piece Oklahoma City garage-soul band that released one 45 in 1969 and received great regional success for a couple of years.\r\nAllen Correll (Trumpet)\r\nLarry Rogers (keyboards)\r\nJohn Proctor (Drums)\r\nRon Jones (saxophone)\r\nRoger Harrison (Bass)\r\nRandy Stark (Vocals)\r\nPat Smiley (Guitar)\r\nPheonix (7): A British glitter band consisting of Alan Yates (vocals) Gerry Shepard (guitar/backing vocals) Pete Phipps (drums/keyboards) and Mike Leander (drums/bass/keyboards).

Gaining an early following as one of the first British psychedelic groups, they were distinguished by their extended compositions, sonic experimentation, philosophical lyrics and elaborate live shows. They became a leading band of the progressive rock genre, cited by some as the greatest progressive rock band of all time.\r\n\r\nPink Floyd were founded in 1965 by Syd Barrett (guitar, lead vocals), Nick Mason (drums), Roger Waters (bass guitar, vocals), and Richard Wright (keyboards, vocals). Under Barrett\'s leadership, they released two charting singles and the successful debut album The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967). Guitarist and vocalist David Gilmour joined in December 1967; Barrett left in April 1968 due to deteriorating mental health. Waters became the primary lyricist and thematic leader, devising the concepts behind the band\'s peak success with the albums The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977) and The Wall (1979). The musical film based on The Wall, Pink Floyd – The Wall (1982), won two BAFTA Awards. Pink Floyd also composed several film scores.\r\n\r\nFollowing personal tensions, Wright was pushed out of Pink Floyd in 1979, followed by Waters decision to leave in 1985. Gilmour and Mason continued as Pink Floyd, rejoined later by Wright. They produced two more albums—A Momentary Lapse of Reason (1987) and The Division Bell (1994)—and toured in support of both before entering a long hiatus. In 2005, all but Barrett reunited for a one-off performance at the global awareness event Live 8. Barrett died in 2006, and Wright in 2008. The last Pink Floyd studio album, The Endless River (2014), was created using unreleased material from the Division Bell recording sessions, along with new recordings. In 2022, Gilmour and Mason released the most recent Pink Floyd recording, the song \"Hey, Hey, Rise Up!\" in protest of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  As of 2024, the band is back on hiatus, with Gilmour stating his willingness to reconvene under the right circumstances.\r\n\r\nBy 2013, Pink Floyd had sold more than 250 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling music artists of all time. The Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall were inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, and these albums and Wish You Were Here are among the best-selling albums of all time. Four Pink Floyd albums topped the US Billboard 200, and five topped the UK Album Chart. Pink Floyd\'s hit singles include \"See Emily Play\" (1967), \"Money\" (1973), \"Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2\" (1979), \"Not Now John\" (1983), \"On the Turning Away\" (1987) and \"High Hopes\" (1994). They were inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005.

The group began as an outlet for John Dwyer to release his instrumental, experimental home recordings, and over the course of several albums evolved into a full band. The band is noted for both its prolific album releases, energetic live shows, and their whimsical visual aesthetic that juxtaposes cartoon imagery and horror. The band has changed its name several times, being known as Orinoka Crash Suite, OCS, Orange County Sound, The Ohsees, Thee Oh Sees. Some say John Dwyer (of Coachwhips, Pink & Brown, OCS, Landed, Yikes, Burmese, The Hospitals, Sword & Sandals, Superpit, The Drums, The Trawgs, Zeigenbock Kopf and Dig That Body Up It\'s Alive!) is in Thee Oh Sees and he seems to be making this band the most serious project. He\'s done everything from noise to death metal to punk and now Thee Oh Sees. \r\n\r\nThee Oh Sees are no doubt the lightest of his excursions, but in contrast to the rest of his resume one could surmise that there are significant reasons for the change. \r\n\r\nThee Oh Sees have a lo-fi electric-acoustic sound that\'s usually soaked in reverb, making it as if you can hear and see the exact room they recorded in. It creates a very distinct mood that seems to fit their style, lyrics, and melodies.\r\n\r\nWhat most people focus on is that Mr. Dwyer is in the band. While it\'s certainly a notable quality, the recent band members bring so much more to the table. The earliest recordings are Dwyer\'s solo recordings, mostly single instrument/vocal ditties that you can hear him working out. They\'re an intimate portrait of John, but without the recent material, the portrait would simply be incomplete. \r\n\r\nThee Oh Sees don\'t subscribe to any one style.\r\n\r\nWith the addition of Brigid Dawson, Petey Dammit, and a rotating cast of drummers, the sound has grown into the landscape that one man couldn\'t create alone. Brigid\'s soprano voice brings an almost hauntingly sensitive aspect to the lyrics and melodies, while Petey and Mike\'s pounding and insistent backline (and additional drums from Lars Finberg of The Intelligence on recent recordings) complete the frame in its entirety. Their energetic, sweat-laden shows coupled with their prolific recording schedule has garnered them a growing, dedicated fan base.  \r\n\r\nThe catalog that this band has put together is growing and growing, albeit under several different monikers, and several different labels. \r\n\r\nin 2017 it was announced that the band would change its name to simply \'Oh Sees\'\r\n\r\nin November of 2019, the band announced that they would be changing their name yet again to simply \'Osees\' <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Thee+Oh+Sees\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The band name was inspired after a sound called \"Metric\" that was programmed by Shaw on his keyboard. They were based at various times at Toronto, Montreal, London, NYC and LA.\r\n\r\nSo far, Metric has released eight studio albums: Old World Underground, Where Are You Now?

She also has been a guest on albums by Stars, The Crystal Method, KC Accidental, Delerium, The Stills and Jason Collett.\r\n\r\nEmily Haines was born in New Delhi, India and raised since the age of 3 in Peterborough, Ontario. The daughter of poet Paul Haines grew up as a dual citizen of Canada and India. Her father would often make cassettes of rare and eclectic music for his daughter to listen to and her early influences included Carla Bley and Robert Wyatt. By her teens she followed her parents\' footsteps by attending the Etobicoke School of the Arts. There she met Amy Millan and Kevin Drew, with whom she would later collaborate in hHead. Haines and Millan briefly formed their first band around 1990 while at ESA and with songs later written and recorded while at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver in 1992–1993, at Toronto in 1995 and at Concordia University in Montreal in 1995–1996, Haines distributed in 1996 an early effort called Cut in Half and Also Double with a limited number of copies.\r\n\r\nJames Shaw was born in the UK. He was a student at a Boston music school and was friends with Torquil Campbell, a vocalist who would later form Stars and Chris Seligman, the future synthesizer player of Stars. Torquil had plans to move to New York City and on his suggestion Shaw applied to Juilliard Music School and moved to New York with him. In 1998, Shaw and Torquil returned to Toronto, where Haines met Shaw through mutual friends in the local music scene. Shaw moved to Montreal where Haines was still living and the two worked on filling out each other\'s projects. The first song made by Shaw and Haines was \"Butcher\" and eventually they had completed in 1998 several other tracks in their home studio, gathered on Mainstream EP, a collection of demos with an overall downtempo and electronic feel.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1998, Shaw moved back to New York City, this time accompanied by Haines, Campbell and Seligman. There they shared a loft in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. During their two-year stay at the loft, Haines and Shaw were erstwhile room mates with future members of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Liars and TV on the Radio. \r\n\r\nHaines and Shaw set off to London in early 2000 and signed a publishing deal with Chrysalis Records. With the help of producer Stephen Hague, Metric worked on a new batch of New Wave/electropop drum-machine paced songs that would form the nucleus of their debut album. The effort dubbed Grow Up and Blow Away, revealed a more musically-layered and mature sound than the earlier Mainstream EP. Haines and Shaw completed the album in April 2001 and by this time had found a label for their release, Restless Records. The album was delayed for years by their record label. \r\n\r\nThe band performed in New York in early Spring and late Summer 2001, personally circulating handmade CD-R copies of their unreleased music to fans at shows and by mail, eventually giving the music away for free on the internet. Metric at the time was for the most part a studio band and live shows approximated the synthesizer-centered and drum-machine driven sound of the recordings. In the same year they issued a 5-track EP entitled Static Anonymity and two promo singles: \"Grow Up and Blow Away\" and \"Raw Sugar\".\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 2001, Metric had gained two new bandmates: the drummer Joules Scott-Key (born in Flint, Michigan) and the bass player Joshua Winstead. Joules Scott-Key was attending college in Texas was in town with his friend Joshua Winstead performing in the local music scene. Scott-Key and Winstead had known each other for about a decade and they met Shaw and Haines at the Brooklyn loft and at local performances.\r\n\r\nOn 2 September 2003, Metric released their first official studio album Old World Underground, Where Are You Now? on Last Gang Records. The album was received with positive reviews and it has gone gold in Canada. They released 2 singles from the album, \"Combat Baby\" and \"Dead Disco\".\r\n\r\nOn 27 September 2005, the band released their second studio album, Live It Out on Last Gang Records. The album was well received and has since gone twice platinum in Canada, selling over 200,000 units. They issued 4 singles: \"Monster Hospital\", \"Poster of a Girl\", and \"Empty\". The band has toured the world extensively for several years. They also opened for The Rolling Stones in NYC.\r\n\r\nOn 26 June 2007, Last Gang Records released Metric\'s 2001 album Grow Up and Blow Away, after purchasing the rights to the album from band\'s previous label. In 2007 they released a live EP entitled Live at Metropolis followed a year later by a DVD with the same name featuring a concert recorded from Montreal.\r\n\r\nOn 7 April 2009, Metric released their fourth album Fantasies on their own label, Metric Music International. In the US it debuted at #1 on Billboard\'s Top Heatseekers and peaked at #76 on the Billboard 200, in Canada it debuted at #13 on the Canadian Albums Chart and peaked at #6 and in Australia, the album debuted at #48. The album received mostly positive reviews and it\'s their most successful record to date. They released 6 singles: \"Help I\'m Alive\", \"Front Row\", \"Gimme Sympathy\", \"Sick Muse\", \"Gold Guns Girls\" and \"Stadium Love\".\r\n\r\nAmazon.com listed Fantasies in eleventh in its \"Best Albums of 2009\" list. This album was a shortlisted nominee for the 2009 Polaris Music Prize and also won two Casby Awards, the NXNE favourite new indie release award and favourite new album award. On 18 April 2010, the album won the Juno Award for Alternative Album of the Year at the 2010 Awards, as well as the band winning Group of the Year.\r\n\r\nOn 27 October 2009, Metric released a 5-track EP called Plug In Plug Out containing acoustic versions of five songs from Fantasies. During the 2010 Winter Olympics, Metric, along with several other Canadian music acts, came together in Vancouver to re-record K\'Naan\'s song \"Wavin\' Flag\" to benefit Haiti in a movement called Young Artists for Haiti. \r\n\r\nIn 2010, the band contributed to Twilight: Eclipse movie soundtrack with a song entitled \"Eclipse (All Yours)\". In the same year, a previously unreleased song \"Black Sheep\" was used on the soundtrack of the movie Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. In 2011, Metric issued the live EP iTunes Session.\r\n\r\nOn 18 September 2015, Metric released their sixth album, Pagans in Vegas.\r\n\r\nOn September 21, 2018, Metric released their seventh album, Art of Doubt.\r\n\r\nOn July 8, 2022, Metric released their eighth album, Formentera .\r\n\r\nOn October 13, 2023, Metric released their ninth album, Formentera II.\r\n\r\nEPs\r\nMainstream EP (1998)\r\nStatic Anonymity (2001)\r\nLive at Metropolis (2007)\r\nPlug In, Plug Out (2009)\r\nSpotify Acoustic EP (2010)\r\nSpotify Covers EP (2010)\r\niTunes Session EP (2011)\r\nThe Shade EP [Cassette only] (2015)\r\n\r\nwere featured in:\r\n3 films\r\nThe Twilight Saga: Eclipse\r\nScott Pilgrim vs. the World\r\nCosmopolis\r\n\r\n\"Handshakes\" and \"Gold Guns Girls\" were used as a radio soundtrack in Test Drive Unlimited.\r\n\r\nOfficial site: http://www.ilovemetric.com <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Metric\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The band became prominent in the Southern United States in 1973, and rose to worldwide recognition before three members and one road crew member died in an airplane crash in 1977. The band reformed in 1987 for a reunion tour with lead singer Ronnie Van Zant\'s younger brother Johnny as the frontman. Lynyrd Skynyrd continues to tour and record. Of its original members, only Gary Rossington remains with the band as of 2010. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on March 13, 2006.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nEarly years\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1964, teenage friends Ronnie Van Zant, Allen Collins, and Gary Rossington, formed the band \"The Noble Five\", which then changed in 1965 to \"My Backyard\", when Larry Junstrom and Bob Burns joined in Jacksonville, Florida. Their early influences included British Invasion bands such as Free, The Yardbirds, The Rolling Stones, and The Beatles, as well as Southern blues and country & western music. In 1968, the group won a local Battle of the Bands contest and the opening slot on several Southeast shows for the California-based psychedelic rock band Strawberry Alarm Clock.\r\n\r\nIn 1970, Van Zant sought a new name. \"One Percent\" and \"The Noble Five\" were each considered before the group settled on Leonard Skinnerd, a mocking tribute to a physical-education teacher at Robert E. Lee High School, Leonard Skinner, who was notorious for strictly enforcing the school\'s policy against boys having long hair. The more distinctive spelling was adopted before they released their first album. Despite their high school acrimony, the band developed a friendlier relationship with Skinner in later years, and invited him to introduce them at a concert in the Jacksonville Memorial Coliseum.\r\n\r\nIn 1970, the band auditioned for Alan Walden, who would later become their manager on the newly formed Hustler\'s Inc. Walden worked with the band until 1974, when management was turned over to Pete Rudge. The band continued to perform throughout the South in the early 1970s, further developing their hard-driving, blues-rock sound and image, and experimenting with making studio recordings.\r\n\r\nDuring this time, they went through a number of member changes, with Van Zant, Collins and Rossington remaining the only constants. Burns and Junstrom left the band, and were briefly replaced by Rickey Medlocke on drums and Greg Walker on bass. In 1971, with this lineup, they made some recordings at the famous Muscle Shoals studio. By the time they made a second round of Muscle Shoals recordings in 1972, Burns had rejoined the band and Leon Wilkeson had become Larry Junstrom\'s permanent replacement on bass, with Medlocke and Walker having left to play with the southern rock band Blackfoot. Around this time, the band occasionally played shows with both Burns and Medlocke participating, utilizing a dual-drummer approach similar to that of The Allman Brothers. Also in 1972, roadie Billy Powell became the keyboardist for the band.\r\n\r\nPeak years (1973–1977)\r\n\r\nIn 1972 the band was discovered by musician, songwriter, and producer Al Kooper of Blood, Sweat, and Tears, who had attended one of their shows at a club in Atlanta. They changed the spelling of their name to \"Lynyrd Skynyrd\", (pronounced \'lĕh-\'nérd \'skin-\'nérd) and Kooper signed them to MCA Records, producing their first album (pronounced \'lĕh-\'nérd \'skin-\'nérd). Leon Wilkeson left just before the band was to record the album (Wilkeson rejoined the band shortly thereafter at Van Zant\'s invitation and is pictured on the album cover).[citation needed] Strawberry Alarm Clock guitarist Ed King joined the band and played Wilkeson\'s parts on the album, along with some guitar. King switched to guitar after the album\'s release, allowing the band to replicate the three-guitar mix used in the studio. Released January 1, 1973, the album featured the hit song \"Free Bird\", which received national airplay, eventually reaching #19 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts, and is still considered a rock and roll anthem today.\r\n\r\nLynyrd Skynyrd\'s fan base continued to grow rapidly throughout 1973, largely due to their opening slot on The Who\'s Quadrophenia tour in the United States. On their 1974 follow-up, Second Helping, the band successfully avoided sophomore slump, with King, Collins and Rossington all collaborating with Van Zant on the songwriting. The album was the band\'s breakthrough hit, and featured their most popular single, \"Sweet Home Alabama\" (#8 on the charts in August 1974), a response to Neil Young\'s \"Alabama\" and \"Southern Man.\" (Young and Van Zant were not rivals, but fans of each other\'s music and good friends; Young even wrote the song \"Powderfinger\" for the band, but they never recorded it. Van Zant, meanwhile, can be seen on the cover of Street Survivors wearing a Neil Young t-shirt.) The album reached #12 in 1974, eventually going multi-platinum. In July of that year, Lynyrd Skynyrd was one of the headline acts at The Ozark Music Festival at the Missouri State Fairgrounds in Sedalia, Missouri.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1975, Burns left the band and was replaced by Kentucky native Artimus Pyle on drums. Lynyrd Skynyrd\'s third album, Nuthin\' Fancy, was released the same year. The album had lower sales than its predecessor, and Kooper was eventually fired. Midway through the tour, Ed King left the band, citing tour exhaustion. In January 1976, backup singers Leslie Hawkins, Cassie Gaines and JoJo Billingsley (collectively known as The Honkettes) were added to the band, although they were not considered as official members. Lynyrd Skynyrd\'s fourth album Gimme Back My Bullets was released in the new year, but did not achieve the same success as the previous two albums. Van Zant and Collins both felt that the band was seriously missing the three-guitar attack that had been one of its early hallmarks. Although Skynyrd auditioned several guitarists, including such high-profile names as Leslie West, the solution was closer than they realized.\r\n\r\nSoon after joining Skynyrd, Cassie Gaines began touting the guitar and songwriting prowess of her younger brother, Steve. The junior Gaines, who led his own band, Crawdad (which occasionally would perform Skynyrd\'s \"Saturday Night Special\" in their set), was invited to audition onstage with Skynyrd at a concert in Kansas City on May 11, 1976. Liking what they heard, the group also jammed informally with the Oklahoma native several times, then invited him into the group in June. With Gaines on board, the newly-reconstituted band recorded the double-live album One More From the Road at the Fox Theatre (Atlanta, Georgia) in Atlanta, and performed at the Knebworth festival, which also featured The Rolling Stones.\r\n\r\nBoth Collins and Rossington had serious car accidents over Labor Day weekend in 1976 which slowed the recording of the follow-up album and forced the band to cancel some concert dates. Rossington\'s accident inspired the ominous \"That Smell\" - a cautionary tale about drug abuse that was clearly aimed towards him and at least one other band member. Rossington has admitted repeatedly that he\'s the \"Prince Charming\" of the song who crashed his car into an oak tree while drunk and stoned on Quaaludes. Van Zant, at least, was making a serious attempt to clean up his act and curtail the cycle of boozed-up brawling that was part of Skynyrd\'s reputation.\r\n\r\n1977\'s Street Survivors turned out to be a showcase for guitarist/vocalist Steve Gaines, who had joined the band just a year earlier and was making his studio debut with them. Publicly and privately, Ronnie Van Zant marveled at the multiple talents of Skynyrd\'s newest member, claiming that the band would \"all be in his shadow one day.\" Gaines\' contributions included his co-lead vocal with Van Zant on the co-written \"You Got That Right\" and the rousing guitar boogie \"I Know A Little\" which he had written before he joined Skynyrd. So confident was Skynyrd\'s leader of Gaines\' abilities that the album (and some concerts) featured Gaines delivering his self-penned bluesy \"Ain\'t No Good Life\" - the only song in the pre-crash Skynyrd catalog to feature a lead vocalist other than Ronnie Van Zant. The album also included the hit singles \"What\'s Your Name\" and \"That Smell\". The band was poised for their biggest tour yet, including fulfilling Van Zant\'s lifelong dream of headlining New York\'s Madison Square Garden.\r\n\r\nPlane crash (1977)\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, October 20, 1977, just three days after the release of Street Survivors, and five shows into their most successful headlining tour to date, Lynyrd Skynyrd\'s chartered Convair 240 ran out of fuel near the end of their flight from Greenville, South Carolina, where they had just performed at the Greenville Memorial Auditorium, to LSU in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Though the pilots attempted an emergency landing on a small airstrip, the plane crashed in a forest in Gillsburg, Mississippi. Ronnie Van Zant, Steve Gaines, Cassie Gaines, assistant road manager Dean Kilpatrick, pilot Walter McCreary and co-pilot William Gray were all killed on impact; the other bandmembers suffered serious injuries.\r\n\r\nFollowing the crash and the ensuing press, Street Survivors became the band\'s second platinum album and reached #5 on the U.S. album chart. The single \"What\'s Your Name\" reached #13 on the single airplay charts in January 1978.\r\n\r\nThe original cover sleeve for Street Survivors had featured a photograph of the band, particularly Steve Gaines, engulfed in flames. Out of respect for the deceased (and at the request of Teresa Gaines, Steve\'s widow), MCA Records withdrew the original cover and replaced it with a similar image of the band against a simple black background. Thirty years later, for the deluxe CD version of Street Survivors, the original \"flames\" cover was restored.\r\n\r\nLynyrd Skynyrd disbanded after the tragedy, reuniting just once to perform an instrumental version of \"Free Bird\" at Charlie Daniels\' Volunteer Jam in January 1979. Collins, Rossington, Powell and Pyle performed the song with Charlie Daniels and members of his band. Leon Wilkeson, who was still undergoing physical therapy for his badly broken left arm, was in attendance, along with Judy Van Zant, Teresa Gaines, JoJo Billingsley and Leslie Hawkins.\r\n\r\nHiatus (1977–1987)\r\n\r\nRossington, Collins, Wilkeson and Powell formed The Rossington-Collins Band, which released two albums between 1980 and 1982. Deliberately avoiding comparisons with Ronnie Van Zant as well as suggestions that this band was Lynyrd Skynyrd reborn, Rossington and Collins chose a woman, Dale Krantz, as lead vocalist. However, as an acknowledgment of their past, the band\'s concert encore would always be an instrumental version of \"Free Bird\". Rossington and Collins eventually had a falling out over the affections of Dale Krantz, whom Rossington married and with whom he formed the Rossington Band, which released two albums in the late 1980s and opened for the Lynyrd Skynyrd Tribute Tour in 1987-1988.\r\n\r\nThe other former members of Lynyrd Skynyrd continued to make music during the hiatus era.Leon Wilkeson on bass and  Billy Powellon keyboards played  in a Christian Rock band named Vision, touring with established Christian rocker Mylon LeFevre (who, like Skynyrd, had once opened for The Who). During Vision concerts, Powell\'s trademark keyboard talent was often spotlighted and he spoke about his conversion to Christianity after the near-fatal plane crash. Pyle formed The Artimus Pyle Band in 1982, which occasionally featured former Honkettes JoJo Billingsley and Leslie Hawkins.\r\n\r\nIn 1980 Allen Collins\' wife Kathy died of a massive hemorrhage while miscarrying their third child. He formed the Allen Collins Band in 1983 from the remnants of the Rossington-Collins Band, releasing one tepidly-received album, but many around him believed that the guitarist\'s heart just wasn\'t in it anymore. Most point to his wife\'s death as the moment that Collins\' life began to spin out of control; he spent several years bingeing on drugs and alcohol. In 1986 Collins crashed his car while driving drunk near his home in Jacksonville, killing his girlfriend and leaving him permanently paralyzed from the chest down. Collins eventually pled no contest to DUI manslaughter, but was not given a prison sentence since his injuries made it obvious that he would never drive or be a danger to society again.\r\n\r\nReturn (1987–present)\r\n\r\nIn 1987, Lynyrd Skynyrd reunited for a full-scale tour with five major members of the post-crash band: crash survivors Gary Rossington, Billy Powell, Leon Wilkeson and Artimus Pyle, along with guitarist Ed King, who had left the band two years before the crash. Ronnie Van Zant\'s younger brother, Johnny, took over as the new lead singer and primary songwriter. Due to Collins\' paralysis from the 1986 car accident, he was only able to participate as the musical director, choosing Randall Hall, his former bandmate in the Allen Collins Band, as his stand-in. As part of his plea deal, Collins would be wheeled out onstage each night to explain to the audience why he could no longer perform (usually before the performance of \"That Smell\", which had been partially directed at him). Collins was stricken with pneumonia in 1989 and died on January 23, 1990.\r\n\r\nThe reunited band was meant to be a one-time tribute to the original lineup, captured on the double-live album Southern By The Grace Of God/Lynyrd Skynyrd Tribute Tour - 1987. The fact that the band chose to continue after the 1987 tribute tour caused legal problems for the survivors, as Judy Van Zant Jenness and Teresa Gaines Rapp (widows of Ronnie and Steve, respectively) sued the others for violating an agreement made shortly after the plane crash, stating that they would not \"exploit\" the Skynyrd name for profit. As part of the settlement, Jenness and Rapp collect nearly 30% of the band\'s touring revenues (representing the shares their husbands would have earned had they lived), and hold a proviso which forces any band touring as \"Lynyrd Skynyrd\" to include at least two from among Rossington, Collins, Powell, Pyle, Wilkeson and King. Apparently, that proviso is not being enforced, seeing that Rossington is now the sole member of that group left in Lynyrd Skynyrd, as King was not allowed to remain in the band after missing a tour unable to tour due to heart problems, Pyle is on the outs with Rossington and Johnny Van Zant, and the others are now dead. Pyle has insisted in public appearances that \"Ronnie Van Zandt IS Lynyrd Skynyrd\", and wishes nothing to do with the current makeup of the band bearing that name. Two other founding members of the band remain alive, original drummer Bob Burns and bassist Larry Junstrom Bob Burns, but they have not participated in the post-crash band.\r\n\r\nThe reconstituted Lynyrd Skynyrd has gone through a large number of lineup changes and continues to record and tour today. One by one, the members of the pre-crash band have left, been forced out, or have passed away. Artimus Pyle left the band in 1991 and his place has been taken by a variety of drummers since, with Michael Cartellone finally becoming his permanent replacement. Randall Hall was replaced by Mike Estes in 1993. Ed King had to take a break from touring in 1996. In his absence, he was replaced by Hughie Thomasson. King has stated that his break from the band was to be temporary, but the band did not let him rejoin after he recovered. At the same time, Mike Estes was replaced by Rickey Medlocke, who had briefly played drums with the band in the early 1970\'s. Leon Wilkeson, Skynyrd\'s bassist since 1972, was found dead in his hotel room on July 27, 2001; his death was found to be due to emphysema and chronic liver disease. He was replaced in 2001 by Ean Evans. The remaining members released a double album called Thyrty which had songs from the original line up to the present. Lynyrd Skynyrd also released a live DVD of their Vicious Cycle Tour and on June 22, 2004, Lynyrd Skynyrd released the album Lyve: The Vicious Cycle Tour. On December 10, 2004, Lynyrd Skynyrd did a show for CMT, Crossroads, a concert featuring country duo Montgomery Gentry and other genres of music. In the beginning of 2005 Hughie Thomasson left the band to reform his disbanded Southern Rock band Outlaws. Thomasson died in his sleep on September 9, 2007 of an apparent heart attack in his home in Brooksville, Florida. He was 55 years old.\r\n\r\nOn February 5, 2005, Lynyrd Skynyrd did a Super Bowl party back in Jacksonville with special guests 3 Doors Down, Jo Dee Messina, Charlie Daniels and Ronnie and Johnny Van Zant\'s brother Donnie Van Zant of 38 Special. On February 13 of that year Lynyrd Skynyrd did a tribute to Southern Rock on the Grammy Awards with Gretchen Wilson, Tim McGraw, Keith Urban and Dickey Betts. On May 10, 2005, Johnny and Donnie Van Zant released a country album called Get Right with the Man which featured the hit single \"Help Somebody\". In the summer of 2005, lead singer Johnny Van Zant had to have surgery on his vocal cord to have a polyp removed. He was told not to sing for three months. On September 10, 2005, Lynyrd Skynyrd performed without Johnny Van Zant at the Music Relief Concert for the victims of Hurricane Katrina, with Kid Rock standing in for Johnny. In December 2005, Johnny Van Zant returned to sing for Lynyrd Skynyrd. The band performed live at Freedom Hall in Louisville, Kentucky, as a part of their 2007 tour. The concert was recorded in high definition for HDNet and premiered on December 1, 2007.\r\nThe band in 2008\r\n\r\nMark \"Sparky\" Matejka, formerly of the country music band Hot Apple Pie, joined Lynyrd Skynyrd in 2006 as Thomasson\'s replacement. On November 2, 2007, the band performed at Gator Growl, the world\'s largest student-run pep rally, in Ben Hill Griffin Stadium - also known as \"The Swamp.\" The event\'s 50,000-person attendance marked the largest crowd that Lynyrd Skynyrd had ever played in front of in the United States, until the July 2008 Bama Jam in Enterprise, Alabama where more than 111,000 people were in attendance.\r\n\r\nOn January 28, 2009, keyboardist Billy Powell died at age 56 at his home near Jacksonville, Florida. Powell called 911 at 12:55 a.m., complaining of shortness of breath. He had previously missed his doctor\'s appointment on the day before his death; the appointment was for a checkup on his heart. The EMS responders found Powell unconscious and unresponsive, with the telephone still in his hand. Rescue crews performed CPR, but he was pronounced dead at 1:52 a.m. Although a heart attack was suspected, and it was originally reported that an autopsy was to be performed, none in fact was ever done. Powell\'s death left Gary Rossington as the sole pre-crash member of the band, unless Rickey Medlocke\'s brief stint with the band in the early 1970\'s is counted. On March 17, 2009, it was announced that Skynyrd had signed a worldwide deal with Roadrunner Records, in association with their label, Loud & Proud Records, and released their new album God & Guns on September 29 of that year. They toured Europe and the United States in 2009 with Peter Keys of the 420 Funk Mob on keyboards and Robert Kearns of The Bottle Rockets on bass (in place of Ean Evans, who died of cancer at age 48 on May 6, 2009, at his home in Columbus, Mississippi). Scottish rock band Gun have been confirmed as special guests for the UK leg of Skynyrds tour in 2010.\r\n\r\nLeonard Skinner, the physical education teacher who inspired the name Lynyrd Skynyrd passed away on September 21st, 2010 <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Lynyrd+Skynyrd\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

They inspired her to take up guitar as a hobby. Sayuri began composing music during her second year of junior high school, aspiring to the lyrics and songwriting of Kanjani Eight.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, under the name Asuka, she joined an acoustic duo called LONGTAL based in Fukuoka, she started performing in the streets and live houses of places like Hiroshima, Osaka, and Nagoya. By this time, she had dropped out of high school.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, as part of LONGTAL, Sayuri was awarded the Grand Prix at the finals of the fifth Music Revolution, a competition sponsored by Yamaha Music. Afterwards, she became active as an indie artist. She adopted the name Sanketsu Shōjo Sayuri (酸欠少女さユり, lit. \"Hypoxia Girl Sayuri\") which is symbolic of her calling herself a 2.5-dimensional parallel singer-songwriter.\r\n\r\nSayuri moved to Tokyo in 2013. She held her first solo live in March 2015 at Tsutaya O-East in Tokyo. Later that year, Sayuri made her major debut at 18, performing the ending theme song for Rampo Kitan: Game of Laplace.\r\n\r\nOn December 7, 2016, she collaborated with Yojiro Noda of RADWIMPS to release her 4th single \"Furaregai Girl.\" Concerning the single, Noda said, \"I had already composed the song and created the lyrics, but I knew that I couldn\'t sing it. For a while, I searched for the true owner of the song. Then, by chance, I was in the recording studio next to Sayuri. I listened to her CD, and in that moment, something that was only a vague silhouette of a song became crystal clear. It was a song that she was meant to sing.\"\r\n\r\nOn March 1, 2017, Sayuri released her fifth single \"Parallel Line,\" which was featured as the ending song to the anime adaptation of Scum\'s Wish. She released her first album Mikazuki no Koukai on May 17, 2017. It reached first on Oricon\'s Daily Album Ranking and 3rd on its Weekly Album Ranking. This was a significant jump from her previous singles and a milestone in her career.

He rose to prominence as the guitarist and lead vocalist of the rock duo The White Stripes (1997-2011) and, after that, as the guitarist and vocalist of The Raconteurs, and drummer and vocalist for the band The Dead Weather, two bands that are still active on and off. White is also a recording artist in his own right and under his own name.\r\n\r\nJack White first played as a professional musician in the early 1990s, as a drummer for the Detroit cowpunk band Goober & the Peas. White produced Loretta Lynn\'s Van Lear Rose in 2004, which won them a Grammy for best country album, and an additional Grammy for best country collaboration for the song \'Portland Oregon\'.  \r\n\r\nWhite\'s début solo single, \'Love Interruption\', was made available on 30 January 2012 at White\'s pay-to-join club Vault and on jackwhiteiii.com. A week later, it was released on the singer’s preferred format, vinyl. Recorded at his own Third Man Studio in Nashville it was paired with the exclusive non-LP B-side, \'Machine Gun Silhouette\'. The single was followed by his first solo album, Blunderbuss, later in 2012.\r\n\r\nMore solo albums followed: Lazaretto (2014), Boarding House reach (2018), Fear of the Dawn (2022), Entering Heaven Alive (2022) and, perhaps his loudest rocking and most White Stripe-ish sounding solo album to date, No Name (2024). <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Jack+White\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

I grew up in Adel, a small rural town in south central Georgia about 40 miles north of the GA/FL border. My parents were raised by poor sharecroppers and music played a large role in their hard day to day lives. Singing in church and listening to the Grand Ole Opry radio was a great source of musical entertainment. My mom\'s high soprano and my father\'s deep bass put me somewhere in the middle. They used to listen to the local AM radio station which featured gospel, country, pop, soul and Paul Harvey at noon. They also joined the Columbia Record Club and not only did I get to listen to Fat\'s Domino and Johnny Cash, they let me have a selection and that first choice was Rubber Soul by The Beatles. What a huge impact! Until then I thought The Beatles were just \"yeah yeah yeah!\" This was my favorite pop/rock band obviously inspired by Bob Dylan. So then there was Dylan. Now not only could I mimic The Beatles, but I could also write songs that expressed my every emotion. I started a band before I could even play the guitar. I traded my record player for my first guitar and the strings were so high off the neck that they could cut your fingers. My mother bought me a Mel Bay Chord Book and I went to town. I wrote song after song and formed band after band with my friends. Then a friend and I bought a Sears 4 track reel to reel and I started recording everything and everybody. Every reel of tape was an album. Eventually we would transfer a reel to 8 tracks and sell them to friends. We would pass around our lyric books to girls and we were rock stars in our own little world. We would play for 4-H Club events, church functions, and parties. This went on through high school.\r\n\r\nI went on to South Georgia College where I met other musicians. I went there as a music major, but I was seriously looking into music in a much more major sort of way. I met Sparky Smith among many others and not only was he my bass player, but he became a forever trustworthy friend. Then there was Hans Van Brackle who I had already hooked up with in high school and Van Whiddon, Jimmy Whiddon and Sparky\'s buddy Don Anderson. There were others, like Don Fleming our amazing manager, but this was the nucleus of what would become my band Abacus. We played proms, VFW dances and parties mixing covers with our original music. It worked for the most part but we felt there had to be more, at least I did. We had a good grouping of original songs and we went to Atlanta to find a studio to record a demo. I grew up listening to the LeFevre Gospel Family and knew they had a fine studio in Atlanta so we went there first. There we were introduced to their head engineer Stan Dacus. He seemed like a nice cool guy so we booked a session there. We often rehearsed at Sparky\'s parents\' house in Broxton, GA and his mom liked us quite a bit so she said she would pay for us to record our first serious demo. The session went great, Dacus was impressed and I had the fever to do something serious. I had a wonderful band, but it was hard for us all to get on the same page about recording. This frustrated me a little and I couldn\'t wait to sort it all out and do something. I told Stan Dacus that I wanted to do a solo album and he said he would like to help. I let him listen to some of the old tapes of my music and he said let\'s get started ASAP. I took out a loan at my local bank and booked some time at LeFevre in Atlanta. I told my band what I was doing and asked them if they would like to participate. They were all on board to get the opportunity to record so we began rehearsing. We got real tight with the music I had selected and soon in the summer of 1976 we started recording. We would lay down the basic tracks with a guide vocal, then we would add overdubs with instruments and serious vocals. Stan was helpful in getting the time we needed. We would book 4 hours and get 6. We spent serious time mixing. I introduced some new effects, especially a flanger which enabled us to get a sound that stood out over other music of that time. I may have thought at some point we went overboard but in retrospect I think we were dead on as far as capturing the sounds I was hearing in my heart and mind. We had vinyl and 8 tracks made, Danny Dickens (a college art major friend) did the cover art, and Music and Dreams became a reality. There was Georgia success and maybe some north Florida, but not nearly enough airplay and not enough money to do gigs to do the album justice. Music and Dreams became a small town success with a big debt to pay. I later recorded two songs (\"Blues Stay Away\" and \"Warm Horizons\") for a 45 rpm single as a possible leader to a follow-up LP but that was not to be realized.\r\n\r\nThirty some odd years later, someone in California heard \"April Suzanne\" on the Internet and interest in my original music re-emerged. Douglas McGowan of Yoga Records in Los Angeles called Stan Dacus. Stan then called me and I got back with Douglas and the reissue ball started rolling and picked up some good moss. Douglas pitched Music and Dreams to Mexican Summer in New York where Keith Abrahamson immediately wanted to reissue the album in it\'s original form on vinyl. This successfully took place in early 2010.\r\n\r\nAnother company in South Korea, Riverman Music, wanted to reissue Music and Dreams in CD format to also include the singles \"Blues Stay Away\" and \"Warm Horizons\" as bonus material. This proved to be a very successful reissue and is already in it\'s second production run. This also took place in early 2010.\r\n\r\nWith so much buzz going on with the reissues, I decided to try to put a new band together. This took place over a period of about 9 months with local Jacksonville, Florida musicians that I had befriended along my life\'s journey and we were invited to play at the CMJ (College Music Journal) Festival in New York City this past October. We immediately focused on that one special gig and we went to New York and received excellent reviews. We played to a sold out crowd at the Knitting Factory in Brooklyn and I watched complete strangers sing my songs along with me as we performed under the hot stage lights. To finally be recognized and appreciated after 30 plus years was so completely gratifying and surreal. In many ways my music and dreams have been born again and I am now looking forward to what this rebirth will bring to me and to everyone who will share it with me. God bless and keep everyone who has shared in this musical adventure. Thank you so very much!\r\n\r\nNov. 2010\r\n\r\nRobert Lester Folsom <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Robert+Lester+Folsom\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The group released their debut LP Babylon in July 2002, with sporadic success in parts of Europe and the U.S. metal underground. However after suffering years of indifference and waning support from Earache Records with Dub War and now seeing the same lack of label support from RCA for Skindred, Rose and Ford amicably left the band in November of 2002, but would continue to offer their support.\r\n\r\nSoon Webbe had hooked up with guitarist Mikey Dee, and drummer Dirty Arya and continued on, but it wasn\'t until a year or so later and Lava Records\' involvement that the album really took off.

His discography includes top-charting hits like \"Savior, Please\", \"Before the Morning\", \"I Refuse\", \"Fall Apart\", \"Pushing Back The Dark\", and \"Revolutionary\".\r\n\r\nDrawing on musical influences as diverse as pop, folk, and good old-fashioned rock ‘n’ roll, Josh Wilson’s Life Is Not A Snapshot creates a rollicking atmosphere of electrically charged sonic satisfaction. From the jangling guitars on “Sing,” to the thought-provoking cadence of “Before The Morning” and the Beatle-esque strains of “Do You Want To Know,” Josh creates melodic flights of fancy that take you on a journey beyond what is to what should be. Fans will be compelled to sing along with his little-bit-rock ‘n’ roll treatment of “Listen,” tap their toes to “How To Fall,” and ponder along with the intimate ballad, “Right in Front of Me.” On his richly textured, gently nuanced performance of the world’s most famous hymn, “Amazing Grace,” Josh Wilson directs listeners beyond the performance and toward the Giver of all good gifts.\r\n\r\n“We may live in snapshot moments,” Josh says, “but those moments are not Life. Life is not one point in time but all of the points in time between drawing our first and last breaths. Because we have experienced the faithfulness of God in the past we can be secure in the present and trust in the One who holds the future.”\r\nThere is a school of thought that dictates what a typical rock star bio should look like. Open with a snappy quote to catch the reader’s attention. Include a laundry list of accolades, weighty references to his current standing on the album sales and radio charts as well as testimonials from well-respected industry insiders regarding his future greatness. Convince the reader that the artist in question is successful, talented and - in the case of Christian rock stars -considerably more spiritually creative than the average Joe who occupies the pew next to you on any given Sunday. \r\n\r\nJosh Wilson simply smiles and shakes his head at the absurdity of it all. You see, Josh Wilson is not a rock star - never has been; doesn’t intend to be. So if you are looking for one, you’ll just have to look someplace else.\r\n\r\nThat’s not to say Josh isn’t an incredibly talented singer/songwriter with numerous accolades and a brilliant future ahead of him. His debut album, Trying to Fit the Ocean in a Cup, resonated with a growing legion of fans across the nation, spawning the Top 10 radio hit, “Savior Please,” while launching him on tours with such celebrated artists as Big Daddy Weave and Matthew West. And though he would deny charges of being a guitar prodigy, Josh’s mesmerizing abilities have elicited awed comparisons, with terms like ‘Keaggy-esque’ being bandied about.\r\n\r\n“Please don’t hang that on me,” Josh smiles. “Playing guitar is a passion for me, and I do enjoy playing. But you never arrive. You never become the best, and that’s not what I’m trying to do anyway. I want to take some lessons and brush up on my playing because honestly, I’m a little rusty.”\r\n\r\nA little rusty for someone who studied under the tutelage of classical guitar legend, David Brandon, is like firing on all cylinders for the rest of the guitar-playing world. As phenomenal as his musicianship is, it is the lyrical integrity of his songs that remains Josh Wilson’s magnificent obsession, though he admits to wrestling with words like Jacob with the angel and sometimes walks away from his own songwriting sessions with a limp.\r\n\r\n“I have a passion for songwriting, but I don’t think I would say that while I am in the middle of writing a song,” Josh muses. “Songwriting is hard work, and I’ll procrastinate and avoid it at all costs. It is absolutely the ground fighting back against man’s efforts to till the soil. Melodies come to me a lot easier than words, but lyrics are where the weight of the song is. The melody may stick in someone’s head, but eventually they are going to start thinking about the words. That’s why I feel so much pressure. Ultimately, it doesn’t matter if you write a good song with a great hook if the words are meaningless. It is a daunting task and a big responsibility. I do not to take it lightly.”\r\n\r\nThat undeniable tension between the words and music emerges as a focal point of Josh’s sophomore CD, Life Is Not A Snapshot. This seven-song collection of contemporary theological musings reflects Josh’s remarkable penchant for framing cold and calculated questions of faith into wild, unbridled musical expressions of trust. \r\n\r\n“I am a pastor’s kid and grew up in the church,” Josh explains. “I don’t remember a time when I didn’t believe in Jesus, but my faith was never really challenged until I went to college. During my freshman year, I encountered people who were nice and smart, but who didn’t believe what I believed, and they started to challenge my faith. I didn’t have the foundation I needed to come up against those questions. A lot of things that I thought I knew started to fall apart. The Lord picked me up and said, ‘There are good answers to these questions, but you’re going to have to do some searching and praying and ask some smart questions yourself to figure out why you believe what you believe.’”\r\n\r\nHard work and seeking answers became a passion for the young singer/songwriter, and his songs have become richer as a result. In the two years since his critically acclaimed debut release, Josh has discovered a marked clarity regarding his vision and mission for his music, and it is aimed squarely at followers of Christ.\r\n\r\n“I feel like I am called to challenge and encourage the Church,” he declares. “I want to make people think, particularly about why they believe what they believe. As soon as your faith is challenged, that is when you’ll realize that Sunday school answers are not enough. Hopefully I can encourage people to dig deeper into their faith.” <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Josh+Wilson\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

They were the first Australian rock group to enjoy sustained commercial success in the United States. During their career the band have sold more than 25 million records and scored 13 American Top 40 hits.\r\n\r\nWhile fronted by singer John Farnham from 1982–1986, the band\'s original members were Glenn Shorrock (vocals), Graeham Goble, Beeb Birtles and Ric Formosa (guitars and vocals), Roger McLachlan (bass) and Derek Pellicci (drums).\r\n\r\nThe group evolved from the harmony-rock group Mississippi in 1975. Prior to that, Birtles had been the bassist in 1960s pop band Zoot (which also included singer-guitarist Rick Springfield), and Shorrock had been the lead singer of leading Australian 60s pop band The Twilights and early 1970s country rock band Axiom.\r\n\r\nThey found immediate success in Australia, but individual members had greater ambitions. Like many other Australasian groups of the period, both Axiom and Mississippi had tried to break into the UK record market without success. Remembering the indifferent reaction they had received in the UK, they decided the new band would focus on establishing themselves in the United States.\r\n\r\nA key factor in their eventual success was their manager Glenn Wheatley, who had been the bassist in the highly-regarded Australian rock band The Masters Apprentices. Wheatley\'s first-hand experiences of the rip-offs in the 1960s music scene, combined with his subsequent experience working in music management in Britain and the United States in the early 1970s, enabled him to help LRB become the first Australian group to enjoy sustained commercial and chart success in the United States.\r\n\r\nFuelled by a very successful Australian hit single \"Curiosity Killed The Cat\", the band began making promotional visits to the US in 1976. This resulted in a hit single, \"It\'s A Long Way There\", which broke into the Top 30 and galvanised the commitment of the band members. More concert performances in the US followed, and in 1977 \"Help Is On Its Way\" (an Australian number one single) and \"Happy Anniversary\"[4] both narrowly missed the US Top 10. During this period McLachlan left the group and was replaced by George McArdle while lead guitarist Formosa was replaced by David Briggs.\r\n\r\nFrom 1978 until 1981, Little River Band achieved six consecutive US Top 10 singles with \"Reminiscing\", \"Lady\", \"Lonesome Loser\", \"Cool Change\", \"The Night Owls\"  and \"Take It Easy On Me\". During their career the band have sold more than 25 million records and scored 13 American Top 40 hits.\r\n\r\nBassist/vocalist Wayne Nelson joined in 1980 and is currently the lead singer. In 1981 he sang lead vocals on their top ten US hit \"Night Owls\". Guitarist Stephen Housden joined the band in 1981 replacing David Briggs. Housden owns the rights to the name Little River Band. He co-wrote the band\'s last hit in Australia \"Love is a Bridge\".\r\n\r\nIn 1982 Shorrock was forced out of the band and went on to pursue a solo career. He failed to make an impression in the U.S., but he had a substantial hit in Australia with a cover version of Bobby Darin\'s \"Dream Lover\".\r\n\r\nThe pressures of success and constant touring gradually took their toll on LRB and members gradually left. John Farnham replaced Shorrock in 1982 and the first single with Farnham, \"The Other Guy\" reached #11 in the US. Subsequent singles were only minor hits. In Australia the band continued to be popular and songs such as \"Down On The Border\", \"Playing To Win\" and \"Love is a Bridge\" were major hits. Farnham\'s popularity in Australia was increasing at this time, and he left the band to return to his solo career, achieving huge success in Australia (he was also managed by Wheatley).\r\n\r\nBirtles left in 1983 because he did not like the direction the band was taking and he was not a fan of Farnham\'s onstage performance. Farnham left in 1986 to be replaced by the returning Shorrock. Goble left the group in 1990. Shorrock left again in 1996; he was offered the option to buy out the remaining members but he decided instead to take a payment. Derek Pellicci left the band in 1999.\r\n\r\nLittle River Band are considered to be among Australia\'s most significant bands. The \"classic lineup\" of the band (Birtles, Shorrock, Goble, Pellicci, Briggs and McArdle) were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame at the 18th Annual ARIA Music Awards of 2004. They performed \"Help Is On Its Way\" that night.\r\n\r\nThree founding members, Birtles, Shorrock and Goble, continue to perform reunion concerts but due to the fact they lost the rights to the name Little River Band, they appear under the name Birtles Shorrock Goble: The Original Voices of Little River Band.\r\n\r\n\"Reminiscing\", written by Goble, was recognised by BMI as one of the most frequently played songs in the history of American radio, with more than four million plays to its credit. \"Lady\" has also accumulated more than three million plays, and Goble is the first and only Australian songwriter ever to win a Four \"Million Air\" award from BMI. According to Albert Goldman\'s biography, John Lennon named \"Reminiscing\" as one of his favorite songs.\r\n\r\nLittle River Band continues to work in the US and performs around 100 shows every year. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Little+River+Band\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Formed in 2001 in New York City, New York, United States, the music of LCD Soundsystem can also be described as a mix of alternative dance and post punk, along with elements of disco and other styles. \r\n\r\nDuring the band\'s final years, Murphy was accompanied by Al Doyle (guitar, percussion -- also of Hot Chip), Tyler Pope (!!! / Out Hud) (bass), Nancy Whang (keyboards) and Pat Mahoney (drums). Members that played live with Murphy under the LCD Soundsystem name before this time include Phil Mossman (guitar, percussion) and Phil Skarich (bass).\r\n\r\nLCD Soundsystem gained attention with its first single, \"Losing My Edge\". The song, which sounds like the boastings of a music geek put to an electronic beat, received acclaim in 2002. Murphy released a double album simply titled LCD Soundsystem in February of 2005 to critical acclaim. The first disk of the album contains new music and the second contains re-releases of songs previously released as singles. The opening track \"Daft Punk Is Playing At My House\" entered the UK Top 40 in March 2005.\r\n\r\nOn December 8, 2005 the group received nominations for two Grammys in the Electronica category for their self-titled album and in the Dance category for \"Daft Punk Is Playing At My House\". This album was also chosen as one of Amazon.com\'s Top 100 Editor\'s Picks of 2005.\r\n\r\nIn March 2007, the band released their second album entitled Sound Of Silver. The album has spawned four singles including \"North American Scum\", \"All My Friends\", \"Someone Great\" and \"Time To Get Away\". Sound Of Silver saw a move towards a more traditional song writing approach whilst still maintaining the production values of their eponymous debut effort. This has resulted in the album appearing in numerous critic\'s end of year lists and another Grammy nomination for best electronic/dance album of 2007.\r\n\r\nOn November 18, 2008 Al Doyle seemed to suggest in an interview with 6 Music that the band would soon be discontinued. However, the following day both Doyle and James Murphy quashed this rumor, with Murphy indicating a new LCD Soundsystem album was on the way. Murphy began recording in the summer of 2009 in Los Angeles. Possible song titles mentioned at that time included \"Why Do You Hate Music?\" and \"Love in LA.\" For the 2009 Record Store Day the band released a cover of Suicide member Alan Vega\'s song \"Bye Bye Bayou\".\r\n\r\nOn February 23, 2010, the official LCD Soundsystem website announced that the album had been completed. The first single was set to be \"Drunk Girls\" and on March 25, a stream of the song was put on music site One Thirty BPM. The title of the album and the cover were revealed on the DFA site on March 30. The album, titled This Is Happening, was released in the UK on May 17, 2010 and in the US on May 18, 2010. Prior to the release Murphy promised that it will be \"definitely better than the other two.\" Murphy also stated that it was likely to be the last LCD Soundsystem album.\r\n\r\nOn February 5th, 2011, Murphy announced the band\'s breakup, citing an interest in pursuing other projects as a record producer. The same day, the band\'s final performance was announced -- their biggest headlining show ever at New York\'s Madison Square Garden on April 2nd of 2011. In the show\'s controversial onsale, the arena sold out in seconds due to scalpers allegedly buying tickets in mass amounts, and denying the opportunity for most fans to buy tickets. After public outrage, the band announced four more shows at New York\'s Terminal 5, to take place the week before the final show at MSG.\r\n\r\nOn January 5th, 2016, James announced the band\'s reunion, a new album to be released 2016, and a tour, \"not just playing coachella. we’re playing all over\".\r\nOfficial site: http://lcdsoundsystem.com <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/LCD+Soundsystem\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The band\'s first performances were in New York, in May 2006, to support the release of their debut album, Gulag Orkestar.\r\n\r\nCondon recorded before Beirut was established: when he was fifteen and under the name of Realpeople, he made an electronic record, fashioned after his love for The Magnetic Fields. Condon was a straight-A student until he dropped out at the age of 17 to travel Europe with his cousin in a drunken haze, cavorting and partying with the locals wherever he ended up. It was during one of these evenings that he was first exposed to Balkan music (notably including the Boban Marković Orkestar and Goran Bregović), blasting from the upstairs apartment. Condon ended up with the Serbian artists all night, going through albums country by country, note for note. \r\n\r\nThe first album under the Beirut moniker, Gulag Orkestar (2006), was the direct result of what he learned that night. While it may sound like an entire Balkan orchestra playing modern songs as mournful ballads and upbeat marches, the album was performed and recorded almost entirely by Condon alone. He did so on Pro Tools while skipping school in Albuquerque and at Sea Side Studios in Park Slope, Brooklyn. Jeremy Barnes added percussion and some violin overlays.\r\n\r\nAfter recording, Condon formed a full band which at times varies in the number of members, from six to ten. Live he is accompanied by Perrin Cloutier (cello/accordion), Jason Poranski (guitar/mandolin/ukulele), Nick Petree (drums), Kristin Ferebee (violin), Paul Collins (organ/keys/tambourine/ukulele), Jon Natchez (baritone sax/mandolin/glockenspiel), and Kelly Pratt (trumpet/euphonium).\r\n\r\nIn November 2006 Condon was \"briefly hospitalized for extreme exhaustion\", the band\'s website said, and as a consequence the band cancelled the rest of the tour. They resumed performing in March 2007 and released their second album, The Flying Club Cup the same year on October 9th. Parts of the album were performed and recorded by Condon in his bedroom again, but others were recorded with the live band, which resulted in a more organic, live sound. While writing, Condon said he was inspired by French music, like Jacques Brel (whose song Le Moribond he covered on his Elephant Gun EP), and he moved to Paris for a while. During the extensive tour in support of The Flying Club Cup, Condon and the band more or less fell apart from exhaustion once again and disappeared from the radar in April 2008. \r\n\r\nCondon took a long break and returned in 2009 with a double EP, March of the Zapotec & Realpeople: Holland. The first was partly recorded in Mexico with the Mexican Band Jimenez and had a more South-American flavour to it than Condon\'s previous efforts. The second EP \'Holland\' was credited to Condon\'s old name Realpeople and consisted of five electrotracks, once more in the vein of The Magnetic Fields.\r\n\r\nThe band\'s album \"The Rip Tide\" was released in 2011.\r\n\r\nAlbums\r\n    * Gulag Orkestar (May 9, 2006)\r\n    * The Flying Club Cup (October 9, 2007)\r\n    * The Rip Tide (August 2, 2011)\r\n    * No No No (September 11, 2015)\r\n    * Gallipoli (February 1, 2019)\r\n    * Artifacts (January 28, 2022)\r\n\r\n EPs\r\n    * Lon Gisland EP (January 30, 2007)\r\n    * Pompeii (February 28, 2007)\r\n    * Elephant Gun (June 25, 2007)\r\n    * March of the Zapotec & Realpeople: Holland (February 17, 2009)  \r\n    * East Harlem (June 7, 2011)  \r\n    * The Berlin-Albuquerque Sessions (November 22, 2022)\r\n\r\nOfficial website: www.beirutband.com <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Beirut\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The band name was taken from the famous children\'s author Shel Silverstein.\r\n\r\nAfter several lineup changes, the band acquired Billy Hamilton, a local fan who learned of the band\'s need for a bassist on the Internet message board \"The 905 Board\" (an Ontario area outreach board which used to be for local musicians). In Christmas of 2001, he joined the band after Shane Told helped him learn the music for the songs. Following a rehearsal on Boxing Day (December 26) in 2001, he officially debuted with Silverstein. The next spring, original guitarist Richard McWalter left the band to move to Victoria, British Columbia to study engineering. He was then replaced by Neil Boshart, childhood friend of Shane Told. The new lineup recorded a second EP, When the Shadows Beam, in preparation for their first tour in Eastern Canada.\r\n\r\nThe band then signed to Victory Records in October of 2002 with a complete lineup as Hamilton attempted to complete his secondary education one semester early. The January after, the band recorded their full-length debut CD When Broken Is Easily Fixed, released on the Victory Records label.\r\n\r\nIn August 2005 the band\'s second studio album, Discovering the Waterfront, was released through Victory Records. It was the first album to be produced by Cameron Webb, and marked the beginning of a long relationship between the band and the American producer. It also marked a shift in sound from When Broken Is Easily Fixed, with faster paced and more energetic songs, and with the band also incorporating more punk rock aspects into their music. Told\'s clean and unclean vocals had matured since their previous effort. Discovering The Waterfront opened the band up to a wider audience, with the music video for the first single \"Smile in Your Sleep\" receiving airplay on stations such as FUSE and IMF. The album sold 26,229 copies in its first week.\r\n\r\nThe band\'s third full-length album, Arrivals And Departures, was released on July 3, 2007, and was designated by AP Magazine as one of the most eagerly anticipated CDs of 2007. Mark Trombino (Jimmy Eat World, Blink-182, Finch) produced the CD. The album sold 27,000 copies in its first week. Silverstein also contributed a new acoustic version of their song \"Red Light Pledge\" to the Punk Goes Acoustic 2 compilation, released May 8, 2007 through Fearless Records.\r\n\r\nOn December 14, 2008, the band announced by Myspace bulletin that their fourth album would be released by March 31, 2009. The name of the new album, A Shipwreck in the Sand, was announced on January 29, 2009, when the band concluded a viral marketing campaign by announcing the track listing via an album website, also revealing it would be a concept album. Along with the demo of \"Broken Stars\", which the band had been performing during their final U.S. tour in support of \"Arrivals and Departures\", short clips of the songs \"Vices\", \"Born Dead\" and \"American Dream\" were made available on MySpace On March 17, the band filmed a music video for \"Vices\" with director Robby Starbuck. Later, on March 23, 2009, the band posted the full album to stream on their official MySpace page.\r\n\r\nA Shipwreck in the Sand was released on March 31, 2009 and sold nearly 17,000 copies in its first week. The iTunes version of the album includes four bonus cover songs, \"Help!\" (The Beatles cover), Go Your Own Way (Fleetwood Mac Cover), Three Miles Down (Saves The Day cover), and Total Bummer (NOFX cover).\r\n\r\nSilverstein contributed a cover version of \"Apologize\", originally recorded by OneRepublic, to the Punk Goes Pop 2 compilation album.\r\n\r\nOn October 8, 2010, online rumors spread about their new album reportedly being titled Set This All Ablaze, and that it would again be released through Silverstein\'s long time label, Victory Records. The band later rejected the rumor that the new album will be titled Set This All Ablaze, although they did confirm their departure from Victory. However, as of the first week of October 2010, Silverstein\'s official website contained a banner stating Set This All Ablaze. \r\n\r\nOn November 15, Silverstein announced on Facebook that they have signed with Hopeless Records in the USA/Europe/Japan and with Universal Music in Canada. They also said that a new EP entitled Transitions will be released December 7 and will feature two songs from their new album coming out next year as well as three additional b-sides. In response to a fan on Tumblr, Shane Told described the new music as \"a cross between Discovering the Waterfront and A Shipwreck in the Sand\". On December 3, 2010, the band posted the first single, Sacrifice, off of the new EP. On February 9, 2011, Silverstein confirmed on their Facebook and Tumblr that their new album will be called Rescue. On February 15, 2011, the band posted the album artwork for Rescue on their official Facebook page. On February 19, 2011, 89X Radio aired a new song from the band named \"Burning Hearts\". On February 22, 2011, in response to a fan on Facebook, the band stated that they were not releasing a traditional lead single from the new album, and that they had made three music videos so far. They then went on to state that the new record has \"tons of screaming and breakdowns\". The album, Rescue, was released on April 26, 2011. Silverstein has also recorded a song featuring Ryan Key of Yellowcard called \"Stay Posi\" (Stay Positive) for the Take Action! Vol 10. Compilation.\r\n\r\nOn October 17, 2011, the band posted a new video on their YouTube channel about an upcoming release. They announced that are in process of recording a new album called Short Songs with producer Jordan Valeriote, scheduled for release on February 7, 2012. They also said that the EP will contain 22 songs under 90 seconds with half songs being covers of punk songs that influenced them. Silverstein contributed a cover version of \"Runaway\", originally recorded by Kanye West, to the Punk Goes Pop 4 compilation album, released in November 21, 2011. On December 1, 2011, the band streamed two songs off Short Songs, \"SOS\" and \"Brookfield\", as well as their covers of Green Day\'s \"The Ballad of Wilhelm Fink\" and NOFX\'s \"It\'s My Job to Keep Punk Rock Elite\" on PunkNews.\r\n\r\nOn the SHORT TOUR, the band began announcing that they would have a new album in 2013. On September 25, 2012, the band announced that Neil Boshart was no longer a member of the band, after 11 years together. He was replaced by former I Am Committing A Sin guitarist Paul Marc Rousseau. Told later revealed that Boshart\'s replacement was due to many years of growing apart, stating there was very little contribution to Short Songs from Boshart.\r\n\r\nOn November 26, 2012, the band announced that their seventh studio album would be titled This Is How the Wind Shifts and would be released on February 5, 2013. A few hours later they also released the first single, titled \"Stand Amid The Roar\". On January 15, 2013 the band released the lyric video for the song \"Massachusetts\" from their seventh album.\r\n\r\nThe band\'s eighth studio album I Am Alive In Everything I Touch was released on May 19, 2015. Coinciding with the album\'s announcement, Silverstein released a music video for the track \"A Midwestern State of Emergency.\" On March 4 the band released the second single from the album, Milestone, with a lyric video to accompany the release. On March 16, 2016, Silverstein released the third music video from the album, \"The Continual Condition.\" Later, on July 27, 2016, they released a music video for \"Toronto (Unabridged)\".\r\n\r\nOn October 13, 2016, Silverstein announced the streaming \"Ghost\" on SiriusXM. Later that day, they released the music video on YouTube and the song on iTunes. Silverstein said on social media that the upcoming studio album will be released in 2017. On Thursday, May 18, 2017, Silverstein released the second single from the record, \"Retrograde\", as well as announced the track listing and title of the record, \"Dead Reflection\", which was released on July 14, 2017.

In January 2018, it was announced that Walter Gervers (bass) was leaving the band. Edwin Congreave (keyboard) announced his departure in September 2021. In May 2023, Gervers was reported as having re-joined the band.\r\n\r\nThe band was formed in 2005 by Philippakis and Bevan, both former members of math rock band The Edmund Fitzgerald, and Andrew Mears of Youthmovies. Mears left the band after their first single to focus on Youthmovies. In January 2018, it was announced that Walter Gervers was also leaving the band.\r\n\r\nIn early 2007, the band released the limited edition 7\" singles Hummer and Mathletics, both produced by Gareth Parton. In the summer of 2007 Foals began working on their debut album in New York. It was produced by Dave Sitek of TV On The Radio, however, the band decided to mix the album themselves, stating that Sitek made the first master copy of the album sound like \"it was recorded in the Grand Canyon\". Yannis has stated multiple times during various interviews that Foals and Dave Sitek are on good terms, even though the copy by Sitek was rejected by the band. \r\n\r\nFoals released their debut album, entitled Antidotes, on 24 March 2008 in the UK and 8 April 2008 in the US. The album was a commercial success in the United Kingdom, debuting at No. 3 in the UK Albums Charts. The album was a minor success in other countries, charting in Japan, France and the Netherlands. Non-UK versions of the album include the early Parton produced singles.\r\n\r\nIn August 2009, Foals started recording their second album at Svenska Grammofon Studion in Gothenburg, Sweden. The album, Total Life Forever, has been described by the band members as sounding like \"tropical prog\" and \"like the dream of an eagle dying\". The band have described the album as being \"a lot less funk\" than they had originally planned. The album was produced by Luke Smith, formerly of Clor, and its title is named after an element of Ray Kurzweil\'s theory of singularity. The band\'s frontman Yannis Philippakis has professed a long time interest in futurology, with it informing numerous songs on Total Life Forever.\r\n\r\nOn 1 March 2010, the promotional single \"Spanish Sahara\" was first played on Zane Lowe\'s show Radio 1. Foals\' new website was updated that night with the release of a video for the track directed by longtime collaborator Dave Ma. On 6 March, the Total Life Forever site was officially launched. Puzzles revealed images, lyrics and sound clips of songs from the album. The last clip appeared on 12 March, and resulted with a password entry for the Foals\' new website. The site was opened on 13 March and presented the whole new art concept and media including samples of songs, photos and videos. Lead single \"This Orient\" was released on 3 May 2010. The album was finally released on 10 May 2010. \"Spanish Sahara\" was later released as a full physical single in September 2010, featuring an edited remix starring the strings of London Contemporary Orchestra.

Jonathan Clay and Zach Chance grew up together in the small Texas town of Magnolia. From a young age, they shared a love for music as well as the outdoors. About an hour north of Magnolia, Texas, there was some old family land with a dilapidated ranch house where they spent the better part of their adolescence.\r\n\r\nAt one point or another, music from Creedence Clearwater Revival and The Everly Brothers, to fellow Texans Willie Nelson, Guy Clark and Stevie Ray Vaughan found it’s way through an old pair of speakers that sat on the back porch. The pair spent the day exploring that thousand-acre plot of land, and when the sun went down they took to the records of the songwriters and bands that inspired them. At the age of 22, they moved to Austin and began to craft a sound of their own. Deeply rooted in harmony, they merged the sounds of the South with classic American and Western rock.\r\n\r\nLooking for adventure, as well as a change of pace, they eventually made the decision to head west and make the move to Los Angeles, CA.\r\n \r\nThroughout the course of the next 12 months, they wrote what is Jamestown Revival’s first full-length album, UTAH. It’s heavily autobiographical, telling the stories of their adventures, their discomforts, and their observations. In order to capture the spirit of the music, the two found a log cabin high within the Wasatch Mountains of Utah. The pair, along with their band and engineer, set out to convert it in to a temporary recording studio. With wild moose right outside the window, and aspen leaves spinning in the wind, they tracked the 11 songs that make up UTAH. Performed live, with no headphones, and entirely to tape, the process captured the moments in the room.\r\n\r\nJonathan Clay and Zach Chance have since moved back to Austin and signed a record deal with Republic Records. Adding to the already soulful album, the band has since re-released UTAH to feature three brand new arrangements of the signature tracks. Through constant touring, the songs took on a life of their own, and these arrangements better reflect the songs as they are today. Teaming up with Republic gave Jonathan and Zach the chance to add to the album without sacrificing what was special about the original UTAH. It was a chance to go back and record the growth that has occurred over the past year, and add to an already strong collection of recordings.\r\n\r\nHeading out on the road somewhere… exploring far more than just that thousand-acre plot of land Jonathan and Zach look towards the future with UTAH. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Jamestown+Revival\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The band\'s lyrics are written and sung by Matt Berninger in a distinctive, deep baritone. The rest of the band is composed of two pairs of brothers: Aaron Dessner (guitar, bass, keyboards), Bryce Dessner (guitar), Scott Devendorf (bass, guitar) and Bryan Devendorf (drums). \r\n\r\nTheir self-titled debut album\"The National\" (Brassland 2001) was recorded and released before they had played even a single show. They cut the album with engineer Nick Lloyd and formed a label with writer Alec Bemis, so those recordings could be released. Kerrang! magazine gave it four Ks, calling it \"the stuff underground legends are made of.\"\r\n\r\nThe National made a second album, \"Sad Songs for Dirty Lovers\" (Brassland/Talitres 2003). The staff was the same, though Peter Katis, who produced \"Turn on The Bright Lights\" and \"Antics\" by Interpol, helped produce and mix, and Australian composer Padma Newsome from Clogs collaborated on arrangements and strings.\r\n\r\nFollowing the first session of several for Bernard Lenoir on France\'s Radio Inter, an in-between EP was released, Cherry Tree, containing what would become the blueprint for the sound on their next record and the session of Sad Song\'s standout Murder Me Rachael. After these accolades and being impressed by their live show, Roger Trust signed them to Beggars Banquet.\r\n\r\nA show at their favorite bar became a van ride to neighboring cities, became a plane ride to Europe, became two summers overseas. Their ties to those good jobs slackened. And they continue on their own path, moving out even further out in Brooklyn to Ditmas Park, where there is space and familiar suburban streets and even Geese on Beverly Road. Their album, \"Alligator\", much of which was recorded at their homes in Ditmas Park, was engineered by Paul Mahajan, who has worked with the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and TV on the Radio. Padma Newsome camped out for a month with the band, and Peter Katis added more production and mixed the record at his house in Bridgeport, Connecticut.\r\n\r\nBerninger\'s potent baritone still intones about matters fraught and funny and sad; about record collections, missing persons and medium-sized American hearts. But the record\'s not simply gothic or miserablist -- more like the plays of Tennessee Williams, it\'s full of peculiar intimacies and awkward grace. Alligator\'s heroes are reckless and possessed seducers, but they are apologetic ones. In The National\'s imaginings, in songs alternately lush and spare, there is something twighlit and dreamy worked out in the basement of our brains.\r\n\r\n\"Abel,\" \"Secret Meeting,\" and \"Lit Up\" were released as singles.\r\n\r\nOn May 22, 2007, The National released their follow-up to Alligator, Boxer, on Beggars Banquet. Taking advantage of the fact that nobody had heard their first album and earliest demos, Matt proceeded to steal lyrics and melodies from them and give them the attention they deserved while keeping the intimacy that made them special. They even managed to convince new friend Sufjan Stevens to lay down some piano tracks for them, and recorded the album in a scant 6 months after coming off the long post-Alligator road.\r\n\r\n\"Mistaken for Strangers\", \"Fake Empire\" and \"Apartment Story\" have been released as singles. The band have just finished touring North America and are on a large European autumn/winter tour after playing high slots at several large festivals. In their Dec. 07/Jan. 08 issue, Paste magazine named Boxer best record of 2007.\r\n\r\nThe band\'s fifth album, High Violet, was released on May 10, 2010 by 4AD Records. \"Bloodbuzz Ohio\", \"Anyone\'s Ghost\" and \"Terrible Love\" were released as singles.\r\n\r\nIn 2013 their sixth studio record Trouble Will Find Me was released and named \"Best New Music\" by Pitchfork.

The classically-trained Parisian recruited Tame Impala frontman Kevin Parker to produce the self-titled debut album in 2012. The independently-produced album Bon Voyage was released in 2018.\r\n\r\nOn the debut album, lead single/opener “I Follow You” begins with simple, sun-drenched ’60s melodies and ambling guitars before descending into a psychedelic swirl that recalls Parker’s day job. Consider that spiral a gentle warning to not expect anything straightforward from Melody’s Echo Chamber, especially when things seem to be heading in that direction. On “Endless Shore”, for example, Prochet crafts a densely layered haze complete with ethereal coos signature to the style, yet she does so in a manner that’s less pensive and more authoritative. The rhythm section doesn’t bother with hypnosis, favoring a superliminal approach, a feat developed well into the motorik beats of “Crystallized”. The unabashed prettiness of Prochet’s vocals on “You Won’t Be Missing That Part Of Me” are undercut by sci-fi tinged synth notes that propel the song into the unknown cosmos. “Snowcapped Andes Crash” finds the band swapping their pop leanings for a jazzy feel. The track’s midsection crashes back to earth, only to continue as if the avalanches of the title never happened. Fuzzed guitars take a backseat to Air-like grooves on “Mount Hopeless”, chiming in and out like some kind of warning. This lounge-y vibe is immediately shattered on the glitched-out two minute distortion-fest “Is That What You Said”.

Nicknamed \"the Boss\", he has released 21 studio albums during a career spanning six decades, most of which feature his backing band, the E Street Band. Springsteen is a pioneer of heartland rock, a genre combining mainstream rock music with poetic and socially conscious lyrics that feature narratives primarily concerning working class American life. He is known for his descriptive lyrics and energetic concerts, which sometimes last over four hours.\r\n\r\nSpringsteen released his first two albums, Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J. and The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle, in 1973. Although both were well-received by critics, neither earned him a large audience. He then changed his style and achieved worldwide popularity with Born to Run (1975). This was followed by Darkness on the Edge of Town (1978) and The River (1980), Springsteen\'s first album to top the Billboard 200 chart. After the solo effort Nebraska (1982), he recorded Born in the U.S.A. (1984) with the E Street Band, which became his most commercially successful album and the 23rd-best selling album of all time as of 2024. All seven singles from Born in the U.S.A. reached the Top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100, including the title track. Springsteen mostly hired session musicians for the recording of his next three albums, Tunnel of Love (1987), Human Touch (1992), and Lucky Town (1992). He reassembled the E Street Band for Greatest Hits (1995), then solo recorded the acoustic album The Ghost of Tom Joad (1995), and the EP Blood Brothers (1996).\r\n\r\nSpringsteen dedicated The Rising (2002) to the victims of the September 11 attacks. He released two more folk albums, Devils & Dust (2005) and We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions (2006), followed by two more albums with the E Street Band, Magic (2007) and Working on a Dream (2009). The next two albums, Wrecking Ball (2012) and High Hopes (2014), topped album charts worldwide. From 2017 to 2018, and again in 2021, Springsteen performed a critically acclaimed show Springsteen on Broadway, in which he performed some of his songs and told stories from his 2016 autobiography; an album version from the Broadway performances was released in 2018. He then released the solo Western Stars (2019), Letter to You (2020) with the E Street Band, and a solo covers album Only the Strong Survive (2022). Letter to You reached No. 2 in the U.S., making Springsteen the first artist to release a Top 5 album across six consecutive decades.\r\n\r\nOne of the album era\'s most prominent musicians, Springsteen has sold more than 71 million albums in the U.S. and over 140 million worldwide, making him the 27th best-selling music artist of all time as of 2024. He is the recipient of numerous accolades, including 20 Grammy Awards, two Golden Globes, an Academy Award, and a Special Tony Award. He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1999, received the Kennedy Center Honors in 2009, was named MusiCares person of the year in 2013, and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016 and the National Medal of Arts in 2023. In 2010, Rolling Stone ranked him 23rd on its list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\", which described him as being \"the embodiment of rock & roll\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bruce+Springsteen\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Their first album, 1980\'s On Through the Night, reached the Top 15 in the UK but received little notice elsewhere. Their second album, 1981\'s High \'n\' Dry, was produced by Mutt Lange, who helped them begin to define their melodic hard rock style, and the album\'s most popular track \"Bringin\' On the Heartbreak\" became one of the first rock videos played on MTV in 1982, but the album only reached the Top 30 and 40 in the UK and US.

The third single, \"Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad\", was a Top 15 song in the US, UK and Canada. Adrenalize went on to sell over 8 million copies worldwide.

Formed in 2015, the duo comprises Dylan Brady and Laura Les, who also performs as osno1. \r\n\r\nBrady and Les, who lived in Kirkwood and Webster Groves respectively, initially crossed paths during high school at a rodeo. However, it was not until they reconnected at a house party in 2012 that they contemplated collaborating. Winter of 2015 marked their first foray into joint music production, with recording sessions taking place in Chicago. Eventually, they self-released their debut EP, titled \"100 gecs,\" on July 12, 2016. The origins behind their chosen moniker, \"100 gecs,\" remain a matter of dispute, as varying and contradictory explanations have been provided by Brady and Les in interviews.\r\n\r\nDespite initial plans to create more music together, time constraints hindered their progress until their collaboration for the 2019 Minecraft Fire Festival. Subsequently, they resumed working on songs by sending Logic files over email back and forth. They released their debut single, \"Money Machine,\" on May 29, 2019. Shortly after, their first full-length album, \"1000 gecs,\" was released on May 31, 2019, receiving favorable reviews. The album itself is described as a 23-minute sonic experience featuring a diverse range of musical influences, blending elements of ringtone rap, pop punk, trance pop, abstract sound structures, power ballads, rap, EDM, dubstep, death metal, and ska. The lyrics of the songs reflect the intricacies and anxieties of the digital age, with autotune-drenched vocals adding emotion and a sense of delirium.\r\n\r\nIn August 2019, Dylan Brady released the stems for \"1000 gecs,\" inspiring fans and friends of 100 gecs to create numerous remixes. Reviewing the remixes, Brady and Les embarked on compiling a remix album.\r\n\r\nIn September 2019, it was announced that 100 gecs, alongside Slowthai, would support Brockhampton on their Heaven Belongs to You Tour later that year. Additionally, 100 gecs headlined six of their shows in various cities during the tour.\r\n\r\nRolling Stone recognized 100 gecs as an \"Artist You Need to Know\" in 2019. Music critic Jon Caramanica of The New York Times hailed \"1000 gecs\" as the best album of 2019, with various other publications, including Crack Magazine, Noisey, Paper, Pitchfork, and Stereogum, also ranking it among the best albums of the year.\r\n\r\nOn July 10, 2020, the duo released the remix compilation album \"1000 gecs and The Tree of Clues.\" (initially titled \"1000 gecs & th3 phant0m m3nace\"). It features guest appearances by artists such as Injury Reserve, A. G. Cook, and Black Dresses.\r\n\r\nIn 2020, 100 gecs signed with Atlantic Records. Brady told NME they are trying to be as big as Ed Sheeran, while Les said Atlantic was a good fit for what they wanted to accomplish.\r\n\r\nThe duo headlined the Minecraft festival Square Garden in April 2020, sharing the virtual stage with notable artists such as Charli XCX, Kero Kero Bonito, Dorian Electra, and Cashmere Cat.\r\n\r\nOn November 15, 2020, they released the standalone single \"Lonely Machines\" with the American band 3OH!3. They followed this up with the Christmas song \"Sympathy 4 the Grinch.\"\r\n\r\nIn early 2021, 100 gecs released a remix of Linkin Park\'s \"One Step Closer\" to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Linkin Park\'s debut studio album, \"Hybrid Theory.\" Following this release, the duo embarked on individual projects.\r\n\r\nIn July 2021, they announced the 10000 gecs Tour, scheduled to take place from October to December in North America.

In times of emotional distress, he write songs. In times of invigorating happiness, he write songs. There has become an incredible comfort found in molding a blank canvas into a piece of art that he find to be extraordinarily beautiful. \r\n\r\nPrior to Missio, he found himself writing songs in the name of fame, lured by the sweet distaste of vanity. He found very little enjoyment in this endeavor.

He lost purpose and became blinded by the opinions of people he would never meet.\r\n\r\nIn August of 2013 he made the conscious decision to move into a 1974 airstream trailer, quieting my mind and focusing on my craft. He became inspired to create songs again, giving little thought to strangers opinions. Fifty two songs later he is ready to release a few of them.

The band consists of Brian Aubert (vocals, guitar), Nikki Monninger (bass, vocals), Joe Lester (keyboards) and Christopher Guanlao (drums).  The band members are friends who had played together previously or in mutual friends\' bands. \r\n\r\nThe name Silversun Pickups refers to a liquor store across the road L.A. rock-scene hang Silverlake Lounge. One of the band’s friends would often arrive at the store late at night to buy liquor, and would be as such making the \"Silversun Pickup\". \r\n\r\nThe band is signed to Dangerbird Records. They released their debut EP \"Pikul\" in July of 2005. The band has released four albums,  2006\'s \"Carnavas\", 2009\'s \"Swoon\", 2012\'s \"Neck of the Woods\" and 2015\'s \"Better Nature\". The band managed two Top 10 singles on Billboard\'s Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart in 2007: \"Lazy Eye\" (#5) and \"Well Thought Out Twinkles\" (#9). In 2009, they managed their third top 10 on the chart, \"Panic Switch\" (#1)  and a fourth song \"Substitution\" was also on that chart (#23).\r\n\r\nSilversun Pickups have been compared to The Smashing Pumpkins (possibly due in part to Brian Aubert\'s vocal style) and 90\'s shoegazing bands like My Bloody Valentine, Lush, Ride, and Slowdive. Silversun Pickups claim they have been heavily influenced by Modest Mouse and The Velvet Underground as well as other lesser-known acts.\r\n\r\nTheir first break came when a friend mailed a boombox demo to CMJ and they were accepted. They got their start in many of the most important L.A. clubs and began to draw a strong following upon the release of the Pikul EP. This culminated in frequent touring, including a co-headlining stint with Viva Voce.\r\n\r\nThe band finished a three-week tour opening for Australian rockers Wolfmother on December 9, 2006, and have toured with OK Go and Snow Patrol on their U.S. spring tour, which ended on April 10, 2007. The Pickups played at the Coachella Music Festival in Indio, California on April 27, 2007.\r\n\r\nThe band supported Foo Fighters, along with Nine Inch Nails on August 21st 2007 as part of the \'T on the Fringe\' music festival in Edinburgh, Scotland, and then on the 22nd in Marley Park, Dublin, Ireland. They also performed at the Carling Reading and Leeds festivals on the 25th/26th August 2007 and supported Kaiser Chiefs on their Autumn European tour and Snow Patrol on their tour of Australia (with Paolo from Snow Patrol joining them regularly to play guitar on Lazy Eye and Nikki guesting on vocals for Snow Patrol\'s Set The Fire To The Third Bar onstage). On some of these dates the band have been covering Joy Division\'s Shadowplay and Bjork\'s Big Time Sensuality, both of which have been recorded for web or radio sessions.\r\n\r\nThe second full studio album, entitled \"Swoon\", was released 14th April 2009 in both the US and UK.\r\n\r\nThe band was also part of Lollapalooza 2009 in Chicago, IL, Voodoo Fest 2009 and 2012  in New Orleans, and the 2009 Sasquatch!

The band consists of lead vocalist David Frey, rhythm guitarist Ben McDonald, lead guitarist Shaun Tomczak, bass guitarist Cal Joslin and drummer Justin Nace. They initially made a name for themselves at Indiana’s Anderson University where Frey and McDonald met. After signing with Word Records, Sidewalk Prophets released their debut studio album These Simple Truths on August 25, 2009, which earned the group the 2010 GMA Dove Award for New Artist of the Year. In July 2011 the third single released from the set, You Love Me Anyway, became their first #1 on the Billboard Christian singles chart.  They released their second major album,  Live Like That on March 2012.\r\n\r\nBiography\r\n\r\nThe Sidewalk Prophets are an unlikely group of poets, musicians, and fun-lovers who have been brought together by the blood of Jesus Christ to share the hope, faith, tragedy, and love that is the reality of Christianity. For over 5 years the Sidewalk Prophets have been traveling across the United States and overseas sharing the redeeming love of Jesus Christ.  They are armed with a dynamic songwriting duo comprised of college dorm mates turned best friends David Frey and Ben McDonald.  Frey is equipped with an unrivaled vocal range and a distinct soulful voice that is full of engaging passion.  McDonald brings an undeniable drive and passion for writing songs that will engage both churched and unchurched listeners. \r\n\r\nThe band has been hitting the road hard for the past 3 years playing 125+ shows a year worldwide.  They’ve been making thousands of friends and fans in the process.  Along the way the band has achieved some longtime goals of playing with bands they looked up to as teenagers.  The band has had the honor of sharing the stage with acts like Jeremy Camp, Audio Adrenaline, Stellar Kart, Building 429, and Ginny Owens as well as many others. \r\n\r\nThe Sidewalk Prophets main focus is to make young people feel comfortable being who God has created them to be.  Young people today more than ever have the task of living in a world that places so much value on fitting in and achieving the perfect image.  The band travels with the slogan “Image is nothing…love is everything.”  Dave from the Sidewalk Prophets explains the bands vision like this, “We have traveled all over the United States working with young people and there is one resounding problem that we run into.  The problem is that our young people are being pressured to live up to the world’s standard of success.  The world is selling the idea that image is everything but we know that the only way this can be true is by helping God’s children young and old realize that an image molded after Christ is the only image worth striving for.” \r\n\r\nThe Sidewalk Prophets have had appeal not only to young people but to their parents and grandparents as well.  Their musical pallet includes an eclectic group of influences from past to present which allows the band to connect with almost anyone who listens.  Their sound is a melting pot which culminates into an original blend of acoustic rock music.  Their shows bring the depth of a singer/songwriter and the energy of a rock & roll band.    In June of 2007 the band packed up their bags and headed south to Nashville, TN in hopes of expanding their platform to do ministry.\r\n\r\nAfter releasing a full-length album and EP independently, they made their major-label debut with \"These Simple Truths\" in August 2009.\r\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Sidewalk+Prophets\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The past few years have been an incredible journey that Chapman wouldn’t have chosen, yet has taught him so very much. Those lessons permeate every song on Chapman’s new album The Glorious Unfolding.\r\n\r\nLyrically the album is teeming with the substantive lyrics that have made Chapman the most awarded artist in Christian music with 57 Gospel Music Association Dove Awards, five GRAMMYs, 47 No. 1 singles and approaching 11 million albums sold. Musically there’s a sense of adventure that reflects Chapman’s ongoing willingness to experiment and leap out of his comfort zone. He’s never taken the gift of music for granted and approaches each new project both excited and humbled by the possibilities.\r\n\r\n“I’m very, very grateful to be given the opportunity to make music and share the things that I feel like God has entrusted to me,” Chapman says. “I don’t take it lightly. I pray: ‘God, I want to know You and I want to make You known.’ God has continued faithfully to reveal Himself through dark places and reveal His mysteriousness. I get the sense that He’s telling an amazing story. He’s not confused. He’s not biting his nails worrying if the plan is going to turn out okay the way I do. He’s fully confident of His plans and He’s in control. That’s been something that I’ve held onto.”\r\n\r\nThe Glorious Unfolding is Chapman’s 18th album and his first studio album of all-original material in seven years. However, now, more than ever he felt it was time to express these steadfast messages of faithfulness, while successfully blending his trademark sound with musical creativity. “Musically, I really wanted to find those ways to make something that felt very honest and true, and yet very fresh and relevant,” Chapman says. “I felt like this had to be a little bit more exciting and energetic and I was ready to crank it up. It felt like this is the time to do that and celebrate. With this music, you will hopefully hear that and get a sense of the excitement and joy in this record.”\r\n\r\nThe album’s lead single, “Love Take Me Over,” is an exuberant anthem with an infectious melody that inspires listeners and gives the instant urge to hit repeat. “Even though it’s in the guise of a very fun, up-tempo sing-along-at-the-top-of-your-lungs song, it’s a message and a lesson that I have continued to be in the process of learning,” Chapman says of the song. “I need to be filled with love so that I can be loving in the way I respond. I’m still learning that the only way I want to love others well in my life is when I come to terms daily, sometimes hourly, sometimes in 15 minute increments, with the fact that I am loved fully and completely, not as I should be, but as I am. That drives me, then, to a place of living a life of love for others when I realize that I am loved first. We love because He first loved us.”\r\n\r\nOne of the many highlights from the album is “Together,” a beautiful song that Chapman wrote for his wife Mary Beth. “In October, we celebrate our 29th anniversary,” he says, acknowledging that the past five years, since their youngest daughter (Maria Sue) was killed in a tragic accident, have been especially trying. “Statistics show that 90% of marriages don’t survive the loss of a child. The fact that we are together celebrating 29 years of marriage is a testimony to God’s faithfulness and God’s grace.”\r\n\r\nChapman delayed playing this song for Mary Beth until it was completely finished, recorded and mixed. “I sat her down and played this for her as we held hands and wept together through this celebration of God’s faithfulness,” he adds, “I’m really hopeful that this song will encourage and minister to people in a deep way.”\r\n\r\nThe Glorious Unfolding also includes a special song, “Only One and Only You,” written to encourage his daughter Shaohannah. “She’s 13, which tells you a lot of what you need to know about her,” he says with a grin. “It’s that wonderful, incredibly awful time to try to be a young lady in this world and culture. I’m just very, very proud of her and I wanted to just write a song to tell her how amazing she is.”\r\n\r\nOther standout tracks include “Something Beautiful,” an up-tempo, forward-thinking song about the unfolding and promises of God, and watching Him turn broken things in life into something good as He’s promised. “Take Another Step,” is another high-energy declaration that talks of taking those steps of faith in times of uncertainty, when the road ahead is completely dark, whether it be good or bad, and fully trusting what God has in store.\r\n\r\nWhether encouraging those he’s closest to in this world to see themselves as God sees them or inviting an arena full of fans to sing along in celebration of God’s faithfulness, Chapman has spent his life creating music that makes a difference. The Glorious Unfolding continues that impressive legacy. In listening to the project, it feels like a landmark album, being musically inventive, yet bursting with truth, integrity and emotional gravitas in much the same way as The Great Adventure did when that ground-breaking album released in 1992.\r\n\r\nThe latest album installment is his second record since signing with Provident Music Group in 2012. His label debut, JOY, served up holiday classics alongside his engaging original tunes. It became the latest entry in the Paducah, Kentucky native’s beloved Christmas catalog and provided Chapman and co-producer Brent Milligan a chance to explore different sounds in the studio. On The Glorious Unfolding, Chapman and Milligan reveled in the chance to experiment further to provide a fresh framework for these new songs, utilizing different textures and techniques to expand on Chapman’s signature sound.\r\n\r\nRecorded at Chapman’s home studio, he enlisted son Will Franklin to play drums on six tracks on the album and also engaged other musical pals such as Delirious? alum Stu G on guitar and acclaimed fiddler Andy Leftwich, a member of Ricky Skaggs’ band, Kentucky Thunder, and a key creative force in the making of Chapman\'s Cracker Barrel release, Deep Roots. On “Sound of Your Voice,” Chapman recruited surprise guests, wife Mary Beth, daughters Emily and Stevey Joy and daughters-in-law Julia Chapman and Jillian Edwards Chapman to sing background vocals.\r\n\r\nRecording The Glorious Unfolding was a labor of love for Chapman, helping him give voice to his own joys and challenges and he’s hopeful it will do the same for others. “The theme was this idea that God will complete the story and in fact, He already has completed it and knows the ending,” Chapman says. “Yet a part of the mystery is that He is revealing it in our lives and it’s this unfolding, incredible tale of His love for us. This album gave me a chance to tell that, to celebrate loss and hope and new life. For all of that, I’m really grateful. It really is my hope that people will hear the sound of God’s voice whispering to them: ‘I know the plans I have for you. Will you trust me? Will you trust me through the hard seasons and through the good seasons? The story is good. Will you trust me and watch it unfold?’”\r\n\r\nBeginning in September 2014 until April 2015, Chapman revitalized the well-known concert series \"Sam\'s Place: Music for the Spirit\" concert series. The series was once a month and was held at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville with featured performances by the likes of MercyMe, Amy Grant, Michael W. Smith and Third Day. \r\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Steven+Curtis+Chapman\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Despite going through many lineup changes, the current lineup is identical to the original, with the exception of Wretzky, who would end up leaving the band just before their initial breakup in 2000.\r\n\r\nDisavowing the punk rock roots of many of their alt-rock contemporaries, they have a diverse, densely layered, and guitar-heavy sound, containing elements of gothic rock, heavy metal, dream pop, psychedelic rock, progressive rock, shoegazing, and, in later recordings, electronica. Corgan is the group\'s primary songwriter; his musical ambitions and cathartic lyrics have shaped the band\'s albums and songs, which have been described as \"anguished, bruised reports from Billy Corgan\'s nightmare-land\".\r\n\r\nThe Smashing Pumpkins broke into the musical mainstream with their second album, 1993\'s Siamese Dream. The group built its audience with extensive touring and their 1995 follow-up, the double album Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 album chart. 1998\'s Adore would just barely miss out, peaking at number two. With 30 million albums sold worldwide, the Smashing Pumpkins were one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands of the 1990s. However, internal fighting, drug use, and diminishing record sales led to a 2000 break-up.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Corgan and Chamberlin reconvened to record a new Smashing Pumpkins album, Zeitgeist. After touring throughout 2007 and 2008 with a lineup including new guitarist Jeff Schroeder, Chamberlin left the band in early 2009. Later that year, Corgan began a new recording series with a rotating lineup of musicians entitled Teargarden by Kaleidyscope, which encompassed the release of stand-alone singles, compilation EP releases, and two full albums that also fell under the project\'s scope—Oceania in 2012 and Monuments to an Elegy in 2014.

The group chose the name \"Bush\" because they used to live in Shepherd\'s Bush, London.\r\n\r\nTheir first album, Sixteen Stone (1994), was a huge commercial success. Almost overnight, Bush went from playing small pubs in London to headlining arenas in the US, the result of extensive promotion on MTV and non-stop touring. Critics labeled them as an inferior derivative of bands such as Nirvana and Pixies, and this criticism followed them throughout their career as a band. In particular, Rossdale\'s throaty singing voice and random, stream of consciousness-style lyrics were dismissed by some as an imitation of Nirvana\'s lead singer, Kurt Cobain. Although the band reached superstar status in the U.S., they failed to have much impact on the Britpop riddled UK charts, the lone exception being their single Swallowed, which reached #7. A change in record labels, management and an extended hiatus did not bode well for the band, who unofficially split in 2002.\r\n\r\nFrustrated by the disappointing sales of Golden State (their fifth album, in 2001) and lack of support the band was receiving from Atlantic, the band decided to go on a hiatus. Band members went to work on various other musical projects notably Gavin Rossdale, and his new band Institute.\r\n\r\nOn June 21, 2010 it was announced that Bush were reuniting. There will be a new album called \"The Sea of Memories\" (previously named as \"Everything Always Now\"). Two original members, Rossdale and Goodridge, are joined by Chris Traynor and Corey Britz.  The release will be their first indie release since Sixteen Stone, released on Rossdale\'s own Zuma Rock Records. \r\n\r\nBush\'s albums include Razorblade Suitcase (produced by Steve Albini), Deconstructed, The Science of Things, and Golden State.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Bush released The Best of \'94 - \'99, a greatest hits compilation, and Zen X Four, a CD and DVD which features the band\'s music videos. Zen X Four was released on Kirtland Records and has its own website.\r\n\r\nBush will release their fifth studio album, The Sea Of Memories, on September 13, 2011. It is the band\'s first studio set in ten years, the first Bush album released on E1 Records and their first venture away from Interscope, who handled all of their previous releases. (Sound Of Winter Songfacts).\r\n\r\nBush\'s members have included Gavin Rossdale, Dave Parsons, Robin Goodridge, Sacha Putnam,  Nigel Pulsford, and Chris Traynor who played lead guitar during the Golden State tour.\r\n\r\nThe track The People That We Love was featured in the game Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit 2.\r\n\r\nIn Canada, Rossdale\'s band was once known as Bush^X, because the 1970s band Bush, led by Domenic Troiano, owned the Canadian rights to the name. In April 1997, it was announced that Troiano had agreed to let them use the name Bush in Canada without the exponent X, in exchange for donating $20,000 each to the Starlight Foundation and the Canadian Music Therapy Trust Fund.\r\n\r\n2. Bush was a 70s Canadian Rock band signed to RCA in Canada and Dunhill Records in the USA. The members were previously in Mandala and toured with Three Dog Night and Steppenwolf. The Canadian Bush forced the British Bush were forced to release their albums in Canada as Bush X.\r\n\r\nBush was a Canadian rock band in the early 1970s, which evolved from the respected club act Mandala.\r\n\r\nMandala had a minor Canadian hit with the song \"Love-Itis\". Bush consisted of ex-Mandala bandmates Domenic Troiano, Roy Kenner, Hugh Sullivan and Pentti Glan, plus Prakash John. The group released a single eponymous album in 1970. The band recorded on the RCA label in Canada and Dunhill in the US, and toured with label mates Steppenwolf and Three Dog Night. Three Dog Night released one of their songs, \"I Can Hear You Calling\" as the B-side of their successful single \"Joy to the World\". The song, co-written by Troiano, Kenner, Glan and Sullivan, also appeared on Three Dog Night\'s Naturally album. Bush was short-lived as a band, but had some influence among musicians for their jazz-influenced rock.\r\n\r\nBush became newsworthy again in 1995, as the result of an intellectual property dispute with the British alternative band Bush. As Troiano still owned the rights to that name, the British band were forced to release their albums in Canada as \"Bushx\". In late April 1997, Troiano and Gavin Rossdale reached an agreement under which Rossdale\'s band was permitted to use the name Bush without the letter X, in exchange for donating $20,000 each to the Starlight Foundation and the Canadian Music Therapy Trust Fund.\r\n\r\nAll of the band members continued in music after the breakup of Bush. Kenner and Troiano joined The James Gang, following the departure of Joe Walsh. They performed together on the albums Passin\' Thru and Straight Shooter, after which Troiano left to join The Guess Who. Kenner stayed with The James Gang, then with lead guitarist Tommy Bolin, for two further albums, Bang and Miami. John and Glan became session musicians, who also toured with Alice Cooper and Lou Reed. Troiano later developed a successful solo career, which also included Kenner at various times. John later fronted a Toronto-based rhythm and blues band, The Lincolns, which continues to play today. In 2005, Domenic Troiano died at the age of 59, from prostate cancer.\r\nPentti Glan a.k.a.

At the same time, he started playing the guitar that his grandfather had left for him years before, and soon learned to play songs from artists such as Bob Marley and Sublime.\r\n\r\nBased on his own confession, Caloncho was the name his grandfather and step-sister, Angélica, used to call him when he was very little and since the name never annoyed him, he decided to use it as his musical stage name.\r\n\r\nHis first EP \"Homeotermo\" was recorded in 2011, and soon after, he started working with músician Siddhartha (a former-teacher and friend). He asked him to be his producer and Siddhartha agreed, saying about him: \"Caloncho is a newly born musician, he is being newly discovered, both by himself and by those around him. He sent me a sample of his music and I immediately felt it was a musical obligation to help extract the sweet juice from his fruitful melodies.\" (Caloncho\'s website).\r\n\r\nCaloncho then released his second EP, titled \"Fruta\" (Fruit), in September 2013. This production mixes his unique musical style with rhythms and stories of Mexican national folk, beaches, and forest rhythms, as well as urban sounds. All these sounds are used to retell different situations from his own life.\r\n\r\n\"We experimented a lot during the creation of the EP. We used organic sounds and objects that are not considered musical instruments, such as water, fruit, seeds, lighters, etc. I love it and I want to hear it\", he said.\r\n\r\nCalancho has admitted that thanks to music, he has been able to live his life through all his senses. Music has also allowed him to feel completely connected with his family. \"My dad would write and play songs for us, and he would invite us to build on them, as a way to be in communion with each other,\" he\'s said.\r\n\r\nIn 2015 he published the LP, \"Fruta Vol. II\" (Fruit Vol. II), a production worked with certain arrangements.\r\n\r\nHe was nominated for the Latin Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Caloncho\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

These girls and their group are managed by the Amuse talent agency.\r\n\r\nBefore Momoko Okazaki was announced as a member for BABYMETAL, Yui Mizuno 水野由結 (aka Yuimetal) was in BABYMETAL, before it was announced that she had left the group due to health issues.\r\n\r\nThey first appeared on the debut Sakura Gakuin album, さくら学院 2010年度 〜message〜 performing ド・キ・ド・キ☆モーニング.\r\n\r\nBabymetal\'s first indie CD single, BABYMETAL × キバオブアキバ, released jointly with キバオブアキバ, ranked 3rd in the Oricon weekly indie chart and number one in the Tower Records Shibuya weekly indie ranking. The band\'s major debut single, \"Ijime, Dame, Zettai\" (イジメ、ダメ、ゼッタイ), sold 19,000 copies in its first week and debuted at number 6 in the Oricon weekly singles chart.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 2013, Suzuka Nakamoto graduated from junior high school and therefore had to \"graduate\" from the group Sakura Gakuin (that consists of girls of up to junior high). However, their management decided that Babymetal would not dissolve and would continue their activities as a band. The group released its next single, titled \"Megitsune\" (メギツネ) on June 19.\r\n\r\nBabymetal attended SUMMER SONIC 2013 which was held in Tokyo and Osaka on August 10 and 11, 2013. It was their second time performing at the festival; in 2012, they became the youngest artists ever (with the average age of 12) to perform there. Later, in October 2013, Babymetal became also the youngest artists ever to perform at the LOUD PARK heavy metal music festival. In November 2013, Babymetal released a promo video for the Japanese premiere of Metallica\'s movie, Through the Never.\r\n\r\nThe group announced a two-day live concert at Budokan, scheduled for March 1 and 2, 2014, and a debut album, released February 26, 2014. The album contains 13 tracks and is also available in a limited edition version containing a bonus DVD with music videos and live footage.\r\n\r\nBabymetal made their debut appearance in the United Kingdom at the Sonisphere Festival 2014, performing their set in the Bohemia tent on July 6, 2014.\r\n\r\nIn 2016, the group released Road of Resistance featuring Dragonforce Herman Li and Sam Totman as a guitar playing. This song was featured in their second album Metal Resistence which was released the same year.\r\n\r\nIn 2017, Babymetal supported multiple bands during their tours: Metallica, Guns \'N Roses (as the opening act), the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Korn.

He has also come to like interpreting it as \"newborn metal.\" In an interview for RazorTV while in Singapore in late 2013, the band members also used the latter interpretation.

Critic Eduardo Rivadavia describes them as \"perhaps the ultimate stoner rock band\" and notes they exerted a strong influence on heavy metal in the 1990s. However, conflict with its record company contributed to Sleep\'s breakup by the end of the decade. The band reformed in 2009 and has played sporadic live dates internationally since. In 2018, Sleep released their fourth and comeback album, The Sciences, to critical acclaim.\r\n\r\nSleep evolved in the early 1990s from the band Asbestosdeath, which was established by vocalist/bassist Al Cisneros, drummer Chris Hakius, and guitarist Tom Choi. Asbestosdeath expanded to a quartet with the introduction of Matt Pike on guitar, and recorded two singles - \"Dejection\" for Profane Existence and the self-released \"Unclean\". Choi departed, and would later found Operator Generator, It Is I, Noothgrush, and Las Vegas\' Black Jetts. Asbestosdeath recruited Justin Marler as replacement and the band adopted the new name, Sleep.\r\n\r\nSleep has used cannabis-influenced imagery since the release of their second album. In an interview about the making of Jerusalem, Matt Pike acknowledged that the band spent \"a lot\" of their label advance on cannabis, and \"a lot of time.\" Pike also said that about $75,000 was spent on customized amplifiers so the album would have numerous tone layers.\r\n\r\n2) Sleep is an experimental avant-garde group from New Zealand. Members are: Kim Pieters (Dadamah, Flies Inside The Sun, Rain), Peter Stapleton (Dadamah, The Pin Group, The Terminals, Flies Inside The Sun), and Susan Ballard. Also sometimes Nathan Thompson (Sandoz Lab Technicians) included. They released two albums; Enfolded In Luxury (1999) and Ghostwriting (2001), both on Metonymic label. Their music can be categorized as \"free noise\" or \"free improvisation\" as well.\r\n\r\n3) Sleep is a melodic hardcore punk band from Brighton, UK. They were only active from 89-91. They release a 7\"  in 1990 and an LP entitled \"Cat And Mouse\" in 1991. Both were released on Meantime Records. They featured two members of indie punk band Knownothing.\r\n\r\n4) Sleep is the name of a Harsh Noise Wall project.

As a solo artist he has released Riot by Candlelight, Christopher, and Hesitation Wounds. As a member of The Chicharones he has released When Pigs Fly, Boss Hogs EP, and Swine Country. \r\n\r\nSleep grew up in the old-school Mexican community of Farmington, NM.

With a fresh, engaging sound that combines the best of contemporary country with compelling faith-based lyrics, High Valley is truly the best of both musical worlds.\r\n\r\n“We always describe ourselves as Dierks Bentley as a trio. It’s that new country kind of vibe,” says Brad Rempel, who along with his brothers Bryan and Curtis comprises High Valley “It’s not as pop as some contemporary country. Our music is a little more organic, a little more acoustic.  We grew up singing harmony as a family and in church. There was always harmony and acoustic instruments, so our live show features a mandolin, an acoustic guitar, a bass guitar and three part harmony.”\r\n\r\nThe Canadian trio has opened shows for Brad Paisley, Keith Urban, LeAnn Rimes and Reba McEntire, earning a solid reputation as a must-see live act. High Valley’s last album, “Broken Borders,” was named Album of the Year at the 2007 GMA Canada Covenant Awards in the country category while their hit “Back to You” was honored as Country Song of the Year. High Valley has also been among the nominees for Group of the Year at the Nashville-based Inspirational Country Music Awards.\r\n\r\n“There’s a huge part of the population that really loves positive faith-based country songs. People want to hear songs with faith and hope instead of desperation and despair, and it does seem like there’s been a spike in the last few years,” Brad says referencing such faith-based country hits as Carrie Underwood’s “Jesus Take the Wheel” and Brooks & Dunn’s “Believe.” “People are searching just a for some encouragement and something to believe in.”\r\n\r\nHigh Valley serves up that kind of music. Skilled musicianship combined with the sibling’s soaring harmonies create a fresh sound that has attracted a legion of enthusiastic fans from Canada to Central America, where the group has a strong fan base in Belize. “We’ve done 60 or so dates in Central America,” says Bryan. “Our sister used to teach at a Christian school there and she gave our CD to a radio station. The station invited us to come and tour. We’ve been back five or six times.”\r\n\r\nThe Canadian-born siblings grew up in Alberta on a farm in the rural community of La Crete. “When you leave Nashville, if you get to the Canadian border, you are only half way home,” says Brad with a laugh.  “La Crete is parallel with Juno, Alaska, just as far north as Juno. Right now you can either cross the river on an ice bridge--so you are actually driving across the river--or you can take two and a half hours worth of gravel road to get there. It’s a pretty remote little town.”\r\n\r\nThe Rempel family relocated to Canada in a rather unusual fashion when the siblings’ paternal grandfather loaded his family onto a truck and drove them from Mexico to Canada. “Our parents were both born in Mexico in a Mennonite colony where they rode horse and buggy and had no electricity,” says Brad. “Then our grandfather bought an old gray truck and as a result, he got kicked out of the colony because that was against the rules to have a vehicle. So he packed up the family and immigrated to Canada with the family in the back of this truck. There were two families, four adults in the front and 20 children on the box and that’s how they made their move all the way to Canada.”\r\n\r\nLife on their farm was dominated by faith, family, hard work and lots of country music. “We always heard Diamond Rio and Ricky Skaggs growing up,” says Bryan. “I love Blackhawk and I always liked listening to the Everly Brothers on the record player. George Jones was played a lot too.”\r\n\r\nIt didn’t take long for the brothers’ own musical aspirations to develop and they knew very early on what they wanted to name the band. “When I was a kid, I had a little tape recorder I used to do mock radio shows,” recalls Brad. “I was the deejay. I was the band. I was the advertising company and everything. The band was always called High Valley.  So when we started our band, we just kind of naturally called it High Valley because that’s what I called every band in my little radio show.”\r\n\r\nBrad was only 12 when the group began performing and Bryan was nine-years-old. Curtis, the youngest sibling, joined the group later on. The brothers performed at Bible and church camps then graduated to opening dates for major country acts such as Canada’s top country artist Paul Brandt. “In 2001, we recorded for the first time in Nashville,” says Brad, “and the following year we spent 110 days on the road, even though we were still in school and had part-time jobs.”\r\n\r\nThe siblings have always enjoyed connecting with people and sharing the gospel with a hurting world. “We play quite a few churches, but I’ve always wanted to be able to sing the music that we sing to an unsaved audience, people who haven’t heard the message of Jesus Christ,” says Curtis. “That’s who we want to sing to and that’s the reason we sing.” \r\n\r\n“Our goal has always been to show the light of Jesus Christ to the world,” adds Brad. “We want to offer a positive, faith-based version of the new country sound. That’s why we play a lot of mainstream festivals, sharing stages with Carrie Underwood, Keith Urban, and Brad Paisley.”\r\n\r\nIn working on their Centricity debut, the members of High Valley want to record songs that will both inspire and entertain. Brad has been busy collaborating with some of Nashville’s top songwriters, among them Cindy Morgan, Tony Wood and Joel Lindsey.\r\n\r\n“We recorded a song called ‘Been Through The Water’ and it says, “Don’t wear your old shoes on your brand new feet when you’ve been through the water,’” Says Brad. “We feel that song really speaks for itself--once Jesus has changed your life, let the world see it and make sure there’s a difference.”\r\nCurtis agrees.  “The Bible it says that our gifts are gifts from God and we need to give them back to him,” he says. “We want to use the gifts that He’s given to us to honor Him and to expand the Kingdom and just to sing to people who need to hear the message.”    <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/High+Valley\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The band is composed of Gerrit Welmers (keyboards and programming), William Cashion (bass, acoustic and electric guitars), Samuel T. Herring (lyrics and vocals) and  Michael Lowry (percussion, since 2020).  Future Islands\' music style has been tagged as synthpop, but the band has routinely rejected that classification, considering themselves as post-wave,by combining the romanticism of new wave with the power and drive of post-punk.\r\n\r\nThe band met and formed in Greenville, North Carolina, USA while studying art at East Carolina University.  Their first band was Art Lord & The Self-Portraits, which was also composed of Adam Beeby and Kymia Nawabi and lasted from 2003 to 2005.  In 2006, Cashion, Herring, and Welmers formed Future Islands, along with Erick Murillo, the bassist for The Kickass. Other former members include Samuel N. Ortiz-Payero (drums, 2008) and Denny Bowen (drums, 2009–2013 in studio; 2013–2014 touring)\r\n\r\nFuture Islands released Little Advances in April 2006, and a self-released split CD with Welmers\' solo project Moss of Aura in January 2007.  In July 2007, they recorded their debut album, Wave Like Home, with Chester Endersby Gwazda at Backdoor Skateshop in Greenville, North Carolina.  After a Halloween party in 2007, Murillo quit the band. In late 2007 and early 2008, the band relocated to Baltimore, Maryland, USA. The \"Feathers and Hallways\" 7\" was recorded in Oakland, California during their first US tour and was their first release as a focused three-piece. Upset! the Rhythm released Wave Like Home on 25 August 2008. The cover art was designed by Kymia Nawabi, a former member of Art Lord & The Self-Portraits. In 2009 the band signed to independent Chicago record company Thrill Jockey.\r\n\r\nTheir second album, In Evening Air, was recorded in the band\'s living room in the historic Marble Hill neighborhood in Baltimore and released on 4 May 2010.Their third full-length album, On the Water, was recorded in Elizabeth City, NC\'s historic, waterfront Andrew S. Sanders House. It was released on 11 October 2011. \r\n\r\nThese early albums from Future Islands are often associated with other bands affiliated with Wham City, such as Videohippos, Santa Dads, Blood Baby, OCDJ, Adventure, Dan Deacon, Weekends and Double Dagger.\r\n\r\nIn 2014, they released Singles with hit-track Seasons (Waiting on You). The band and song gained critical acclamation from Pitchfork and NME and performed the song on the Late Show with David Letterman, a performance that went viral. In 2017, they released The Far Field and most recently in 2020 they released As Long As You Are. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Future+Islands\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Though an occasional songwriter herself, she is better known as an interpreter of other songwriters\' works.\r\n\r\nHer career began in 1967 with the release of folk-rock group The Stone Poneys\' self-titled album. After the break-up of the Stone Poneys, Linda entered the country music field. In 1969, with the release of \'Hand Sown... Home Grown\', Ronstadt became the first female singer to release an alt-country album.\r\n\r\nRonstadt achieved her greatest commercial success in the mid-\'70s. A singer and record producer, she is recognized as a definitive interpreter of songs. Being one of music\'s most versatile and commercially successful female singers in U.S. history, she is recognized for her many public stages of self-reinvention and incarnations.\r\n\r\nWith a one-time standing as the Queen of Rock, where she was bestowed the title of \"highest paid woman in rock\", and known as the First Lady of Rock, she has more recently emerged as music matriarch, international arts advocate and Human Rights advocate.\r\n\r\nRonstadt has collaborated with artists from a diverse spectrum of genres—including Billy Eckstine, Frank Zappa, Rosemary Clooney, Flaco Jiménez, Philip Glass, The Chieftains, Gram Parsons, Dolly Parton and has lent her voice to over 120 albums around the world. Christopher Loudon of Jazz Times noted in 2004, Ronstadt is \"Blessed with arguably the most sterling set of pipes of her generation ... rarest of rarities—a chameleon who can blend into any background yet remain boldly distinctive ... It\'s an exceptional gift; one shared by few others.\r\n\r\nIn total, she has released over 30 solo albums, more than 15 compilations or greatest hits albums. Ronstadt has charted thirty-eight Billboard Hot 100 singles, twenty-one of which have reached the top 40, ten of which have reached the top 10, three peaking at #2, the #1 hit, \"You\'re No Good\". In the UK, her single \"Blue Bayou\" reached the UK Top 40 and the duet with Aaron Neville, \"Don\'t Know Much\", peaked at #2 in December 1989. In addition, she has charted thirty-six albums, ten Top 10 albums, and three #1 albums on the Billboard Pop Album Charts.\r\n\r\nRonstadt is considered an \"interpreter of her times\", and has earned praise for her courage to put her own unique \"stamp\" on many of these songs. Although many of her hits were criticized for being cover songs, they were the songs the record companies elected to cull and release off the albums. More importantly, Linda Ronstadt became a highly successful \"Albums Artist\", some of which contain material written by her. Ronstadt\'s natural vocal range spans several octaves from contralto to soprano, and occasionally she will showcase this entire range within a single work. Ronstadt was the first female artist in popular music history to accumulate four consecutive platinum albums (fourteen certified million selling, to date). As for the singles, Rolling Stone Magazine pointed out that a whole generation, \"but for her, might never have heard the work of artists such as Buddy Holly, Elvis Costello, and Chuck Berry.\"\r\n\r\n\"\"Music is meant to lighten your load. By singing it ... you release (the sadness). And release yourself ... an exercise in exorcism.... You exorcise that emotion ... and diminish sadness and feel joy.\"\r\nLinda Ronstadt.\r\n\r\nOthers have argued that Ronstadt had the same generational effect with her Great American Songbook music, exposing a whole new generation to the music of the 1920s and \'30s—music which, ironically, was pushed aside because of the advent of rock \'n\' roll. When interpreting, Ronstadt said she \"sticks to what the music demands\", in terms of lyrics. Explaining that rock and roll music is part of her culture, she says that the songs she sang after her rock and roll hits were part of her soul. \"The (Mariachi music) was my father\'s side of the soul\", she was quoted as saying in a 1998 interview she gave at her Tucson home. \"My mother\'s side of my soul was the Nelson Riddle stuff. And I had to do them both in order to reestablish who I was.\"\r\n\r\nIn the 1974 book Rock \'N\' Roll Woman, author Katherine Orloff writes that Ronstadt\'s \"own musical preferences run strongly to rhythm and blues, the type of music she most frequently chooses to listen to ... (and) her goal is to ... be soulful too. With this in mind, Ronstadt fuses country and rock into a special union.\r\n\r\n\r\nAuthor Father Andrew Greeley, in his book God in Popular Culture, described Ronstadt as \"the most successful and certainly the most durable and most gifted woman Rock singer of her era.\" Signaling her wide popularity as a concert artist, outside of the singles charts and the recording studio, Dirty Linen magazine describes her as the \"first true woman rock \'n\' roll superstar ... (selling) out stadiums with a string of mega-successful albums.\" Amazon.com defines her as the American female rock superstar of the decade. Cash Box gave Ronstadt a Special Decade Award, as the top selling female singer of the 1970s. Coupled with the fact that her album covers, posters, magazine covers—basically her entire rock n roll image conveyed—was just as famous as her music. That by the end of the decade, the singer whom the Chicago Sun Times described as the \"Dean of the 1970s school of female rock singers\" became what Redbook called, \"the most successful female rock star in the world\",\"Female\" being the important qualifier, according to Time magazine, labeling her \"a rarity ... to (have survived) ... in the shark-infested deeps of rock.\"\r\nLinda Ronstadt, ca. 1974, on the cover of the Grammy winning album and 2x platinum certified studio disc, Heart Like a Wheel.\r\n\r\nHaving been a cult favorite on the music scene for several years, 1975 was \"remembered in the music biz as the year when 29-year-old Linda Ronstadt belatedly happened.\" With the release of Heart Like A Wheel, Ronstadt reached #1 on the Billboard Album Chart (it was also the first of four #1 Country Albums for Ronstadt) and the disc was certified Double-Platinum (over 2 million copies sold in the United States). In many instances, her own interpretations were more successful than the original recordings and many times new songwriters were discovered by a larger audience as a result of Ronstadt interpreting and recording their songs. Interestingly, Ronstadt had major success interpreting songs from a diverse spectrum of artists. This skill would eventually serve her later in her career, as a noted master song interpreter.\r\n\r\nHeart Like A Wheel\'s first single release was \"You\'re No Good\"—a rockified version of an R&B song written by Clint Ballard, Jr. that Ronstadt had initially resisted because Andrew Gold\'s guitar tracks sounded too much like a \"Beatles song\" to her—climbed to #1 on both the Billboard and Cash Box Pop singles charts. The album\'s second single release was \"When Will I Be Loved\"—an uptempo Country Rock version of a Top 10 Everly Brothers song—hit #1 in Cash Box and #2 in Billboard. The song was also Linda\'s first #1 Country hit.\r\n\r\nThe album showed a physically attractive Ronstadt on the cover but, more importantly, its critical and commercial success was due to a fine presentation of country and rock with Heart Like A Wheel, her first of many major commercial successes that would set her on the path to being one of the best-selling female artists of all time. Ronstadt won her first Grammy Award for Best Country Vocal Performance/Female for \"I Can\'t Help It (If I\'m Still In Love With You)\" which was originally a 1940s hit by Hank Williams. Ronstadt\'s interpretation peaked at #2 on the Country charts. The album itself was nominated for the Album of the Year Grammy as well as the Best Pop Vocal Performance/Female trophy.\r\n\r\nRolling Stone magazine put Linda on its cover in March 1975. This was the first of six Rolling Stone magazine covers shot by photographer Annie Leibovitz. It included her as the featured artist with a full photo layout and an article by Ben Fong-Torres, discussing Ronstadt\'s many struggling years in rock n roll, as well as her home life and what it was like to be a woman on tour in a decidedly all-male environment.\r\n\r\nIn September 1975, Linda\'s album Prisoner In Disguise was released. It quickly climbed into the Top Five on the Billboard Album Chart and sold over a million copies. It became her second in a row to go platinum, \"a grand slam\" in the same year (Ronstadt would eventually be the first female artist in popular music history to have three consecutive platinum albums and would ultimately go on to have eight consecutive platinum albums, and then another six between 1983 and 1990). The disc\'s first single release was \"Love Is A Rose\". It was climbing the Pop and Country charts but Heat Wave, a rockified version of the 1963 hit by Martha and the Vandellas, was receiving considerable airplay. Asylum pulled the \"Love Is A Rose\" single and issued \"Heat Wave\" with \"Love Is A Rose\" on the B-side. \"Heat Wave\" hit the Top Five on Billboard\'s Hot 100 while \"Love Is A Rose\" hit the Top Five on Billboard\'s Country chart.\r\nLinda Ronstadt, ca. 1977, on the cover of the Grammy winning album design and 3x platinum certified studio disc, Simple Dreams.\r\n\r\nIn 1976, Ronstadt reached the Top 3 of Billboard\'s Album Chart and won her second career Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for her third consecutive platinum album Hasten Down The Wind. The album featured a sexy, revealing cover shot and showcased Ronstadt the singer-songwriter, who composed two of its songs, \"Try Me Again\" and \"Lo Siento Mi Vida\". It also included an interpretation of Willie Nelson\'s classic \"Crazy\", which became a Top 10 Country hit for Ronstadt in early 1977.\r\n\r\nAt the end of 1977, Ronstadt surpassed the success of Heart Like A Wheel with her album Simple Dreams, which held the #1 position for five consecutive weeks on the Billboard Album Chart. It also knocked Elvis Presley out of #1 on Billboard\'s Country Albums chart. It sold over 3½ million copies in less than a year in the U.S. alone. The album was released in September 1977, and by December it had replaced Fleetwood Mac\'s long running #1 album Rumours in the top spot. Simple Dreams spawned a string of hit singles on numerous charts. Among them were the RIAA platinum-certified single \"Blue Bayou\", a Country Rock interpretation of a Roy Orbison song, \"It\'s So Easy\"—previously sung by Buddy Holly—and \"Poor Poor Pitiful Me\", a song written by Warren Zevon, an up and coming songwriter of the time whom Ronstadt elected to highlight and record. The album garnered several Grammy Award nominations—including Record of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Performance/Female for \"Blue Bayou\"—and won its art director, Kosh, a Grammy Award for Best Album Cover, the first of three Grammy Awards he would win for designing Ronstadt album covers.\r\n\r\nSimple Dreams became one of the singer\'s most successful international selling albums as well, reaching #1 on the Australian and Canadian Pop and Country Albums charts. Simple Dreams also made Ronstadt the most successful international female touring artist as well. The same year, she completed a highly successful concert tour around Europe. As Country Music Magazine wrote in October 1978, Simple Dreams solidified Ronstadt\'s role as \"easily the most successful female rock and roll and country star at this time.\"\r\n\r\nAlso in 1977, she was asked by the Los Angeles Dodgers to sing the U.S. National Anthem at game three of the World Series against the New York Yankees.\r\n\r\nRonstadt has remarked that she felt as though she was \"artificially encouraged to kinda cop a really tough attitude (and be tough) because Rock & Roll is kind of tough (business)\", which she felt wasn\'t worn quite authentically. Female rock artists like her and Janis Joplin, whom she described as lovely, shy and very literate in real life and the antithesis of the \"red hot mamma\" routine she was artificially encouraged to project, went through an identity crisis.\r\nLinda Ronstadt, on the cover of the February 28, 1977, issue of Time.\r\n\r\nEventually, Ronstadt\'s Rock & Roll image became just as famous as her music by the mid 1970s. The 1977 appearance on the cover of Time magazine under the banner \"Torchy Rock\" was controversial for Ronstadt, considering what the image appeared to project about the most famous woman in rock. At a time in the industry when men still told women what to sing and what to wear, Ronstadt hated the image of her that was projected to the world on the cover of Time magazine, and she noted recently how the photographer kept forcing her to wear a dress, which was an image she did not want to project (although she wore a rather revealing dress for the cover of Hasten Down the Wind which projected an image of her not all that different from the Time magazine cover). In 2004, she was interviewed for CBS This Morning and stated that this image was not her because she didn\'t sit like that. Asher noted, \"anyone who\'s met Linda for 10 seconds will know that I couldn\'t possibly have been her Svengali. She\'s an extremely determined woman, in every area. To me, she was everything that feminism\'s about. Qualities which, Asher has stated, were considered a \"negative (in a woman at that time), whereas in a man they were perceived as being masterful and bold\". Since her solo career began, Ronstadt has fought hard to be recognized as a solo female singer in the world of rock, and her portrayal on the Time cover didn\'t appear to help the situation. It was in 1976 that Rolling Stone magazine published in its cover story an alluring collection of photographs taken by Annie Leibovitz, which helped to further the image that Ronstadt later said she wasn\'t pleased with. Ronstadt and Asher claim to have viewed the photos prior to publication and, when asked that they be removed and the request was denied, they unceremoniously threw Leibovitz out of the house.\r\nIn 1978 Rolling Stone magazine declared Ronstadt, \"by far America\'s best-known female rock singer\". She scored a third #1 album on the Billboard Album Chart—unsurpassed by any female artist at this point in time—with Living In The USA. Linda achieved a major hit single with \"Ooh Baby Baby\", with her rendition hitting all four major singles charts (Pop, AC, Country and R&B). Living In The USA was the first album by any recording act, in music history, to ship double-platinum (over 2 million advanced copies). The album eventually sold 3 million U.S. copies.\r\nLinda Ronstadt\'s promotional poster, for the 1978 Living In The USA album and concert\r\n\r\nBillboard magazine crowned Linda Ronstadt with three #1 Awards for the Year: #1 Pop Female Singles Artist of the Year; #1 Pop Female Album Artist of the Year; #1 Female Artist of the Year (overall).\r\n\r\nLiving In The USA showed the singer on roller skates with a newly short, permed hairdo on the album cover. Ronstadt continued this theme on concert tour promotional posters with photos of her on roller skates in a dramatic pose with a large American flag in the background. By this stage of her career, she was promoting every album released, with posters and concerts—which at the time were recorded live on radio and/or TV. Ronstadt was also featured in the 1978 film FM, where the plot involved disc jockeys attempting to broadcast a Linda Ronstadt concert live, without a competing station\'s knowledge. The movie also showed Ronstadt performing the songs Poor Poor Pitiful Me, Love Me Tender, and Tumbling Dice. Ronstadt was persuaded to record \"Tumbling Dice\" after Mick Jagger came backstage when she was at a concert and said, \"You do too many ballads, you should do more rock and roll songs.\"\r\n\r\nFollowing the success of Living in the USA, Ronstadt not only conducted successful disc promotional tours and concerts but in one concert in 1978, Ronstadt made a guest appearance onstage with The Rolling Stones at the Tucson Community Center on July 21, 1978, in her hometown of Tucson, where Ronstadt and Mick Jagger vocalized on \"Tumbling Dice\". On singing with Jagger, Ronstadt reflects \" I loved it. I didn\'t have a trace of stage fright. I\'m scared to death all the way through my own shows. But it was too much fun to get scared. He\'s so silly onstage, he knocks you over. I mean you have to be on your toes or you wind up falling on your face.\"\r\n[edit] Highest paid woman in rock\r\n\r\n\"Rock is the thumping heart of Linda\'s music, and the rock world is dominated by males. The biggest stars are male, and so are the back-up musicians ... rock beats are ... phallic, and lyrics ... masculine.... Janis Joplin, the first great white woman rocker, rattled the bars ... but she died.... Joni Mitchell ... stylish (but can’t) compete in drawing power with men ... (however) Linda Ronstadt ... has made herself one of the biggest individual rock draws in the world.\"\r\n\r\nBy the end of 1978, Ronstadt had solidified her role as one of rock and pop\'s most successful solo female acts, and owing to her consistent platinum album success, and her ability as the first-ever woman to sell out concerts in arenas and stadiums hosting tens of thousands of fans, Ronstadt became the \"highest paid woman in rock\". She had six platinum certified albums, three of which went to #1 on the Billboard album chart, and numerous charted Pop singles. In 1978 alone, she made over $12 million (equivalent to $38,000,000 in today\'s dollars) and in the same year her albums sales were reported to be 17 million—grossing over $60 million (equivalent to a gross of over $170,000,000, in today\'s dollars).\r\n\r\nAs Rolling Stone magazine dubbed her \"Rock\'s Venus\", her record sales continued to multiply and set records themselves. By 1979, Ronstadt had collected eight gold, six platinum and four multi-platinum certifications for her albums, an unprecedented feat at the time. Her 1976 Greatest Hits album would sell consistently for the next 25 years and in 2001 was certified by the RIAA for 7 times platinum (over 7 million U.S. copies sold). In 1980, Greatest Hits Volume II was released and certified platinum.\r\n\r\nIn 1979, Ronstadt went on a successful international tour, playing in arenas across Australia to Japan, including the Olympic Park Stadium in Melbourne, Australia and the Budokan in Tokyo, Japan. She also participated in a benefit concert for her friend Lowell George, held at The Forum, in Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the decade, Ronstadt had outsold her female competition; no other female artist to date had five straight platinum LPs: Hasten Down the Wind, and Heart Like a Wheel among them.[84] US Magazine reported in 1978, that Linda Ronstadt, Stevie Nicks, Carly Simon and Joni Mitchell had become \"The Queens of Rock\" and \'Rock is no longer exclusively male. There is a new royalty ruling today\'s record charts\'.\r\n\r\nShe would go on to parlay her mass commercial appeal with major success in interpreting The Great American Songbook, made famous a generation before by Frank Sinatra, and Ella Fitzgerald and later the Mexican folk songs of her childhood.\r\n\r\nIn 1980 Ronstadt recorded Mad Love, her seventh consecutive platinum selling album. Mad Love is a straightforward Rock & Roll album with post-punk, new wave influences, including tracks by songwriters such as Elvis Costello, The Cretones, and musician Mark Goldenberg who played on the record himself. She also made the cover of Rolling Stone Magazine for a record-setting sixth time. Mad Love entered the Billboard Album Chart in the Top Five its first week (a record at that time) and climbed to the #3 position. The project continued her streak of Top 10 hits with \"How Do I Make You?\", originally recorded by Billy Thermal, and \"Hurt So Bad\", originally a Top 10 hit for Little Anthony & the Imperials. The album earned Ronstadt a 1980 Grammy Award nomination for Best Rock Vocal Performance/Female (although she lost to Pat Benatar\'s Crimes of Passion album). Benatar praised Linda Ronstadt by stating, \"There are a lot of good female singers around. How could I be the best? Ronstadt is still alive!\"\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1980 Ronstadt began rehearsals for the first of several leads in Broadway musicals. Joseph Papp cast her as the lead in the New York Shakespeare Festival production of Gilbert and Sullivan\'s The Pirates of Penzance, alongside Kevin Kline.She said singing Gilbert and Sullivan was a natural choice for her, since her grandfather Fred Ronstadt was credited with having created Tucson\'s first orchestra, the Club Filarmonico Tucsonense, and had once created an arrangement of The Pirates of Penzance.\r\n\r\nThe Pirates of Penzance opened for a limited engagement in New York City\'s Central Park, eventually moving its production to Broadway, where it became a major hit, running from January 8, 1981, to November 28, 1982.Newsweek was effusive in its praise: \"... she has not dodged the coloratura demands of her role (and Mabel is one of the most demanding parts in the G&S canon): from her entrance trilling \'Poor Wand\'ring One,\' it is clear that she is prepared to scale whatever soprano peaks stand in her way.\" Ronstadt co-starred with Kline and Angela Lansbury in the 1983 motion picture version of the Gilbert and Sullivan operetta. Ronstadt received a Golden Globe nomination for the role in the movie version. She garnered a Tony Award nomination for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical and The Pirates of Penzance won several Tony Awards, including a Tony Award for Best Revival.\r\n\r\nAs a child, Ronstadt had discovered La Bohème through the silent movie with Lillian Gish and was determined to someday play the part of Mimi. When she met the late opera superstar Beverly Sills, she was told, \"My dear, every soprano in the world wants to play Mimi!\" In 1984 Ronstadt was cast in the role at Joseph Papp\'s Public Theatre. However, the production was a critical and commercial disaster, closing after only a few nights.\r\n\r\nIn 1988 Ronstadt would return to Broadway for a limited-run engagement in the musical show adaptation of her album celebrating her Mexican heritage, Canciones De Mi Padre—A Romantic Evening In Old Mexico.\r\n\r\nIn 1982 Ronstadt released Get Closer—a primarily rock album with some country and pop music as well. It remains her only album between 1975 and 1990 not to be officially certified Platinum. It peaked at #31 on the Billboard Album Chart. The release continued her streak of Top 40 hits with \"Get Closer\" and \"I Knew You When\"—a 1965 hit by Billy Joe Royal—while the Jimmy Webb song \"Easy For You To Say\" was a surprise Top 10 Adult Contemporary hit in the spring of 1983. \"Sometimes You Just Can\'t Win\" was released to country radio, and made it to #27 on that listing. Linda also filmed several music videos for this album which became popular on the fledgling MTV cable channel. The album earned Ronstadt two Grammy Award nominations: one for Best Rock Vocal Performance/Female for the title track and another for Best Pop Vocal Performance/Female for the album. The artwork won its art director, Kosh, his second Grammy Award for Best Album Package.\r\n\r\nAlong with the release of her Get Closer album, Ronstadt embarked on a very successful North American tour, remaining one of the top rock concert draws that summer and fall. On November 25, 1982, Linda\'s \'Happy Thanksgiving Day\' concert was held at the Reunion Arena in Dallas and broadcast live via satellite on radio stations across the United States.\r\n[edit] Sentimental journeys\r\n\r\nRonstadt has remarked that in the beginning of her career \"(she) ... was so focused on folk, rock and country that..(she) got a bit bored and started to branch out, and ... (has) been doing that ever since.\"  By 1983, Linda Ronstadt\'s estimated worth was over $40 million mostly from successful records, concerts and merchandising.\r\n\r\nRonstadt eventually tired of playing arenas. She had ceased to feel that arenas, where people milled around smoking marijuana cigarettes and drinking beer, were \"appropriate places for music.\" She wanted \"angels in the architecture\"—a reference to a lyric in the Paul Simon song \"You Can Call Me Al\" from the 1986 album Graceland. (Ronstadt sang harmony with Simon on a different Graceland track, \"Under African Skies.\" The lyrics pay tribute to Ronstadt: \"Take this child, Lord, from Tucson, Arizona....\") Ronstadt has said she wants to sing in places similar to the Theatre of ancient Greece, where the attention is focused on the stage and performer.\r\n\r\nRonstadt\'s recording output in the 1980s proved to be just as commercially and critically successful as her 1970s recordings. Between 1983 and 1990 Ronstadt scored six additional platinum albums; two of these have been certified triple platinum (each with over 3 million U.S. copies sold); one has been certified double platinum (over two million copies sold); and one has earned additional certification as a Gold (over 500,000 U.S. copies sold) double disc album.\r\n\r\nBy recording Traditional pop, Traditional country, Traditional Latin roots, and Adult Contemporary, Ronstadt resonated with a different fan base and diversified her appeal.\r\nJazz/pop trilogy\r\nLinda Ronstadt, ca. 1983, from the disc What\'s New, Volume One of \"The \'Round Midnight\' Trilogy.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1981 Linda Ronstadt produced and recorded an album of jazz and pop standards (later marketed in bootleg form) titled Keeping Out of Mischief with the assistance of producer Jerry Wexler. However, Ronstadt\'s displeasure with the final result led her, with regrets, to scrap the project. \"Doing that killed me\", she said in a Time magazine interview. But the appeal of the album\'s music had seduced Ronstadt, as she told Down Beat magazine in April 1985, crediting Wexler for encouraging her.[96] Nonetheless, Ronstadt had to somehow convince her reticent record company, Elektra Records, to greenlight this type of album under her contract.\r\n\r\nBy 1983 Ronstadt had enlisted the help of 62-year-old conductor and master of jazz/traditional pop orchestration, Nelson Riddle. The two embarked on an unorthodox and original approach to rehabilitating the Great American Songbook, recording a trilogy of highly successful jazz/ traditional pop albums: What\'s New (1983—U.S. 3.7 million as of 2010); Lush Life (1984—U.S. 1.7 million as of 2010); and For Sentimental Reasons (1986—U.S. 1.3 million as of 2010). The three albums have a combined sales total of nearly 7 million copies in the United States alone.\r\n\r\n\"I now realize I was taking a tremendous risk, and that Joe Smith (the head of Elektra Records, and strongly opposed) was looking out for himself, and for me. When it became apparent I wouldn\'t change my mind, he said: \'I love Nelson so much! Can I please come to the sessions. I said \'Yes.\' \"When the albums ... were successful, Joe congratulated me, and I never said \'I told you so.\'\"\r\nLinda Ronstadt\r\n\r\nThe album design for What\'s New by designer Kosh was unlike any of her previous disc covers. It showed Ronstadt in a vintage dress lying on shimmering satin sheets with a Walkman headset. At the time, Ronstadt received some chiding for both the album cover and her venture into what was then considered \"elevator music\" by cynics, but remained determined to record with Nelson Riddle, and What\'s New became a hit. The album was released in September 1983, it spent 81 weeks on the Billboard Album Chart and held the #3 position for a month and a half (held out of the top spot by Michael Jackson\'s \'Thriller\' and Lionel Richie\'s \'Can\'t Slow Down\') and the RIAA certified it triple platinum (over 3 million U.S. copies sold alone). The album earned Ronstadt another Grammy nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, and critical raves, with Time magazine calling it \"one of the gutsiest, most unorthodox and unexpected albums of the year\".\r\n\r\nRonstadt faced considerable pressure not to record What\'s New or record with Riddle. According to jazz historian Peter Levinson, author of the book September In The Rain—a Biography on Nelson Riddle, Joe Smith, president of Elektra Records, was terrified that the Nelson Riddle album would turn off Ronstadt\'s rock audience. Linda did not completely turn her back on her rock and roll past, however; the video for the title track featured Danny Kortchmar as the old beau that she bumped into during a rainstorm.\r\n\r\nWhat\'s New brought Nelson Riddle to a younger audience. According to Levinson, \"the younger audience hated what Riddle had done with Frank Sinatra,which in 1983 was considered \'Vintage Pop.\'\" Working with Ronstadt, Riddle brought his career back into focus in the last three years of his life. Stephen Holden of The New York Times wrote, What\'s New \"isn\'t the first album by a rock singer to pay tribute to the golden age of the pop, but is ... the best and most serious attempt to rehabilitate an idea of pop that Beatlemania and the mass marketing of rock LPs for teenagers undid in the mid-60s.... In the decade prior to Beatlemania, most of the great band singers and crooners of the 40s and 50s codified a half-century of American pop standards on dozens of albums ... many of them now long out-of-print.\" What\'s New is the first album by a rock singer to have major commercial success in rehabilitating the Great American Songbook.\r\n\r\nIn 1984 Ronstadt and Nelson Riddle performed these songs live, in concert halls throughout Australia, Japan and the United States, including multi-night performances at historic venues Carnegie Hall, Radio City Music Hall and Pine Knob.\r\n\r\nIn 2004 Ronstadt released Hummin\' to Myself, her album for Verve Records. It was her first foray into traditional jazz since her sessions with Jerry Wexler and her records with the Nelson Riddle Orchestra, but this time with an intimate jazz combo. The album was a quiet affair for Ronstadt, giving few interviews and making only one television performance as promotion. It reached #2 on Billboard\'s Top Jazz Albums chart but peaked at #166 on the main Billboard album chart. Not having the mass distribution that Warner Music gave her, Hummin\' To Myself had sold over 75,000 copies in the U.S. as of 2010—which is quite successful for a small record label like Verve Records. It also achieved some critical acclaim from the jazz cognoscenti.\r\n\r\n\"When (we) sang, it was a beautiful and different sound I\'ve never heard before. We (recorded the vocals) as individual parts, because we didn\'t have the luxury of spending a lot of time together on a tour bus ... and knowing each other\'s (vocal) moves ... takes years.\"\r\nLinda Ronstadt\r\n\r\nIn 1978, Ronstadt, with Dolly Parton and Emmylou Harris, began recording a Trio album. Unfortunately, the attempt was not successful. Ronstadt later remarked that not too many people were in control at the time and everyone was too involved with their own careers. (Though the efforts to complete the album were abandoned, a number of the more successful recordings were included on the singers\' respective solo recordings over the next few years.) This concept album was put on the back burner for almost ten years.\r\n\r\nIn January 1986, the three eventually did make their way into the recording studio, where they spent the next several months working. The result, Trio, which they had conceived ten years earlier, was released in March 1987. It was a considerable hit, holding the #1 position on Billboard\'s Country Albums chart for five weeks running and hitting the Top 10 on the Pop side also. Selling over three million U.S. copies and winning them a Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, it produced four Top Ten Country singles including \"To Know Him Is To Love Him\" which hit #1. The album was also a nominee for overall Album of the Year, in the company of Michael Jackson, U2, Prince, and Whitney Houston.\r\n\r\nIn 1994, the three performers recorded a follow-up to Trio. As was the case with their aborted 1978 effort, conflicting schedules and competing priorities delayed the album\'s release indefinitely. Ronstadt, who had already paid for studio time—and owed her record company a finished album—removed Dolly\'s individual tracks at her request, kept Emmylou\'s vocals on, and produced a number of the recordings, which she subsequently released on her 1995 return to Country Rock, Feels Like Home.\r\n\r\nHowever, in 1999, Ronstadt, Parton and Harris agreed to release the Trio II album, as was originally recorded in 1994. It included an ethereal cover of Neil Young\'s \"After The Gold Rush\" which became a popular music video. The effort was certified Gold (over 500,000 copies sold) and won them a Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals for the track. Ronstadt co-produced the album with George Massenburg and the three ladies also received a Grammy Nomination for Best Country Album.\r\n[edit] Canciones—songs of the Ronstadt family\r\nLinda Ronstadt, ca. 1987, on the cover of the Grammy winning album and 2x platinum certified Canciones de Mi Padre—\"Songs Of My Father.\"\r\nRonstadt\'s follow-up mariachi album Mas Canciones won the 1993 Grammy Award for Best Mexican/Mexican-American Album.\r\n\r\nAt the end of 1987, Ronstadt released an album of traditional Mexican folk songs, or what she describes as \"world class songs\", titled Canciones de Mi Padre. Keeping with the Ronstadt history theme, her cover art was dramatic, bold, and colorful. For Canciones De Mi Padre, Ronstadt was in full Mexican regalia, and her musical arranger was famed Mariachi musician Rubén Fuentes.\r\n\r\nThese canciones were a big part of Ronstadt\'s family tradition and musical roots. For example, the history of this album goes back half a century. In January 1946, the University of Arizona published a booklet by Luisa Espinel entitled Canciones de mi Padre.Luisa Espinel, Ronstadt\'s aunt, was herself an international singer in the 1920s and 1930s. Ms. Espinel\'s father was Fred Ronstadt, Linda\'s grandfather, and the songs she had learned, transcribed and published were some of the ones he had brought with him from Sonora. Ronstadt researched and extracted from the favorites she had learned from her father Gilbert and she called her album by the same name as her aunt\'s booklet and as a tribute to her father and his family. Though not fully bilingual, she has a fairly good command of the Spanish language, allowing her to sing Latin American songs with little discernible Anglo accent; Ronstadt has often identified herself as Mexican-American. Her formative years were spent with her father\'s side of the family. In fact, in 1976, Ronstadt had collaborated with her father to write and compose a Traditional Mexican folk ballad titled \"Lo siento mi vida\", a song that she included in her Grammy winning album Hasten Down the Wind. Also, Ronstadt has credited Mexican singer Lola Beltrán as an influence in her own singing style, and she recalls how a frequent guest to the Ronstadt home, Eduardo \"Lalo\" Guerrero, father of Chicano music, would often serenade her as a child.\r\n\r\nThis album won Ronstadt a Grammy Award for Best Mexican-American Performance. The real achievement, however, is the disc\'s RIAA double-platinum (over 2 million U.S. copies sold) certification—making it the biggest-selling non-English language album in U.S. music history. Another achievement is that the album and later theatrical stage show, served as a benchmark of Latin cultural renaissance in North America.\r\n\r\n\"(I obtained) enough clout and ... after years and years of making commercial records, I was entitled to experiment ... the success of the (Nelson Riddle albums) ... entitled me to try the Mexican stuff.\"\r\nLinda Ronstadt \r\n\r\nRonstadt produced and performed a theatrical stage show in concert halls across the United States and Latin America to both Hispanic and non-Hispanic audiences, including on the Great White Way. She called the stage show by the same name Canciones de mi Padre. These performances were released on DVD. Ronstadt elected to return to the Broadway stage, 4 years after she performed in La Bohème, for a limited run engagement. PBS Great Performances aired the celebrated stage show during its annual fund drives and the show was a hit with audiences, earning Ronstadt an Emmy Award for Individual Performance In A Variety Or Music Program.\r\n\r\nLinda later recorded two additional discs of Latin music in the early 1990s. Although their promotion, like most of her albums in the 1990s, were a quieter affair for Ronstadt, where she appeared to do the \"bare minimum\" to promote them. They were not nearly as successful as Canciones De Mi Padre, but were critically acclaimed in some circles. In 1991 she released Mas Canciones, a follow up to the first Canciones. For this effort she won a Grammy award for Best Mexican/Mexican-American Album. The following year she stepped outside of the Mariachi genre and decided to record well known \"afro-Cuban\" songs. This disc was titled Frenesí. Like her two previous Latin recordings ventures, this third Latin album won Ronstadt another Grammy award, this time for Best Traditional Tropical Latin Album.\r\n\r\nIn 1991 Ronstadt acted in the lead role of arch angel San Miguel in La Pastorela, or A Shephard\'s Tale, a musical filmed at San Juan Bautista. It was written and directed by Luis Valdez. The production was part of the PBS \"Great Performances\" series. (As of December 2010, it existed on VHS format but had not been released on DVD by that time.)\r\n\r\nReturning to the pop music scene\r\n\r\nBy the late 1980s, while enjoying the success of her big band jazz collaborations with Nelson Riddle and her surprise hit Mariachi recordings, Linda Ronstadt elected to return to recording mainstream pop music once again. In 1987 she made a return to the top of Billboard Hot 100 singles chart with \"Somewhere Out There\", which peaked at #2 in March. Featured in the animated film An American Tail, the sentimental duet with James Ingram was nominated for several Grammy Awards, ultimately winning \"Song of the Year.\" It also received an Academy Award nomination for Best Motion Picture song and achieved high sales, earning a million-selling Gold single in the U.S.—one of the last 45s ever to do so. It was also accompanied by a popular music video. On the heels of this success, Steven Spielberg asked Ronstadt to record the theme song for the animated sequel titled An American Tail: Fievel Goes West, which was titled \"Dreams To Dream.\" Although \"Dreams To Dream\" failed to achieve the success of \"Somewhere Out There\", the song did give Ronstadt an Adult Contemporary hit in 1991.\r\n\r\nIn 1989, Ronstadt released a mainstream pop album and several popular singles. This effort, titled Cry Like A Rainstorm, Howl Like The Wind, became one of the singer\'s most successful albums—in terms of production, arrangements, chart sales, and critical acclaim. It became Ronstadt\'s tenth Top 10 album on the Billboard chart, reaching the #7 position and being certified triple-platinum (over 3 million U.S. copies sold). The album also garnered critical acclaim, receiving numerous Grammy nominations and being praised by Amazon.com as \"an album that defines virtually everything that is right about adult contemporary pop.\" Linda featured New Orleans soul singer Aaron Neville on several of the twelve disc cuts.\r\n\r\nRonstadt incorporated the sounds of the Oakland Interfaith Gospel Choir, Tower of Power horns, the Skywalker Symphony and numerous musicians. It had duets, including \"Don\'t Know Much\" (Billboard Hot 100 #2 hit—Christmas 1989) and \"All My Life\" (Billboard Hot 100 #11 hit), both of which were long-running #1 Adult Contemporary hits. These duets with Aaron Neville received much critical acclaim, earning several Grammy nominations. The duo won both the 1989 and 1990 Best Pop Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal awards. Linda\'s last known live Grammy Award appearance was in 1990 when she and Neville performed \"Don\'t Know Much\" together on the telecast. (\"Whenever I sing with a different artist, I can get things out of my voice that I can\'t do by myself\", Ronstadt reflected in 2007. \"I can do things with Aaron that I can\'t do alone.\")\r\n\r\nIn December 1990, Linda Ronstadt participated in a concert held at the Tokyo Dome to commemorate John Lennon\'s 50th birthday, and to raise awareness of environmental issues. Other participants included Miles Davis, Lenny Kravitz, Hall & Oates, Natalie Cole, Japanese artists, Yoko Ono and Sean Lennon. A CD resulted, titled Happy Birthday, John.\r\n\r\nContinuing with her crafted approach to more mainstream-oriented material, Ronstadt released the highly acclaimed Winter Light album at the end of 1993. It included New Age arrangements such as the lead single \"Heartbeats Accelerating\" as well as the self-penned title track and featured the unique glass armonica instrument. But alas, it was Linda\'s first commercial failure since 1972, and peaked at a disappointing #92 in Billboard, whereas 1995\'s Feels Like Home was Ronstadt\'s much heralded return to Country-Rock and included her version of Tom Petty\'s classic hit \"The Waiting.\" The single\'s rollicking, fiddle-infused flip side, \"Walk On\", returned Linda to the Country Singles chart for the first time since 1983. An album track entitled \"The Blue Train\" charted 10 weeks in Billboard\'s Adult Contemporary Top 40. This album fared slightly better than its predecessor, reaching #75. Both albums were later deleted from the Elektra/Asylum catalog.\r\n\r\nIn 1996 Ronstadt produced Dedicated to the One I Love, an album of classic rock \'n roll songs reinvented as lullabies. The disc reached #78 in Billboard. Ronstadt was awarded a Grammy in the Best Musical Album for Children category.\r\n\r\nIn 1998 Ronstadt released We Ran, her first album in over two years. The disc harkened back to Ronstadt\'s country-rock and folk-rock heyday. She returned to her rock \'n\' roll roots with vivid interpretations of songs by Bruce Springsteen, Doc Pomus, Bob Dylan and John Hiatt. The recording was produced by Glyn Johns. A commercial failure, the album stands—at 60,000 copies sold at the time of its deletion in 2008—as the poorest selling studio album in Linda\'s Elektra/Asylum catalogue. We Ran did not chart any singles but it was well received by critics.\r\n\r\nDespite the lack of success of We Ran, Ronstadt kept towards this adult rock exploration. She released Western Wall — The Tucson Sessions in the summer of 1999—a folk-rock oriented project with EmmyLou Harris. It earned a Grammy nomination for Best Contemporary Folk Album, and made the Top 10 of Billboard\'s Country Albums chart (#73 on the main Billboard album chart). However, it would sell roughly half the number of copies that Trio II sold and had gone out of print as of December 2010.\r\n\r\nAlso in 1999, Ronstadt went back to her concert roots, when she performed with the Eagles and Jackson Browne at Staples Center\'s 1999 New Year\'s Eve celebration kicking off the December 31 end-of-the-millennium festivities. As Staples Center Senior Vice President and General Manager Bobby Goldwater said, \"It was our goal to present a spectacular event as a sendoff to the 20th century\", and \"Eagles, Jackson Browne, and Linda Ronstadt are three of the most popular acts of the century. Their performances will constitute a singular and historic night of entertainment for New Year\'s Eve in Los Angeles.\"\r\n\r\nIn 2000 Linda Ronstadt completed her long contractual relationship with the Elektra/Asylum Records label. The fulfillment of this contract commenced with the release of A Merry Little Christmas, Linda\'s first holiday collection, which included rare choral works, the somber Joni Mitchell song \"River\", and a rare recorded duet with the late Rosemary Clooney on her (Clooney\'s) signature song, \"White Christmas\". Since leaving Warner Music, Ronstadt has gone on to release one album each under the Verve and Vanguard Record labels.\r\n\r\n\"Your musical soul is like facets of a jewel, and you stick out one facet at a time ... (and) I tend to work real hard on whatever it is I do, to get it up to speed, up to a professional level. I tend to bury myself in one thing for years at a time.\"\r\n\r\nIn 2006, recording as the ZoZo Sisters, Ronstadt teamed with her then-new friend, musician and musical scholar Ann Savoy, to record Adieu False Heart. It was an album of roots music incorporating pop, Cajun, and early 20th century music and released on the Vanguard Records label. But Adieu False Heart was a commercial failure, peaking at #146 in the U.S., and turned out to be the final new Linda Ronstadt album.\r\n\r\nAdieu False Heart, recorded in Louisiana, features a cast of local musicians, including Chas Justus, Eric Frey and Kevin Wimmer of the Red Stick Ramblers, Sam Broussard of The Mamou Playboys, Dirk Powell and Joel Savoy, as well as an array of Nashville musicians: fiddler Stuart Duncan, mandolinist Sam Bush and guitarist Bryan Sutton. The recording earned two Grammy nominations: Best Traditional Folk Album and Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Ronstadt could be heard on the compilation LP We All Love Ella: Celebrating the First Lady of Song--a tribute album to jazz music\'s all-time most heralded artist—on the track \"Miss Otis Regrets.\"[109] In the summer of 2007 Ronstadt headlined the Newport Folk Festival, making her debut at this prestigious event, where she incorporated jazz, rock and folk music into her repertoire.\r\n[edit] Selected list of career achievements\r\n\r\nAs of 2015, Linda Ronstadt has earned three #1 Pop albums, ten Top 10 Pop albums and 36 charting Pop albums on the Billboard Pop Album Charts. On Billboard (magazine)\'s Top Country Albums chart, she has charted 15 albums including ten Top 10s and four that hit #1.\r\n    \r\nAlso—as of 2015—Ronstadt\'s singles have earned her a #1 hit and three #2 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 (with ten Top 10 Pop singles and twenty-one reaching the \'Top 40\' overall). Additionally she has scored two #1 hits on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, and two #1 hits and on Billboard\'s Adult Contemporary chart.\r\n\r\nLinda has recorded and released well over 30 studio albums and has made guest appearances on an estimated 120 other albums. Her guest appearances included the classical minimalist Philip Glass\'s album Songs from Liquid Days, a hit Classical record with other major Pop stars either singing or writing lyrics, she also appeared on Glass\'s follow up recording; 1000 Airplanes on the Roof, an appearance on Paul Simon\'s Graceland, she voiced herself in The Simpsons episode \"Mr. Plow\" and sang a duet \"Funny How Time Slips Away\" with Homer Simpson on The Yellow Album. Ronstadt has also recorded on albums with artists as diverse as Billy Eckstine, Emmylou Harris, The Chieftains, Dolly Parton, Neil Young, J. D. Souther, Gram Parsons, Bette Midler, Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, Earl Scruggs, The Eagles, Andrew Gold, Hoyt Axton, Kate and Anna McGarrigle, Mark Goldenberg, Ann Savoy, Karla Bonoff, James Taylor, Warren Zevon, Maria Muldaur, Randy Newman, Nicolette Larson, the Seldom Scene, Rosemary Clooney, Aaron Neville, Rodney Crowell, Hearts and Flowers, Teresa, Laurie Lewis, Yanka Runpika and Flaco Jiménez.\r\n\r\n    Linda\'s three biggest-selling studio albums to date are her 1977 release Simple Dreams, 1983\'s What\'s New, and 1989\'s Cry Like A Rainstorm, Howl Like The Wind, each one certified by the Recording Industry Association of America for over 3 million copies sold. Her highest-selling album to date is the 1976 compilation, Greatest Hits, certified for over 7 million units sold in 2001.\r\n    Linda Ronstadt became music\'s first major touring female artist, selling out major venues, and she also became the top-grossing solo female concert artist for the 1970s. Ronstadt remained a highly successful touring artist into the 1990s at which time she decided to \'scale back\' to smaller venues.\r\n    Cash Box magazine—fierce competition to Billboard in the 1970s—named Linda Ronstadt the \'#1 Female Artist of the Decade\'.\r\n\r\n    Linda\'s RIAA certifications (audits paid for by record companies or artist for promotion) tally (as of 2001),  totals 19 Gold, 14 Platinum and 7 Multi-Platinum albums.\r\n    Ronstadt\'s album sales have not been certified since 2001, and at the time, Ronstadt\'s U.S. album sales were certified by the RIAA at well over 30 million albums sold while Peter Asher, her former producer and manager, placed her total U.S. album sales at over 45 million. Likewise, her worldwide albums sales are in excess of 100 million albums sold.\r\n\r\n    She was the first female in music history to score three Platinum albums and ultimately racked up a total of eight consecutive platinum albums between 1974 and 1980.\r\n\r\n    Her album Living In The USA is the first album by any recording act in U.S. music history to ship Double Platinum (over 2 million advanced copies).\r\n\r\n    Linda\'s first Latin release, the all-Spanish 1987 album, Canciones De Mi Padre stands as the best-selling non-English-language album in U.S. music history. As of 2015, it had sold over 2½ million U.S. copies.  Global sales are estimated to be as high as 9 million.\r\n\r\n    Ronstadt has served as record producer on various albums from musicians such as her cousin David Lindley and Aaron Neville to singer-songwriter Jimmy Webb. She produced Cristal — Glass Music Through the Ages, an album of classical music using glass instruments with Dennis James, and Ronstadt singing on several of the arrangements. In 1999, Ronstadt also produced the Gold-certified, Grammy Award-winning Trio Two album.\r\n\r\n    Linda Ronstadt has received a total of 27 Grammy Award nominations in various fields including Rock, Country, Pop, Tropical Latin, Contemporary Folk, Mexican-American, and Children\'s.  She has won 11 competitive Grammy Awards and was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Grammy in 2011.\r\n\r\n    Ronstadt was the first female solo artist to have two Top 40 singles simultaneously on Billboard magazine\'s Hot 100: \"Blue Bayou\" and \"It\'s So Easy\" (October 1977). By December, both \"Blue Bayou\" and \"It\'s So Easy\" had climbed into Billboard\'s Top 5 and remained there for the entire month.\r\n\r\n    As a singer-songwriter Ronstadt has also written songs covered by several artists, such as \"Try Me Again\" covered by Trisha Yearwood and \"Winter Light\" which was co-written and composed with Zbigniew Preisner and Eric Kaz, and covered by Sarah Brightman.\r\n\r\n    Ronstadt has elected to sing songs written by a diverse group of artist including Lowell George, Zevon, Costello, Souther, Newman, Patty Griffin. Sinéad O\'Connor, Julie Miller, Mel Tillis, Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers, John Hiatt, Joe Melson, Seldom Scene, Bruce Springsteen, George Jones, Tracy Nelson, the Flying Burrito Brothers, Little Feat, Neil Young, Bob Dylan, Chuck Berry, the Everly Brothers, Brian Wilson, the Rolling Stones, the Miracles, Oscar Hammerstein II, Roy Orbison and Buddy Holly and the Crickets.\r\n\r\n    Rolling Stone Magazine writes, a whole generation \"but for her, might never have heard the work of Buddy Holly, Chuck Berry, or Elvis Costello.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Rolling Stone\'s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\" included Heart Like A Wheel (1974) at #164 and The Very Best Of Linda Ronstadt (2002) at #324.\r\n\r\n    In 1999, Ronstadt ranked #21 in VH1\'s 100 Greatest Women of Rock & Roll. Three years later, she ranked #40 in CMT\'s 40 Greatest Women in Country Music.\r\n\r\n   Linda was diagnosed with Parkinson\'s Disease in December of 2012.   She released her best-selling autobiography, \'Simple Dreams - A Musical Memior\', in 2013.  It debuted in the Top 10 of The New York Times Best Sellers List.   In 2014, she was inducted into The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.  That same year, Ronstadt was awarded The National Medal of Arts from US President Barack Obama.\r\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Linda+Ronstadt\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Exploring growth, change and her personal and musical journey so far, it proves Heraclitus was right; you never step in the same river twice.\r\n\r\n“Its title comes from the opening track, “up, up, and away we go”! My excitement levels had hit the roof! I felt like I was flying!” Σtella declares. For a Greek-born, English-singing songwriter, Σtella’s prospects for a viable long-term career within her home country’s traditional landscape once appeared slim, but she remained positive. “I was happy doing what I love; making music I’ve listened to my whole life,” she says. Now, Σtella’s Sub Pop debut Up and Away emerges from Athens and London after a long-haul recording session with London-based producer Redinho, that found her rediscovering the 50s and 60s record collection her parents raised her on. “Growing up I loved playing ‘Sousourada’ by Nikos Gounaris on my grandfather’s old gramophone. I was thrilled by Greek folk-pop artists like Grigoris Bithikotsis and the great Tzeni Vanou, as well as international artists like Tony Motolla and Julio Inglesias, ” she remembers, among other sounds; “Living in a close-knit community by the mountains and sea, I vaguely recall being woken by neighbouring shepherds’ sheep bells…everything back then was so pure and innocent!”\r\n\r\nWhilst painting at Athens School of Fine Arts, Σtella began writing and uploading her songs into the wild of the Internet. Her debut EP Keep Me Naked riffed on the free spirit of the American and Greek mid-century pop she discovered in record stores as a teen; from I’m Your Baby Tonight era Whitney and NOW compilations, to The Doors and pop prowess of Fleetwood Mac, Kate Bush, Queen, Annie Lennox, and George Michael. Founding member of bands Fever Kids and CHEST, Σtella’s primitive synth-based numbers etched out her place. Releasing self-titled 2015 electro-pop debut Σtella and her 2017 LP Works For You, buzz and airplay beckoned, making her one of Greece’s most popular indie stars. Σtella is now a sought-after collaborator, writing, and singing for Greek underground artists – not to mention soundtracking the athletes’ parade at the first European Games in Azerbaijan, racking up a million Spotify streams, plus international festival appearances.\r\n\r\nWalking or cycling around Kypseli’s lively neighbourhood, you will find Σtella perusing the market, checking out the hardware store tools on her beloved Athinas Street, or making music in her HAVABANANA studio. Joining forces with artist and producer Tom Calvert (aka Redinho) was a match made in Athens after he caught one of her gigs on a visit to the city. Up and Away took shape after their mutual appreciation for Khruangbin, Elias Rahbani, and Aris San gradually inspired them to capture the authentic sound of Σtella’s home country. The rest, as they say, is Ancient history. “I’d been listening to old Greek folk/pop songs and was ready to dive into new musical territories. Tom had a similar desire of creating a vintage sound. Instantly stars aligned; I was time-travelling, singing songs as The Chiffons or The Crystals would.”\r\n\r\nEver the storyteller bridging past with present, Σtella designed herself and Tom as medieval bards on Up and Away’s artwork, inspired by medieval woodcuts of musicians.\r\n\r\n“There were one or two interesting things going on in my life, but we won’t be going into those…, I was in a very emotional state at the time,” she says.\r\n\r\nFollowing recent self-produced LP, The Break (released on Montreal’s Arbutus Records - Grimes, Majical Cloudz, Doldrums), Up and Away is a record of two halves moving between an all-consuming affair and deeper love. Σtella’s honeyed vocals are offset by dizzying blasts of Christos Skondras’ bouzouki improvisation and Sofia Labropoulou’s dreamy kanun, whilst vintage drums and bass are particularly foreboding on ‘Another Nation’ which has all the bravado and confidence of an artist who is happy to be stepping out. With a dewy whistle, “Titanic” describes a journey to the unknown and recites names (John Borie, Laura Mae) from a list of survivors of the sunken ship, before ‘The Truth Is’ leaps forward to acceptance (“alright, but still I miss you every night.”), ‘Who Cares’ topples into a boozy coping mechanism (“in a bottle we all fell”), and closes with the reflective ‘Is It Over.’\r\n\r\nLike a rarity unearthed, Up and Away captures the conflicting emotions of love as it lives on in ways beyond our understanding or control. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/%CE%A3tella\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Under her birth name, she released her solo debut studio album, Jukebox, in December 2009 through Capitol Records. She then spent the following decade co-writing songs for other artists, including the hit singles \"California King Bed\" for Rihanna, \"Worth It\" for Fifth Harmony, \"Love So Soft\" for Kelly Clarkson, \"Imagine\" for Ariana Grande, and the global chart-topping hit \"Timber\" for Pitbull featuring Kesha.\r\n\r\nReturning to her recording career in 2018, she independently released her second studio album, Coloured in June of that year, which saw Hamilton exploring Americana and country soul genres. After adopting the stage name Muni Long,[3] she saw further recording success with her 2022 single \"Hrs and Hrs\", which reached the top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100; prompting a recording contract with Def Jam Recordings. The song also received a Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance, and was included on her third album Public Displays of Affection: The Album (2022).\r\n\r\nShe has received three other Grammy Award nominations throughout her career, including for Best New Artist, Best R&B Song (\"Hrs & Hrs\"), and a nomination for Album of the Year through her work on Back of My Mind (2021) by H.E.R.\r\n\r\n“Muni Long is the part of me that I always needed. She’s the protector of Priscilla,” Long tells Vogue. “I knew I wanted to focus on me. I’ve been serving others for the last 12 years, and I started to feel unappreciated and captive.” During her songwriting days, the singer was diagnosed with lupus, and she says having the disease ignited an even bigger desire in her to revive her solo work. “It really put things into perspective,” Long says. “I was like, ‘If I die, I will be so pissed, having never gone after the things that I wanted.’ That\'s really what set it off.” By the end of the year, Long will release her first EP as Muni Long—under Supergiant Records, her own label—that she wrote before COVID-19. She’s already rolled out two singles and music videos from it, both of which reflect her new strong, fabulous persona through fashion while working with celebrity stylist Jason Rembert to cultivate a bold new look. (He also styles Issa Rae, Mary J. Blige, and more). “Since Jason has come along, I love how powerful and beautiful I look,” says Long. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Muni+Long\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

His music is a mix of country, bluegrass and folk. He released his breakthrough album Purgatory in August 2017. Childers released his third and most recent LP, Country Squire, via his own Hickman Holler Records, under exclusive license to RCA Records in August 2019. \r\n\r\nTyler Childers was born and raised in Lawrence County, Kentucky. His father worked in the coal industry and his mother is a nurse. He learned singing in church where he sang in the church choir. He started to play guitar and write songs when he was around 13. He moved from Lawrence County to Paintsville, Kentucky, where he attended Paintsville High School and graduated in 2009. Fellow country musicians Chris Stapleton and Loretta Lynn (Van Lear, KY) also hail from Paintsville. He studied for a semester at Western Kentucky University, and enrolled at Bluegrass Community and Technical College for a few semesters. He dropped out of college and did odd jobs for some time while pursuing a music career.\r\n\r\nChilders began performing in Lexington, Kentucky and Huntington, West Virginia. In 2011, when he was 19, Childers released his first album, Bottles And Bibles. He has also released two EPs recorded in 2013 at Red Barn Radio, a radio show from Lexington. The two EPs were later released as one after the success of his album Purgatory, and reached No. 5 on Heatseekers Albums.\r\n\r\nHe had his first success with Purgatory, a breakthrough album released on August 4, 2017. The album was produced by Sturgill Simpson and David Ferguson and recorded at The Butcher Shoppe in Nashville. Simpson also played guitar and sang backing vocals on the album, with Miles Miller on drums, Stuart Duncan on fiddle and Russ Paul on other instruments. It debuted at No. 1 on Billboard\'s Heatseekers Albums chart, No. 17 on the Country albums chart and No. 4 on the Americana/Folk albums chart. In September 2018, Childers won Emerging Artist of the Year at the 2018 Americana Music Honors & Awards, where he gave an acceptance speech noted for its criticism of the Americana genre label, saying that \"as a man who identifies as a country music singer, I feel Americana ain\'t no part of nothing and is a distraction from the issues that we\'re facing on a bigger level as country music singers. It kind of feels like purgatory.\"\r\n\r\nCountry Squire, a second album under the Hickman Holler label, and Childers\' third overall, was released on August 2, 2019, after being announced in May 2019. This album was again produced by Simpson and Ferguson. The video of the lead single from the album \"House Fire\" was also released on May 16, 2019.\r\n\r\nChilders\' music is influenced by his home state of Kentucky and its connection to country music and bluegrass. He often writes about coal mining, which was his father\'s occupation, and its effects. Rebecca Bengal, writing for The Guardian, described Childers\' songs as a \"counternarrative to the outsiders who seek to perpetuate stereotypes of backwardness and poverty.\" Childers emphasizes lyrical content in songs, comparing the songwriting process to telling short stories. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Tyler+Childers\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The EP\'s four tracks were recorded at their spritual home, a remote barn deep in the Texas countryside where Khruangbin\'s first rehearsals took place.

Both professional musicians, Mark began teaching Laura how to play bass in the summer of 2009. As such, Laura quickly developed a huge passion for the instrument and the aesthetic it brought to music she loved. Having worked studiously on developing her skills, both Mark and Laura were invited to tour with Ninja Tune\'s YPPAH supporting Bonobo across his 2010 American tour.

He first got started in music after learning the guitar in high school and started writing music around the age of 17. Known for his work as a chiptune artist, Vreeland stepped into film score composition with the 2015 film It Follows.\r\n\r\nVreeland\'s first introduction to music was as a child, growing up in Staten Island. He spent a great deal of time learning from his step-father, who was a trained musician. In an interview, Vreeland stated, \"As a child, I was mesmerized by drums. My step-father was the music director of our church and they would have band practice in the basement. Many of my fondest memories are of going down there to jam away on the drums, when they were there\".\r\n\r\nVreeland composed Fez\'s chiptune-esque electronic soundtrack. Despite his background in chiptune, Vreeland limited his use of that genre\'s mannerisms in the score. He worked with soft synth pads and reverb to push the score closer to an \'80s synthesizer sound. He also reduced reliance on percussion and incorporated distortion techniques like bitcrushing and wow. Vreeland opted for slower passages with varying tempos that could \"ebb, flow, and breathe with the player\". He left some portions of Fez without music. Vreeland worked on its soundtrack at night for about 14 months while scoring Shoot Many Robots, and Brandon McCartin of Aquaria contributed the game\'s sound effects.\r\n\r\nIn 2014, Vreeland produced the soundtrack for David Robert Mitchell\'s sophomore film It Follows, after being approached by Mitchell, a fan of Vreeland\'s work on the video game Fez.\r\n\r\nDisasterpeace composed the soundtrack for Hyper Light Drifter, a game developed by Heart Machine in 2016. The score follows Disasterpeace\'s previous soundtrack work and was listed as \"One of the year\'s best scores, in any medium\" by FACT. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Disasterpeace\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Their sound is usually described as electropop mixed with new wave and shoegaze influences. \r\n\r\nLiverpool-based producers and DJs Daniel Hunt and Reuben Wu met in the 1990s. Hunt was the founder of the indie record label Invicta Hi-Fi and of a nightclub. Wu trained in Industrial Design at Sheffield Hallam University and graduated in 1997. He became an industrial designer at Team Consulting Limited until 2002.\r\n\r\nUsing the moniker Ladytron, taken from the song \"Ladytron\" by Roxy Music, Hunt and Wu recorded the debut single \"He Took Her to a Movie\" with the guest vocalist Lisa Eriksson (who later formed the band Techno Squirrels). \"He Took Her to a Movie\" was released in July 1999 and gained positive reviews. \r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1999, Hunt and Wu met Helen Marnie (born in 1978 in Glasgow, Scotland) and Mira Aroyo (born in 1977 in Sofia, Bulgaria). Marnie and Aroyo joined Ladytron as vocalists and keyboard players. Marnie studied music at the University of Liverpool where she received a Bachelor of Arts in pop music in 1999.

Until 2004, the band wore uniforms on stage. Daniel Hunt stated in 2001 that their uniforms were inspired by the SF movie The Andromeda Strain. In an interview from 2002, Hunt also said that the meaning of 604 album title is the area code for British Columbia.\r\n\r\nIn 17 September 2002, Ladytron released their sophomore album Light & Magic at Emperor Norton (US) and Telstar (UK). The album was also released in 7 April 2003 at Warner Music (Germany) and in 21 June 2003 at Victor Entertainment (Japan).

They toured over a year to support this album.\r\n\r\nIn 7 October 2003, they issued the mix compilation Softcore Jukebox on Emperor Norton. The compilation includes songs of other artists selected by the band and also two of their own songs: the single remix of \"Blue Jeans\" renamed \"Blue Jeans 2.0\" and the cover \"Oops Oh My\" by Tweet.

The album featured live drums and guitars mixed with their trademark sound. This album was very well received by critics and fans. It was supported by the singles \"Sugar\" and \"Destroy Everything You Touch\". The single \"Destroy Everything You Touch\" became the band\'s signature song.\r\n\r\nTheir third album was followed in 2006 by Extended Play, a two-disc EP CD/DVD compilation that features exclusive unreleased remixes and UK B-sides, as well as a 35-minute bonus DVD that included a 27 minutes documentary titled Once Upon a Time in the East: Ladytron in China based on their short 2004 tour in China. In the same year Ladytron recorded The Harmonium Sessions, which contained four reworked songs from Witching Hour.\r\n\r\nWithout any real label support, Ladytron toured exhaustively over the next two years, on the strength of their cult following. They played in North America, Europe, and South America. They also opened for Nine Inch Nails in early 2007 at the request of Trent Reznor.\r\n\r\nAlong their career, Ladytron have produced remixes for many artists, including Dave Gahan, Goldfrapp, Placebo, Blondie, Bloc Party, Kings of Convenience, Gang of Four, She Wants Revenge, Soulwax, Nine Inch Nails, Simian, Indochine and Apoptygma Berzerk.\r\n\r\nIn 2 June 2008, the group issued on Nettwerk their fourth album, Velocifero. The album was recorded in Paris, with the band handling production duties with Alessandro Cortini (Modwheelmood, Nine Inch Nails, SONOIO) and Vicarious Bliss (Justice, DJ Mehdi). Their sound evolved to an even more organic sound and harsher beats. The band states that \"velocifero\" literally means \"bringer of speed\" and is also the name of a classic retro styled scooter. The album spawned three singles, \"Ghosts\", \"Runaway\" and \"Tomorrow\".\r\n\r\nIn 6 April 2009, Nettwerk issued the remix compilation Velocifero (Remixed & Rare).

The album was recorded in Kent\'s countryside and it was produced by the band and Barny Barnicott (Arctic Monkeys, Kasabian, Editors). Daniel Hunt said \"Gravity the Seducer is more of a jump than the last album was, more ethereal and melodic, a touch more abstract in places than we\'ve gone before, baroque \'n\' roll\".\r\n\r\nGravity the Seducer has been preceded by the single \"White Elephant\", issued on 17 May 2011. The band premiered the song \"Ambulances\", in 16 June 2011.

In that year, RKS independently released their first album \"Seven\" (Which was later re-released in combination with the band\'s first EP as a joint album titled \"Seven + Mary\"). The title song, \"Seven\" has been featured in many places on the web including in the very popular podcast by IGN, Podcast Beyond!

Opening one\'s eyes again after trauma, loss, or a lost love. Lissom’s Eclipses brings to life these experiences. After a first eponymous record characterized by its romanticism and delicacy (2018, Whales Records), the duo composed of pianist, composer, and producer Julien Marchal and British songwriter and producer Lowswimmer (Ed Tullett) returns with Eclipses, a refined and poetic play of light. The two composers, separated by the sea and the past years’ confinements, worked remotely, exchanging their contributions via Ableton Live (a music creation software). This process brought a unique emotion and warmth to their masterful assets, imparting the feeling that the singer\'s falsetto and the Frenchman\'s minimalist piano longed to find each other and embrace. Separation anxiety impregnates the record: the loneliness that comes with it, but also the luminous hope of rebirth and the resumption of a former life. Here, the memory of the other is often painful, but also a source of comfort. Love betrays and hurts, but constitutes, by the trace it leaves and the promise it carries. ‘Eclipses’ is a more transparent and airy record than Lissom’s eponymous debut; simpler and perhaps even more moving.

The band consists of brothers Ben and Alex Morrison, who play guitar and banjo respectively, along with Gio Benedetti on the bass, Philip Brezina with the violin, and Ryan Avellone on the Mandolin.\r\n\r\nBen Morrison and Alex Morrison are brothers. They have been making music together from birth. Ben\'s first word was \'front-man\' and Alex\'s was \'moustache\' (see band photo). Joe Pacini and Gio Benedetti met Ben and Alex in high school. They shared many a living room jam session, many a raucous music party, many a front-stoop hoedown, but there was no band.\r\n\r\nAfter years of studying, vision quests in far off lands, moving about, relocating, and the occasional intermittent music party, the young and now much hairier fellows found themselves in San Francisco with Alex, Ben and Joe living in a vibe-steeped flat on Haight Street, playing music (Ben on guitar, Alex on Banjo - both of them singing - and Joe on mandolin and cigarette breaks) at parties and open mics across the fair city. They needed a bassist. Gio happened to be a bassist. He also happened to live nearby.\r\n\r\nThe, now, quartet continued their tradition of stoop-and-living-room-esque performances, but moved them public. The dive bars of San Francisco became inspired, momentary homes, as friends, fans and music lovers rallied around the snug honesty of the band\'s barroom shows. All they lacked was a brilliant fiddler with tremendous soloing skills, and with feet and soul firmly planted in the legacy of Old-Time, Bluegrass musics. Oh where, oh where could such a person be?\r\n\r\nPhilip Brezina - graduate student in classical violin at the nearby Conservatory and recent transplant from Pennsylvania - knew good roots music, knew how to play it and, best of all, knew how to play it on the fiddle. He wandered into the quartet (answering an ad posted in the Conservatory halls), and the long lost Brother Comatose was found.\r\n\r\nDoors began opening. Performances at such legendary places as San Francisco\'s Fillmore Poster Room, the Great American Music Hall, and the Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival followed, supporting such acts as The Devil Makes Three, Justin Townes Earl, Hillstomp, Greensky Bluegrass, John Doe and the Sadies, Yonder Mountain String Band and others.\r\n\r\nNow touring in support of their recent debut full-length, Songs From The Stoop, The Brothers Comatose aim at converting the entire West Coast into their Living Room Music Party. Their shows exude a foot-stomping, shout-along, drink-along ease that was once a staple in every music-playing, front-stoop-possessing home in the land.

His first, self-penned single, \"Colourblind\", entered the UK singles chart at number one, and his debut album went platinum under the guidance of Grammy-winning U2 producer Steve Lillywhite. Darius has had five UK Top Ten singles and he is managed by Simon Fuller. In 2006 he ended a second successful West End run in the musical Chicago playing Billy Flynn, and 2007 will see him star as Sky Masterson in the musical Guys and Dolls.\r\n\r\nDarius\' professional career began playing a ten-year-old Trojan boy in the Scottish Opera\'s avante garde 1990s production of The Trojans. As a teenager he then toured with the Scottish Opera in a critically acclaimed production of Carmen. After performing at the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden, Darius faced the first of many career cross-roads. He chose to return to his studies in lieu of training his rich baritone voice for an Operatic career.\r\n\r\nWhile studying English Literature at Edinburgh University, a chance audition and promise of a record deal led Darius to fame on the television show Popstars. After reaching the final stages, Darius went on to audition for the show that was in a sense its successor, Pop Idol. He got through to the final rounds of Pop Idol, ultimately placing third. However, he turned down Simon Cowell\'s million pound offer to sing cover songs,[3] and instead sent a self-composed track to his favourite producer in the hope of creating something original. Grammy-winning U2 producer Steve Lillywhite signed him to a five-album deal. In the summer of 2002, \"Colourblind\" became Darius\' first number one single and that Christmas, his self-penned album \"Dive In\" went platinum.\r\n\r\nOver the next two years, Darius would go on to support Shakira in Paris on her World Tour; complete his own sell-out UK tour; become an Ambassador for the Prince\'s Trust; contribute to the War Child charity album[5] with Coldplay and Oasis; write a no. 6 Sunday Times Best Seller book, \"Sink or Swim\"; and headline in India with Alanis Morissette after his album went platinum there.\r\n\r\nAfter receiving news that his father was diagnosed with terminal cancer, Darius wrote and dedicated his second studio album to Dr Booth Danesh, the man he calls his \"hero\". In 2005, the album\'s title track \"Live Twice\" became Darius\' fifth Top Ten single. Amazingly, father Booth not only lived to see his son perform it at the Royal Albert Hall, but fought and beat his cancer into remission, echoing the song\'s lyrics.\r\n\r\nDuring 2006 and 2007 he composed for his third album in Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nCampbell Danesh was found unresponsive on 11 August 2022 in his apartment in Rochester, Minnesota, United States, and he was pronounced dead later that day.

The band\'s lineup is variable, with singer-songwriter Evan Stephens Hall and drummer Zack Levine representing its core members. The two met as children and played in various bands before founding Pinegrove. The band\'s musical style, which uses instruments such as the banjo and pedal steel guitar, is commonly described as a mix between alt-country and emo. Pinegrove\'s early years were spent self-releasing music—including their debut album, Meridian—and performing do-it-yourself (DIY) house shows.\r\n\r\nAfter signing to the independent record label Run for Cover, the group issued an anthology of their early work, titled Everything So Far. Their second studio album, Cardinal, represented a breakthrough, gathering a devoted fan listenership and appearing on many music critics\' top-10 year-end lists. After recording its successor, Skylight, Pinegrove took a year-long hiatus after Hall was accused of sexual coercion by a person with whom he toured. The album saw proper release independently in 2018 and was followed by several sold-out tours. The band signed to British label Rough Trade for their next efforts, including Marigold and 11:11.\r\n\r\nPinegrove is known for their literary lyricism and loyal following of fans, which refer to themselves as \"Pinenuts\". The band\'s name comes from a prominent pine tree row on a nature reserve at Kenyon College, where Hall attended college. They are known for their geometric iconography, specifically using square shapes and usage of the ampersand (&) in artwork and merchandise. Pinegrove is also recognized for their alignment with progressive causes, including charitable contributions to civil rights organizations.\r\n\r\nPinegrove\'s sound has frequently been referred to as a mix between alt-country, an offshoot of modern country music, and emo, a rock genre characterized by an emphasis on emotional expression. The group has toured with acts commonly labeled emo, such as The World Is a Beautiful Place & I Am No Longer Afraid to Die, while the original label RFC is known for its association with fourth-wave emo bands. Pelly of Pitchfork notes \"this affiliation makes sense: Their music is open-hearted, communal, earnest, lyrical, with a discernible ease.\" Cardinal\'s success led tastemakers to include Pinegrove among a wave of \"emo revival\" acts, and while Hall stopped short of labeling the group, he acknowledged his work could be \"lyrically confessional, emotionally direct, and emotive vocally, frequently.\" In response, Hall clarified the band\'s mission: \"emo points inwards and it\'s our aim to point outwards.\" The group also has been categorized as indie rock, math rock, and Americana; Hall himself once described the band as the \"midpoint between math rock and Americana.\"\r\n\r\nMusically, Pinegrove augments the standard guitar/drums/bass lineup with instruments such as banjo and pedal steel guitar. The group\'s style has been compared to fusion genre fore-bearers the Weakerthans, as well as Wilco, Built to Spill, \"Gillian Welch, and early Death Cab for Cutie.\" Hall has listed My Morning Jacket and Bon Iver among the band\'s more direct musical influences; an early profile of the band narrativizes Hall and Levine\'s love of My Morning Jacket\'s live album Okonokos as the catalyst for starting their music careers. For Hall as a songwriter, his influences are split between music and literature; he has cited artists such as Stephen Steinbrink and Phil Elverum as inspirations, as well as writers George Saunders, William Faulkner, and Virginia Woolf. To this end, Hall has referred to Pinegrove as \"language-arts rock.\"\r\n\r\nhttp://pinegrove.bandcamp.com/ <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Pinegrove\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Like so many electronic artists in the mid-’10s, New Zealand’s BAYNK (Jock Nowell-Usticke) got his start making chill, pop-adjacent songs that seemed primed for placement in mood-based playlists. His early attempts at surf-bro EDM sounded like what Kygo and LeMarquis were putting out on SoundCloud at the time; he used his voice sparingly, mainly as material to be sampled. In the years since, though, he has refined his palette. On 2017’s Someone’s EP I and 2019’s Someone’s EP II, his percussion took on the rhythmic impulse of Four Tet, and his rubbery basslines and glossy experimentalism were reminiscent of early Cashmere Cat and Flume. Using his Auto-Tuned falsetto to further texturize his songs, BAYNK’s fusion of house, R&B, and pop soon set him apart from the many similar acts scattered throughout the scene.\r\n\r\nAdolescence is BAYNK’s most meticulous work to date. It revels in eccentric, distinctive details while adhering to traditional pop structures. Most arrangements consist of grainy synth loops, plucky subs, and house-inspired drums; his digital sounds are drenched in reverb and slapped with sidechain. On the Cosmo’s Midnight-assisted “How Does it Feel?” languid synth pulses and a funky bassline give way to some of the sharpest vocal melodies on the album. “Remember,” which features Rainsford, exhibits BAYNK’s talent for peeling a heavily layered song back to its component parts before climaxing into an ecstatic yet graceful drop. This is dance music for headphones, club music for late-night walks.\r\n\r\nThe best songs on Adolescence bend toward straightforward pop formulas and, tellingly, include non-electronic instruments. “Mine” is led by quiet piano and spacey guitar, while standout “Naked” blends acoustic elements and electric bass with shimmering synths. BAYNK gives his best vocal performances here: “Get caught up on trying to pin you down/Your fingers ’round my neck, they’re feeling soft now,\" he coos on “Naked,” evoking the warm upper register of Whitney’s Julien Ehrlich. He’s not a great singer, as Tinashe makes plain when she steals the show on “Esther”; he scrubs clean his imperfections with layers of automation, delay, and reverb. Still, BAYNK has a keen ear for melody and knows his limits, wisely ceding the mic to guests while he works the boards.\r\n\r\nThe album is nominally a concept record about the immediacy of youth and romantic first experiences. “I went through this period of not being able to write anything,” BAYNK told Apple Music. Being in a “stable and happy relationship” wasn’t conducive to inspiration, so to get around his writer’s block, he returned to the creative cocoon of “first love.” Lyrically, the album is imagistic and vague, depicting half-baked scenes of lying in the sun, holding hands in a car, and walking through fields. The narrative never coalesces into anything meaningful, and its emotional pull wanes quickly. First love invigorates but rarely sustains; it’s BAYNK’s elastic and original production that propels the album forward, the pulse of the beat begging us to feel something beyond recognition. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/BAYNK\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

All of the songs off of Blackwhite were released as singles before the release of the EP.\r\nIn 2019, Mesita would release their 7th Album Eat Ass or Die Trying.

After graduating from Boston’s Berklee School of Music, the two young friends and collaborators moved into an old Victorian house in Brooklyn’s Ditmas Park – a former recording studio and music school.

Taking a cue from their San Francisco roots and greats like Norman Whitfield, George Clinton\'s Funkadelic, David Axelrod, and Sly Stone, the group has found their path which has taken on a direction that focuses on great tones using analog equipment, a simpler and more spontaneous songwriting approach and trying to always catch a vibe that brings back thoughts of the 1969 psychedelic movement! <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Monophonics\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

He grew up in a small French village outside of Tours, isolated from his friends, and so he turned to music for company. He got hooked on his parents’ records by Pink Floyd, Billie Holliday, Nina Simone and Queen, and took up guitar; then, aged seven, the saxophone. “I would play with whatever toys were around, and that helped develop my imagination, and then that evolved into making instruments – I found whatever I could and started putting it together,” he said of his rudimentary one-man bands. \r\n\r\nThat one-man-band mentality has persisted, collecting instruments as he goes, though he’s never been formally trained; instead developing his own ear. Prestigious music colleges were too expensive and so he eventually moved to Paris to study the sound and film, which helped give him grounding in cinematic arrangements. He fell into the city’s nightlife scene, playing live instruments in clubs in Paris, and became known as a Soundcloud producer who blended house and jazz, as on his vibey 2013 Time For A Change EP. \r\n\r\nBut then in 2015, he played a festival in the Philippines that changed everything. There he met June, who performs as ((( O )))) and who he’d remixed a track for. Eventually they got married and moved in together on an island off the country’s south coast, where they have created a tropical studio idyll that looks out onto lush rainforest. You can see it in the live session FKJ recorded there in 2019 (over 19m views on YouTube), as he flits between piano, singing and sax.\r\n\r\nThe seeds for his more introspective sound were sown with his 2017 self-titled debut, while the track that he did with Masego that same year, ‘Tadow’, further evidenced his effortless ear for intriguing rhythms – the pair made the hip-hop-speared jazz jam out of a day-long improvisation in Paris, duelling on their saxophones, their keyboards and drums interlocking effortlessly. There’s an ease to his collaborations – nothing forced; artists who are like-minded about being guided by groove – see the meeting of minds on the track “Risk’ with the American rapper Bas or his latest remix for PinkPantheress. \r\n\r\nBut in 2019, FKJ started drawing more from within. He released the Ylang Ylang EP, the result of a tumultuous and devastating year when June miscarried. The couple cancelled their commitments and holed up together to recuperate and make music. The sweepingly romantic jazz of the title track is the EP’s centrepiece, encircled by crisp R&B beats, acoustic guitar flourishes and ambitious sax instrumentals on the other songs. The making of it soothed them as much as it did his growing international fanbase. “With music, I feel safe,” he says. “So when I hear that my music is healing for people, it’s the best compliment.” \r\n\r\nBack in the Philippines, with no wifi and an impending global lockdown, FKJ was quite literally cut off from the world, able to explore music’s endless possibilities. “Sometimes I would get into it for the whole night and go to bed when the sun came up.” Out of this freedom comes an expressionistic, touching album that’s impossible to pin down. There’s no more hiding behind a branch of leaves, as he did on the cover of his 2017 debut: V I N C E N T marks FKJ out as a crucial new voice. He’s redefining chillout music with his bursts of late-night jazz sax and piano, coupled with his wood-cabin whispery vocals, recalling Bon Iver’s early work, and those Santana-styled guitar flourishes. \r\n\r\nV I N C E N T is a marvel – and testament to the magic that can happen when you dig deep. “This was a challenging record,” he says. “I’m a perfectionist and it’s hard to shake that off. But once I did, and I let the music take over, I felt totally free.” <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/FKJ\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The Garden is an American post punk duo from Orange County, California, formed in 2011 by twin brothers Wyatt and Fletcher Shears. The duo released their debut album The Life and Times of a Paperclip in 2013, with several smaller releases following. In 2015, the group released their second studio album Haha along with the lead single \"All Smiles Over Here :)\" to critical acclaim after being signed to Epitaph Records. They released their third album Mirror Might Steal Your Charm on March 30, 2018. Their fourth album, Kiss My Super Bowl Ring, was released on March 13th, 2020. Their most recent album, Horseshit on Route 66, was released September 8th, 2022.\r\n\r\nThe band is known for their fast, punk-influenced two-piece bass and drum songs, with both their music and image being characterized by \"DIY principles, thrift store-cum-glam fashion style and a vast list of influences.\" The brothers classify their sound as \"vada vada,\" a philosophy which Wyatt Shears describes as “an idea that represents pure creative expression, that disregards all previously made genres and ideals”.\r\n\r\n2. The Garden was a gothic rock / ethereal wave / shoegaze band from Pittsburgh, PA, United States. The band was formed in the autumn of 1985, with the intentions of pursuing a sound that was not only unique, but also moving. And through the years, Anthony LaCava, Christine Sacramento and Stephen Marlette, with accompaniment by Shelly O\'Keefe on bells/keyboards, followed this dream by creating many songs of great substance. The band emerged with an intensely uncommon sound drawn on electronic drum tracks and dark ambient guitar mixed with rhythmic bass, heartfelt lyrics and strong vocals.\r\nOften described as \"Pittsburgh\'s first gothic rock band\", The Garden has sustained a rather faithful following. Tanya Kavalkovich joined the band in 1996 with her lyrical violin contributing a new warmth and beauty to an already compelling sound. Opening for such acts as And Also the Trees, Wolfgang Press, Throwing Muses, Faith and the Muse, Strange Boutique, Spahn Ranch, Gargoyle Sox, Of a Mesh, FourWay Cross, This Ascension. The Curtain Society, Bella Morte, Eva O.\r\nHeavy employment and academic demands forced Stephen to leave the band in 1997. Christine, Anthony, and Tanya formed a new band with drummer James and vocalist Patricia called Between the Waters\r\n\r\n3. The Garden is a collaboration between David Tagg and Hakobune. It isn’t often that collaborative projects bear such bountiful fruit right from the start of their conception, but sometimes, nature seems to have another motive in mind, and we’re given a very special and very unique result. Hailing from near-opposite sides of the globe, David Tagg and Takahiro Yorifuji (also known here at Install and elsewhere as Hakobune) decided to combine their complementary approaches to ambient guitar music and make something new together.\r\n\"In Sea-Land\" certainly conjures images of organic growth in a surreal landscape, and the album colors in the empty spaces with watery blue melodies submerged in ocean water and triumphant overarching towers of weathered stone drones surrounded by sea spray and thin clouds. Both similar to what David and Takahiro have individually created before, and also unique to itself, these two men have found an alchemical assurance in combining their crafts with The Garden. Sure to please fans of either musician’s work, or anyone who appreciates gentle guitars unspooled over a canvas of water and green. Deep and lush, alive and vibrant.

The entire album was recorded, mixed and produced by Mering herself, then mastered by good friend Graham Lambkin.

At some point in their childhood, Daniela and Paulina had selected guitar and drums as their primary instruments, respectively. When the youngest of the three, Alejandra, selected bass guitar as her primary instrument at about age 7, the sisters decided to form a rock power trio in 2013. They learned to play rock songs, often via the Rock Band video game series, and posted videos of their performances on YouTube.\r\n\r\nIn 2014, 12-year-old Paulina was profiled in the women\'s drumming publication Tom Tom Magazine. The band first gained widespread notice later in 2014 when, at ages 9 through 14, their YouTube video in which they performed Metallica\'s \"Enter Sandman\" went viral among rock music fans, eventually earning more than 20 million views. The video received attention from Metallica guitarist Kirk Hammett, who offered particular praise for Paulina, saying, \"The drummer kicks maximum ass!\"\r\n\r\nDue to notice gained from their \"Enter Sandman\" video, The Warning decided to seek a record deal and develop their songs. They raised money through a successful GoFundMe appeal to record the six-song EP Escape the Mind, which was released in 2015. During the production of the EP, the band met producer Jake Carmona, who went on to contribute to Escape the Mind and their next three albums. In April 2015, the band appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. During this period the sisters raised funds, including a donation from DeGeneres and the Target Corporation, to attend a five-week training program at Berklee College of Music in the United States.\r\n\r\nThey also gave two presentations at the TEDx conference at the University of Nevada in 2016 and 2017.[17][18] The band was known for practicing with the Rock Band video game series early in their history; designers returned the favor by including several songs by The Warning in the 2018 edition of the series.[19][20]\r\n\r\nThe Warning\'s first full-length album, XXI Century Blood, was released in 2017. During this period they were invited to perform at the Mother of All Rock Festival in Monterrey and also opened a show for The Killers in that city. Their second album Queen of the Murder Scene was released in November 2018. They announced an extensive upcoming tour throughout North America in late 2019, though it was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\r\n\r\nIn August 2020, The Warning signed a five-album deal with Lava Records, and began work on a new album with producer David Bendeth. The song \"Choke\" was released in May 2021. Later that year, The Warning appeared on the Metallica tribute album The Metallica Blacklist, performing another cover of \"Enter Sandman\", this time with singer Alessia Cara. The six-song EP Mayday was released in October 2021, and The Warning embarked on a tour of North America in early 2022, performing more than 30 dates as headliners plus opening for Foo Fighters, Sammy Hagar and the Circle, and Stone Temple Pilots. They released the single \"Money\" in March 2022, and the song reached no. 31 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Airplay chart. The full-length album Error, comprising the six tracks from the Mayday EP plus \"Money\" and seven new songs, was released in June 2022. In July 2022, they embarked on a U.S. tour supporting Halestorm and The Pretty Reckless and appearing at festivals like Burlington\'s Sound of Music Festival, Iceberg Alley, Summerfest, and Upheaval, before resuming their headlining tour in August 2022. In the Fall of 2022, The Warning performed at additional festivals (Louder Than Life, Aftershock, Peninsula Tecate, Rock al Parque), supported a second US tour with Halestorm, a Canada tour with Three Days Grace, a Guns N\' Roses tour stop in their home city of Monterrey, Mexico, and performed small-venue concerts in Las Vegas, California, and Lima, Peru. The band supported Muse during several dates on the Will of the People World Tour in both Mexico and Europe. In September 2023, they opened for Guns N\' Roses again on two dates of the We\'re F\'N\' Back! Tour. In early 2024, the band announced on social media that their fourth studio album Keep Me Fed will be released in June 2024.

Making their name with several singles and remixes, as well as EPs like 2011\'s Magic, they made their full-length debut in 2016 with 55, which featured a diverse array of guests such as Cam\'ron, Carly Rae Jepsen, Wyclef Jean, and Walk the Moon. Following side project diversions that delved into future funk (Amelia Airhorn) and tropical house (the Mary Nixons), the Knocks presented another feel-good disco-house throwback with 2019\'s New York Narcotic. The duo subsequently released projects with artists like Gallant, Rivers Cuomo, and Foster the People, with whom they recorded the covers-heavy 2021 EP Melody & Silence. The collaboration-heavy full-length outing HISTORY appeared the following year.\r\n\r\nThe Knocks were formed in 2008 by James \"JPatt\" Patterson and Ben \"DJ B-Roc\" Ruttner. Patterson and Ruttner met at New York City\'s New School and shared an apartment, where they set up small recording studios in their bedrooms. The loud noise coming from their apartment led to neighbors constantly knocking on their door in order to get them to pipe down, hence the duo\'s name. Early success as remixers, however, enabled them to build their own studio in Manhattan. During 2008 and 2009, Knocks remixes surfaced for Katy Perry (\"I Kissed a Girl\"), Britney Spears (\"3\"), and PRGz (\"Soul Glo\"). B-Roc and Andrew W.K. also released DAMN! The Mixtape Vol. 1 in 2009, featuring several Knocks productions.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, the Knocks released their first singles, the sunny \"Dancing with the DJ\" (which later appeared on their 2011 EP Magic) and the whistling \"Make It Better.\" Over the course of the next few years, the duo\'s profile was magnified by additional remixes for Tegan and Sara (\"Closer\"), the 1975 (\"Girls\"), and Dragonette (\"Let It Go\"), among others, in addition to tours with Ellie Goulding, Dragonette, and Sleigh Bells. They also collaborated with Fred Falke for the Kitsuné Music release \"Geronimo\" in 2012, as well as Treasure Fingers for \"DYWT,\" released on Fool\'s Gold Clubhouse in 2014. Also in 2014, the group released an EP, titled Comfortable and released on the Neon Gold label, that included collaborations with X Ambassadors and Ra Ra Riot.\r\n\r\nSigned to Big Beat, the Knocks slowed it down a bit for the 2014 single \"Classic,\" one of their funkier and more disco-indebted singles, featuring Powers. An EP titled So Classic appeared in April 2015, followed by a new version of \"Classic\" featuring a verse by Fetty Wap. The Knocks spent much of the year working on their long-delayed debut album, which was previewed by the singles \"I Wish (My Taylor Swift)\" (with Matthew Koma) and \"New York City\" (featuring Cam\'ron). Finally, in March 2016, the duo released their first full-length, 55, which included additional guest appearances from Wyclef Jean, Walk the Moon, Carly Rae Jepsen, Alex Newell, and Semi-Precious Weapons\' Justin Trantor. That July, the pair remixed selected tracks from the album on the 55.5 EP.\r\n\r\nIn early 2017, the Knocks released Testify, an EP of new songs featuring collaborations with MNEK, Delacey, and Tayla Parx. Later that year, the duo teamed up with Skylar Spence and released a future funk mixtape as Amelia Airhorn. They also formed the Mary Nixons, a group with Mat Zo, and issued the single \"Adrian.\" They followed with the Captain Cuts collaboration \"House Party.\" July 2018 saw the release of the single \"Shades\" which appeared later that year on the Knocks\' second full-length, New York Narcotic. The album also featured contributions from Method Man, Sofi Tukker, and Foster the People.\r\n\r\n2019 brought several singles, including the Kah-Lo collaboration \"Awa Ni\" and \"Lucky Me\" (with Great Good Fine Ok). Most of these were collected on the EP Summer Series: 2019. Several more singles arrived in 2020, including \"One Fine Day\" (with Idris Elba), \"Bodies\" (with MUNA), and \"All About You\" (featuring Foster the People). The following year, they released Melody & Silence, an EP with Foster the People that included a remix of the single, as well as covers of hits by Beck, Moby, and the Verve. Also in 2021, the Knocks released \"R U High\" (featuring Mallrat) and \"Sound the Alarm\" (featuring Rivers Cuomo and Royal & the Serpent), and were featured on Purple Disco Machine\'s \"Fireworks.\" The following year saw the release of the full-length effort, HISTORY, which featured collaborations with Foster the People, MUNA, Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs, Cold War Kids, Parson James, and Yoke Lore, among others.\r\n\r\nBiography by  Andy Kellman <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Knocks\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

But the desire to be more involved in their local churches led the band to lower the curtain in 2017.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Elias and his family had moved to Nashville writing for other artists (Newsong, Phil Joel, Big Daddy Weave, Building 429) and publications like Worship Leader Magazine and Huffington Post.

Swedish indie/folk duo which consists of sisters Johanna (b. 31 October 1990) and Klara Söderberg (b. 8 January 1993) both from Enskede, Sweden. \r\nThe sisters began composing songs in 2007, taking their name at random from an English dictionary. \r\nThey began uploading their music to their My Space page and sending their songs to Swedish radio station, this led to live performances and offers from Record Companies.\r\nTheir debut EP \"Drunken Trees\" was released on the 9th of April 2008 in Sweden on the label Rabid Records, owned by the Swedish electronic duo The Knife.The EP was produced by their father and contained a collection of songs uploaded to their My Space page including You\'re Not Coming Home Tonight and Tangerine, a song sent to Swedish the previous year.\r\nBy 2009 the sisters were well known locally, but it was when they uploaded their version of the Fleet Foxes\' song Tiger Mountain Peasant Song which caught the attention of the Fleet Foxes guitarist/vocalist Robin Pecknold and subsequently the popularity of the duo to international fame. The Drunken Trees EP was then re released not long after. \r\n\r\nTheir debut album The Big Black And The Blue was originally issued on 1 February 2010. The album contained the first single Hard Believer and the standout I Met Up With The King, possibly still one of their greatest songs and sounding very much like Neko Case\r\n\r\nAlso in 2010, they recorded a cover version of Buff Sainte-Marie\'s Universal Soldier and performed in honor of Patti Smith at the Polar Music Prize singing her classic Dancing Barefoot\r\n\r\nTheir 2nd album The Lions Roar, produced by Mike Mogis from Bright Eyes, was released on 18 January 2012.

Early the following year the album won \"Album Of The Year\" at the Swedish Grammy\'s (Grammis) \r\nOn the world charts it charted extremely well, reaching #23 in the US, top 10 in some European countries and Australia.

Whether an act or not, IAMX’s music is primarily concerned with subjects such as outlandish sex, death, narcotic intoxication, bisexuality, obsession, alienation and vague allusions to politics.\r\n\r\nWith the European marketplace going crazy for his blend of dramatic synth-rock, darkness-infused pop, and intricately-constructed indie dance, IAMX, originally from the Middlesbrough, United Kingdom but currently based in Los Angeles, has been headlining festivals in Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Poland, Ukraine etc. and sharing the stage with Placebo, Franz Ferdinand, and The Cardigans among others.\r\n\r\nLike an 80s electro glam soundtrack to a Jan Švankmajer film or an almost unfathomable hybrid between the sexy swagger of Prince and the cool and collected respectability of Roxy Music, IAMX mixes Chris’ erotically-charged vocals with music that is, at once, frantic yet controlled.\r\n\r\nWith such strikingly cinematic songs as the waltzy drama of \"President\" to the percussive sexual predatory dirtiness of \"The Negative Sex\" to the indelibly infectious synthpop of the sweeping \"Spit It Out\", The Alternative is exactly just that - the alternative to the cookie-cutter music scene that dominates the airwaves. Considering the rabid reception he receives from his performances, it seems it\'s time for the masses to grasp The Alternative.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of 2011 have witnessed the newest IAMX effort, Volatile Times. The sound quality being on par with virtually no fillers, the album draws on cabaret style (Bernadette is an example), another highlights include a fragile and haunting hymn of I Salute You, Christopher,  wooshing and energetically charged Into the Asylum with probably the most outspoken hysteria feel ever seen on Corner\'s songs, as well a sonic masterpiece Commanded by Voices with its waving and rippling yet mellow intro chords.. \r\n\r\nThe first single from Volatile Times, Ghosts of Utopia,  was released in Feb. 2011 and the video premiered in a short span of time. What would be the next Corners\' artistic step is remaining to be seen. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/IAMX\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

They joined 6131 Records in 2010. The band consists of lead vocalist and guitarist Barry Johnson, guitarist Chase Knobbe, bassist and back-up vocalist Matt Ebert, and drummer Pat Ware.

When he learned one of his favorite artists, Marvin Gaye, was a native Washingtonian, Tillman became further driven to forge his own musical path. A student of tradition, but also inspired by contemporary producers, Tillman’s sound is soulful R&B with a modern twist.\r\n\r\nTillman released his debut EP, Shangri La, on April 29, 2014, and quickly earned acclaim. His music has been covered in a wide variety of publications, including Okayplayer and Essence Magazine. His music has received radio airplay from the likes of KCRW and Gilles Peterson’s BBC 6 program.\r\n\r\nTillman’s new album, Silk Noise Reflex, introduces a new sound to today’s R&B and soul lexicon: Silk Noise. It’s sleek and polished, but human and feeling. The mood is effortless, though seems achieved through some sort of songwriting secret. The variety of influences is easy to hear, but how they work together so well is complex. A meeting of jazz, hip-hop, soul, R&B, psychedelia, and so much more, its cohesiveness is a testament to Tillman’s songwriting prowess and his vocal skill. Credit is also due to Beau Sorenson (Death Cab for Cutie, Garbage, Yellow Ostrich), who mixed the record at Tiny Telephone in Oakland; mastering engineer Carlos Arredondo (Thao & Mirah, Deerhoof); and executive producer Merrill Garbus (tUnE-yArDs, Sister Suvi).\r\n\r\nTours with tUnE-yArDs and Wild Child have brought Tillman around North America.

How the band came to be was a series of sliding doors moments and necessity, with both women 5000 miles apart during the pandemic and having their hearts broken, again and again. Bonding over literature and lyrical precision, the name Tommy Lefroy was born out of Jane Austen’s real life Mr Darcy - the original 19th-century fuckboy Thomas Langlois Lefroy - a man who broke the author\'s heart. The penny dropped when Tessa and Wynter thought: why can’t we be the strong female lead, and challenge literature’s traditional role of the male character: the heartbreaker? \r\n\r\nFirst meeting in Nashville in 2018, Bethel and Mouzourakis continually crossed paths at house parties. When Tessa went to see boygenius play in her hometown Vancouver, she watched in awe and thought: “I want this, I can do this.” She posted a cover of their song “Ketchum, ID” on her Instagram story and Wynter responded: “Can we start a band?”. Both strong and “laughably existential” female characters in their own lives, and together, a musical powerhouse with an enduring soul connection, Tommy Lefroy moved to London and released their first single “Northern Towns” in 2021, followed by highly praised debut EP, Flight Risk.\r\n\r\nConnecting with young female fans through perseverance, honesty, and lyrics that move you, make you cry and make you angry, the best friends have already won fans at NME, Apple, and now have over 1 Million monthly listeners on Spotify. But seeing the tangible effect their music has had on fans this summer at live shows has blown Wynter and Tessa away, for a project that started over Zoom in a dark time when collective effervescence was taken away. With queues around the block for their performance at The Great Escape, Tommy Lefroy played their second London headline to a sold-out Lexington last month, with fans singing back every lyric from Flight Risk, and are set to perform at UK festivals this summer, including Barn On The Farm, Kendal Calling and Secret Garden Party.\r\n\r\nBuilt as an anchor to get them through the uncertainty of 2020, the project has felt like an act of rebellion, against the constraints and expectations they had of themselves, derived from societal expectations of what it means to be a woman, especially in music. Capturing care-not independence in their lyrics and a do-all approach to their creative process they find inspiration from unapologetic female storytellers like poet, Anne Carson, as well as Joni Mithcell, Patti Smith, and Phoebe Bridgers, and creative contemporaries Sharon Van Etten, Samia, and Haim. As multi-intrumentalists and producers, they excel in sonically experimenting with the details of the world around them - from samples of the tube in their new home city of London, to friends mid-laughter and clinking glasses around the kitchen table.\r\n\r\nUncompromising, beautifully honest, and refreshingly themselves, Tommy Lefroy is a perceptive voice for the malaise of modern living and an inspiration for the confident recklessness that comes with being a storyteller. The stories, written for each other, for their friends, and for the lovers who left, detail the storms of tearaway youth, stumbling in and out of love, and finding humour along the way. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Tommy+Lefroy\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The band consists of Christie Simpson (vocals, keyboards), Josh Burgess (guitar, bass guitar, vocals, keyboards), Charlie Ryder (guitar, bass guitar, keyboards), and Olivia Campion (drums). The band\'s name is an amalgamation of the two friends that encouraged the group to start writing together.\r\n\r\nThe group\'s origins trace back to their history of playing concerts together in Christchurch. However, the band did not begin writing music together until multiple members moved abroad and began collaborating over email following the events of the Christchurch earthquake. This early material gained attention within the musical blogosphere and encouraged American label Cascine to sign the band before they had played live or held a band practice.\r\n\r\nBetween 2014 and 2015, the group released two EPs (EP I, EP II). The band\'s debut album Yoncalla was released in 2016, including the singles \"Keep It Close To Me\" and \"Barricade (Matter Of Fact)\". In 2017, the band released their second album, Willowbank, and the singles \"December\", \"Depths (Pt. I)\", and \"Half Hour\". EP III was released in 2018, including the singles \"In Camera\" and \"Crush (It\'s Late Just Stay)\". In 2020, the band signed to labels Polyvinyl Record Co. and Inertia Music, and released their third album Truth or Consequences, which featured the singles \"Right Track / Wrong Man\", \"Cool For A Second\", \"Southwark\", \"Lonely After\", and \"Sage\".\r\n\r\nFounded by Burgess, Ryder, and vocalist Kim Pflaum, the group began writing music using file-sharing services when Burgess left New Zealand to work at New York-based record label Captured Tracks. The band\'s first release, EP I, debuted in early 2014, after the single A Long Walk Home For Parted Lovers appeared on several blogs before being quickly taken down. The band was positively reviewed by Pitchfork and profiled by The Guardian, leading to the group signing with Brooklyn-based record label Cascine. In mid-2014, the band began playing live, touring with singer Lorde, and collaborating with other acts, such as the Swedish band Air France. Guitarist Sam Perry[ and vocalist Christie Simpson joined the group in 2015, while Pflaum left and started the solo project Madeira (later renamed Laumė). The band released a second EP, EP II, in early 2015, and proceeded to tour extensively throughout Europe, Asia, and North America, with the likes of Jamie xx and Lower Dens.\r\n\r\nThe band quickly released their first full-length album, Yoncalla, the following year. As opposed to the long-distance writing of the band\'s earlier releases, Yoncalla consisted of material that had been finished during tours for EP II. The majority of the album\'s final material was recorded in Paris, France, following an American tour that stopped by the city of Yoncalla, Oregon. The band produced the album at electronic musician Philippe Zdar\'s Motorbass studio in Paris, enabling them to achieve a sound more akin to classic synth-pop than their previous records.\r\n\r\nAfter a year of heavy touring in support of Yoncalla, the band traveled home to record in New Zealand for the first time. A limited edition cover of the Oasis album (What\'s The Story) Morning Glory? was distributed on vinyl in early 2017, before the release of the band\'s second album, Willowbank, in October. The sessions for Willowbank marked the first time that the group had worked together in a professional studio, with the band initially questioning whether they should \"all move into separate rooms\" to recreate the remote songwriting process from previous records. However, the sessions allowed for stronger collaboration and more organic instrumentation compared to earlier material, leading to jazz musician Olivia Campion joining the band as a live drummer. The lead single \"Depths (Pt. I)\" became a success on streaming platforms, and was accompanied by a video created by illustrator Frances Haszard. Following the completion of touring for Willowbank, Perry left the band in order to concentrate on his Serbia-based musical project DOG Power.\r\n\r\nIn wake of the departure of Perry, the remaining four members of the band proceeded to return to the methods of long-distance writing that had inspired their earlier material. This process led to the creation of a third EP, released in October 2018. A video for the lead single \"In Camera\" was released in early 2019, directed by Pavel Brenner. A video for the second single \"Crush (It\'s Late, Just Stay)\" was also released in 2019, directed by Robbie Barnett.\r\n\r\nAfter signing to Polyvinyl and Inertia Records, Yumi Zouma released their third studio album Truth or Consequences on March 13, 2020. The album features the singles \"Right Track / Wrong Man\", \"Cool For A Second\", \"Southwark\", \"Lonely After\", and \"Sage\". Along with the album, Yumi Zouma is set to release a unique line of merchandise which includes a candle, bandana, and enamel pin. The band announced a reimagined edition of the album named Truth or Consequences - Alternate Versions, which was released in October 2020.\r\n\r\nOn March 18, 2022, their fourth full-length release Present Tense was recorded remotely with some in-studio sessions in Los Angeles, London, Florence, New York, and New Zealand due to the COVID-19 pandemic. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Yumi+Zouma\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Cole and Drake on \"Like That\" as a response to Drake and J. Cole\'s 2023 song \"First Person Shooter\", where Cole claims that he, Drake, and Lamar are the \"big three\" in modern rap music. On April 5, Cole responded to Lamar on the diss track \"7 Minute Drill\", but in the week following its release, Cole apologized for the song and removed it from streaming services. Drake then released the songs \"Push Ups\" and \"Taylor Made Freestyle\" in April. \"Taylor Made Freestyle\" was later deleted from social media over copyright concerns from Tupac Shakur\'s estate.\r\nIn response, Lamar released \"Euphoria\" on April 30 and \"6:16 in LA\" on May 3. Drake responded with \"Family Matters\" later on the 3rd, accusing Lamar of being a domestic abuser and alleging that one of Lamar\'s children was fathered by Dave Free. Less than an hour later, Lamar released \"Meet the Grahams\", accusing Drake of sex trafficking, being a sexual predator, and fathering a second secret child (in a 2018 diss track by Pusha T, it was revealed that Drake was secretly fathering his son Adonis). Lamar then released \"Not Like Us\" the following day, more explicitly accusing Drake of pedophilia and disrespecting the rap scene. On May 5, Drake responded with \"The Heart Part 6\", denying Lamar\'s accusations and claiming that his team gave Lamar false information about the secret child.\r\nSeveral publications have described Lamar as winning the feud in popular consensus, citing music critics and social media users. Some commentators have praised the rivalry\'s spectacle and the significance it gave to modern hip-hop, while others have criticized both artists for the way they made and responded to each other\'s accusations Lamar has been supported by Metro Boomin, Future, Pusha T, Kanye West, The Weeknd, ASAP Rocky, Rick Ross, and Jay Rock, among others.[note 4] The music video for not like us was met with widespread critical acclaim.

He is the founder and current CEO of Aftermath Entertainment and a former co-owner and artist of Death Row Records, also having produced albums for and overseeing the careers of many rappers signed to those record labels. As a producer he is credited as a key figure in the popularization of West Coast G-funk, a style of rap music characterized as synthesizer-based with slow, bass heavy beats. \r\nDr. Dre began his career in music as a member of the World Class Wreckin\' Cru and he later found fame with the influential gangsta rap group N.W.A, which popularized the use of explicit lyrics in rap to detail the violence of street life. His 1992 solo debut The Chronic, released under Death Row Records, led him to become one of the best-selling American performing artists of 1993. In 1996 he left Death Row to found his own label Aftermath Entertainment, producing a compilation album, Dr. Dre Presents the Aftermath, in 1997 and releasing a solo album titled 2001 in 1999.\r\n\r\nDuring the 2000s he focused his career on production for other artists, while occasionally contributing vocals in other artists\' songs. Rolling Stone named him among the highest-paid performers of 2001 and 2004. Dr. Dre also had acting roles in the 2001 films The Wash and Training Day. In 2011, his final solo studio album, Detox, is set to be released following much delay and speculation.\r\n\r\nEarly life\r\n\r\nThe first child of Verna and Theodore Young, Dr. Dre was born as André Romelle Young on February 18, 1965. His mother was only 16 years old at the time of his birth, after being impregnated by teenage boyfriend Theodore, whom she later married. Young\'s middle name, \"Romelle\", came from Theodore Young\'s unsigned, amateur R&B singing group The Romells. In 1968 his mother divorced Theodore Young for another man, Curtis Crayon, and had other children with him, including two sons named Jerome and Tyree (both of whom are now deceased)[8][9] and daughter Shameka.[10] As a young child, Young was fascinated with vinyl records spinning on phonographs; his family\'s record collection included many popular R&B albums of the 1960s and 1970s, from such singers as Diana Ross, James Brown, and Aretha Franklin. According to an interview with the Los Angeles Times, his mother Verna found R&B music to be a relief from the two jobs she had to work daily.[11] Despite economic troubles, she continued to encourage Young not to give up in life. During Verna\'s second marriage, Young and his step-brother Tyree were raised primarily by their grandmother and Curtis Crayon, as their mother spent much time in search of work.[12]\r\n\r\nIn 1976 Young began attending Vanguard Junior High School and had a new sister named Shameka. However, due to gang violence around Vanguard, he transferred to nearby Roosevelt Junior High School.[13] Verna later married Warren Griffin, whom she met at her new job in Long Beach,[14] which added three new stepsisters and one new stepbrother to the family. The stepbrother, Warren Griffin III, would eventually become a rapper under the stage name Warren G.[15]\r\n\r\nYoung attended Centennial High School in Compton during his freshman year in 1979 but transferred to Fremont High School due to poor grades. On December 15, 1981, Young fathered a son with Lisa Johnson, however Curtis Young was not brought up by his father and they only met when Curtis had become rapper Hood Surgeon about 20 years later.[16] He was nearly enrolled to an apprenticeship program at Northrop Aviation Company until poor grades at school made him ineligible. Therefore, he focused on social life and entertainment for most of his high school years.[17]\r\n\r\nMusic career\r\n\r\nWorld Class Wreckin\' Cru (1984–1985)\r\nInspired by the Grandmaster Flash song \"The Adventures of Grandmaster Flash on the Wheels of Steel\", he often attended a club called The Eve After Dark to watch many DJs and rappers performing live. Thus, he became a DJ in the club, initially under the name \"Dr. J\" based on the nickname for Julius Erving, his favorite basketball player. At the club, he met aspiring rapper Antoine Carraby, later to become member DJ Yella of his group N.W.A.[18] Soon afterwards he adopted the moniker Dr. Dre, a mix of previous alias Dr. J and his first name, referring to himself as the \"Master of Mixology\".[19] He later joined the musical group World Class Wreckin\' Cru under the independent Kru-Cut Records in 1984. The group would become stars of the electro-hop scene that dominated early 1980s West Coast hip hop, and their first hit \"Surgery\" would prominently feature Dr. Dre on the turntables and sell 50,000 copies within the Compton area.[20] Dr. Dre and DJ Yella also performed mixes for local radio station KDAY, boosting ratings for its afternoon rush-hour show The Traffic Jam.[21]\r\n\r\nDue to the amount of time Dr. Dre was spending on his rap music he frequently skipped school, affecting his education. His absences also jeopardized his position as a diver for his school\'s swim team. However, when he did attend he received good grades in certain classes. After high school, he attended Chester Adult School in Compton following his mother\'s demands for him to get a job or go to school. After brief attendance at a radio broadcasting school, he relocated to the residence of his father and residence of his grandparents before returning to his mother\'s house.[22] He later dropped out of Chester to focus on performing at the Eve\'s After Dark nightclub.[23]\r\n\r\nN.W.A and Ruthless Records (1986–1991)\r\nIn 1986 he met rapper Ice Cube, who collaborated with Dr. Dre to record songs for Ruthless Records, a rap record label run by local rapper and drug dealer Eazy-E. N.W.A however, along with fellow west coast rapper Ice T, debuted with rhymes including profanity and gritty depictions of crime and life on the street. No longer constricted to racially charged political issues pioneered by rap artists such as Public Enemy or Boogie Down Productions, N.W.A shot out with hardcore and realistic perspective of street violence and local black gangster lifestyle. Propelled by the hit \"Fuck tha Police\", the group\'s first full album Straight Outta Compton became a major success, despite an almost complete absence of radio airplay or major concert tours and warnings from the FBI.[2] The FBI sent letters to Arabian Prince, Ice Cube and Eazy-E urging them to stop releasing their music as a response to the large amount of complaints they had received about the group\'s lyrical content and use of expletives.[24]\r\n\r\nAfter Ice Cube left N.W.A over financial disputes, Dr. Dre produced and performed for much of the group\'s second album Efil4zaggin. He also produced tracks for a number of other rap acts on Ruthless Records, including Above the Law, and The D.O.C. for the album No One Can Do It Better.[25] In 1991 at a music industry party in Hollywood, he assaulted television host Dee Barnes of the Fox television program Pump it Up, after he felt dissatisfied by a news report of hers on the feud between the remaining N.W.A members and Ice Cube. Thus, Dr. Dre was fined $2,500 and given two years\' probation and 240 hours of community service, as well as a spot on an anti-violence public service announcement on television.[26][27]\r\n\r\nThe Chronic and Death Row Records (1992–1995)\r\nAfter a dispute with Wright, Young left the group at the peak of its popularity in 1991 under the advice of friend, and N.W.A lyricist, The D.O.C. and his bodyguard at the time, Suge Knight. Knight, a notorious strongman and intimidator, was able to have Wright release Young from his contract and, using Dr. Dre as his flagship artist, found Death Row Records. In 1992 Young released his first single, the title track to the film Deep Cover, a collaboration with a rapper whom he met through his own stepbrother and rapper Warren G, Snoop Dogg.[2] Dr. Dre\'s debut album was The Chronic under Death Row Records. Young ushered in a new style of rap, both in terms of musical style and lyrical content.[28]\r\n\r\nOn the strength of singles such as \"Nuthin\' but a \'G\' Thang\", featuring protegé Snoop Doggy Dogg and hits like \"Let Me Ride\" and \"Fuck wit Dre Day (and Everybody\'s Celebratin\')\" (known as \"Dre Day\" for radio and television play), The Chronic became a cultural phenomenon, its G-funk sound dominating much of hip hop music for the early 1990s.[2] In 1993 the Recording Industry Association of America certified the album multi-platinum,[29] and Dr. Dre also won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance for his performance in \"Let Me Ride\".[30] For that year, Billboard magazine also ranked Dr. Dre as the eighth best-selling musical artist, The Chronic as the sixth best-selling album, and \"Nuthin\' but a \'G\' Thang\" as the 11th best-selling single.[3]\r\n\r\nBesides working on his own material, Dr. Dre produced Snoop Dogg\'s debut album Doggystyle, which became the first debut album for an artist to debut at number one on the Billboard 200 album charts.[31] Young also produced other West Coast rap albums of Death Row Records, including Dogg Food by Tha Dogg Pound and the album Regulate...G Funk Era by his stepbrother Warren G. In 1994 Dr. Dre produced the soundtracks to the films Above the Rim and Murder Was the Case and the single \"No Diggity\" by Blackstreet. He collaborated with fellow N.W.A member Ice Cube for the song \"Natural Born Killaz\" in 1995.[2]\r\n\r\nIn 1995, just as Death Row Records was signing rapper 2Pac and positioning him as their major star, Young left the label amidst a contract dispute and growing concerns that label boss Suge Knight was corrupt, financially dishonest and out of control. Thus, in 1996, he formed his own label Aftermath Entertainment directly underneath the distributor label for Death Row Records, Interscope Records.[2] Consequently, Death Row Records suffered poor sales by 1997, especially following the death of 2Pac and the racketeering charges brought against Knight.[32]\r\n\r\nMove to Aftermath Entertainment (1996–1998)\r\nThe Dr. Dre Presents the Aftermath album, released on November 26, 1996, featured songs by Dr. Dre himself as well as by newly signed Aftermath artists, and a solo track \"Been There, Done That\", intended as a symbolic farewell to gangsta rap.[33] Despite being classified platinum by the RIAA[34], the album was not very popular among music fans.[2] In October 1996 Dr. Dre appeared on the sketch comedy program Saturday Night Live, broadcast on the NBC television network in the United States, to perform \"Been There, Done That\".[35] In 1997 Young produced several tracks on Nas, Foxy Brown, AZ, and Nature Present The Firm: The Album; although the album went platinum, it was met with similarly negative reviews from critics. Rumors began to abound that Aftermath was facing financial difficulties.[36]\r\n\r\nThe turning point for Aftermath came in 1998, when Jimmy Iovine, the head of Aftermath\'s parent label Interscope, suggested that Young sign the white Detroit rapper Marshall Mathers, artistically known as Eminem, to Aftermath. Young produced three songs and provided vocals for two on his controversial album, (\"My Name Is\", \"Guilty Conscience\" and \"Role Model\") in 1999.[37]\r\n\r\n2001 (1999–2000)\r\nDr. Dre\'s second solo album, 2001, released in the fall of 1999, was considered an ostentatious return to his gangsta rap roots.[38] It was initially titled The Chronic 2000 to imply being a sequel to his debut album The Chronic but was re-titled 2001 after Death Row Records released an unrelated compilation album earlier in 1999. Other tentative titles included The Chronic 2001 and Dr. Dre.[39] The album featured numerous collaborators, including Devin the Dude, Hittman, Snoop Dogg, Xzibit, Nate Dogg and Eminem. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of the website All Music Guide described the sound of the album as \"adding ominous strings, soulful vocals, and reggae\" to Dr. Dre\'s style.[38] The album was highly successful, charting at number two on the Billboard 200 charts[40] and has since been certified six times platinum,[29] thus reaffirming a recurring theme featured in its lyrics, stating that Dr. Dre was still a force to be reckoned with, despite the lack of major releases in the previous few years. The album included popular hit singles \"Still D.R.E.\" and \"Forgot About Dre\", both of which Dr. Dre performed on NBC\'s Saturday Night Live on October 23, 1999.[41] Dr. Dre won the Grammy Award for Producer of the Year in 2000,[2] and joined the Up in Smoke Tour with fellow rappers Eminem, Snoop Dogg, and Ice Cube that year as well.[42]\r\nDuring the course of the popularity of 2001, Dr. Dre was involved in several lawsuits. Lucasfilm Ltd., the film company behind the Star Wars film franchise, sued him over the use of the THX-trademarked \"Deep Note\".[43] The Fatback Band also sued Dr. Dre over alleged infringement of its song \"Backstrokin\'\" in his song \"Let\'s Get High\" from the 2001 album; Dr. Dre was ordered to pay $1.5 million to the band in 2003.[44] The online music file-sharing company Napster also settled a lawsuit with him and heavy metal rock band Metallica in the summer of 2001, agreeing to block access to certain files that artists do not want to have shared on the network.[45]\r\n\r\nFocus on production (2001–present)\r\nFollowing the success of 2001, Dr. Dre focused on producing songs and albums for other artists. He produced the single \"Family Affair\" by R&B singer Mary J. Blige for her album No More Drama in 2001.[4] Other successful albums that he produced for Aftermath have included the major-label debut album by Queens, New York-based rapper 50 Cent, Get Rich or Die Tryin\', in 2003. The album featured the Dr. Dre-produced hit single \"In da Club\", as a joint production between Aftermath, Eminem\'s boutique label Shady Records and Interscope.[46] Dr. Dre also produced \"How We Do\", a 2005 hit single of rapper The Game from his album The Documentary.[47]\r\nAnother copyright-related lawsuit came upon Dr. Dre in the fall of 2002, when Sa Re Ga Ma, a film and music company based in Calcutta, India, sued Aftermath Entertainment over an uncredited sample of the Lata Mangeshkar song \"Thoda Resham Lagta Hai\" on the Aftermath-produced song \"Addictive\" by singer Truth Hurts. In February 2003, a judge ruled that Aftermath would have to halt sales of Truth Hurts\' album Truthfully Speaking if the company would not credit Mangeshkar.[48] In April 2003 rapper Ja Rule released a mixtape of freestyle raps criticizing Dr. Dre and his associated artists 50 Cent and Eminem.[49] At the Vibe magazine awards show in November 2004, Dr. Dre was attacked by a fan named Jimmy James Johnson, who was asking for an autograph. Johnson, in September 2005, was sentenced to a year in prison and ordered to stay away from Dr. Dre until 2008.[50] For an issue of Rolling Stone magazine in April 2005, Kanye West praised Dr. Dre as among the greatest performing artists of all time.[51]\r\n\r\nIn November 2006 Dr. Dre began working with Raekwon on his album Only Built 4 Cuban Linx II.[52] He also contributed to the rap albums Buck the World by Young Buck[53] and Curtis by 50 Cent.[54] Other upcoming albums that he is involved with includeThe Reformation by Bishop Lamont,[55] The Nacirema Dream by Papoose,[56] Here I Am by Eve,[57] and L.A.X. by The Game.[58] Among planned but unreleased albums during Dr. Dre\'s tenure at Aftermath have included a full-length reunion with Snoop Dogg titled Breakup to Makeup, an album with fellow former N.W.A member Ice Cube which was to be titled Heltah Skeltah, an N.W.A reunion album, and a joint album with fellow producer Timbaland titled Chairmen of the Board.[59][25][60]\r\n\r\nDetox: Final album\r\nDetox is to be Dr. Dre\'s final album.[7] In 2002, Dre told Corey Moss of MTV News that he intended Detox to be a concept album.[6] Work for the album dates back to early 2004,[61] but later in that year he decided to stop working on the album to focus on producing for other artists but then changed his mind; the album had initially been set for a fall 2005 release.[62] After several delays, the album was finally scheduled to be released sometime in 2008 by Interscope Records, which has not set a firm release date for the album as of September 2007.[7] Producers confirmed to work on the album include Bernard \"Focus\" Edwards Jr.,[63] Hi-Tek,[64] J.R. Rotem,[65] RZA,[66] Jay-Z,[67] and Warren G.[68]\r\n\r\nFilm career\r\nIn 2001 Dr. Dre appeared in the movies The Wash and Training Day.[69] A song of his, \"Bad Intentions\" (featuring Knoc-Turn\'Al) and produced by Mahogany, was featured on The Wash soundtrack.[70] Dr. Dre also appeared on two other songs \"On the Blvd.\" and \"The Wash\" along with his co-star Snoop Dogg. In February 2007 it was announced that Dr. Dre would produce dark comedies and horror films for New Line-owned company Crucial Films, along with longtime video director Phillip Atwell. Dr. Dre announced \"This is a natural switch for me, since I\'ve directed a lot of music videos, and I eventually want to get into directing.\"[71]\r\n\r\nMusical influences and style\r\nDr. Dre has said that his primary instrument in the studio is the Akai MPC3000, a drum machine and sampler, and that he uses as many as four or five to produce a single recording. He cites George Clinton, Isaac Hayes and Curtis Mayfield as primary musical influences. Unlike most rap producers, he tries to avoid samples as much as possible, preferring to have studio musicians re-play pieces of music he wants to use, because it allows him more flexibility to change the pieces in rhythm and tempo.[59] In 2001 he told Time magazine, \"I may hear something I like on an old record that may inspire me, but I\'d rather use musicians to re-create the sound or elaborate on it. I can control it better.\"[72] Other equipment he uses include the E-mu SP-1200 drum machine and other keyboards from such manufacturers as Korg, Rhodes, Wurlitzer, Moog, and Roland.[73]\r\n\r\nAfter founding Aftermath Entertainment in 1996, Dr. Dre took on producer Mel-Man as a co-producer, and his music took on a more synthesizer-based sound, using fewer vocal samples (as he had used on \"Lil\' Ghetto Boy\" and \"Let Me Ride\" on The Chronic, for example). Mel-Man has not shared co-production credits with Dr. Dre since approximately 2002, but fellow Aftermath producer Focus has credited Mel-Man as a key architect of the signature Aftermath sound.[74]\r\n\r\nIn 1999 Dr. Dre started working with Mike Elizondo, a bassist, guitarist, and keyboardist who has also produced, written and played on records for female singers such as Poe, Fiona Apple and Alanis Morissette,[75] for his album 2001. Elizondo has since worked for many of Dr. Dre\'s productions.[76][77] Dr. Dre also told Scratch magazine in a 2004 interview that he has been studying piano and music theory formally, and that a major goal is to accumulate enough musical theory to score movies. In the same interview he stated that he has collaborated with famed 1960s songwriter Burt Bacharach by sending him hip hop beats to play over, and hopes to have an in-person collaboration with him in the future.[59]\r\n\r\nWork ethic\r\nDr. Dre has stated that he is a perfectionist, and is known to pressure the artists with whom he records to give flawless performances.[59] In 2006 Snoop Dogg told the website Dubcnn.com that Dr. Dre had made new artist Chauncey Black re-record a single bar of vocals 107 times.[78] Dr. Dre has also stated that Eminem is a fellow perfectionist, and attributes his success on Aftermath to his like-minded work ethic.[59]\r\n\r\nA consequence of this perfectionism is that some artists that initially sign deals with Dr. Dre\'s Aftermath label never release albums. In 2001, Aftermath released the soundtrack to the movie The Wash. featuring a number of Aftermath acts such as Shaunta, Daks, Joe Beast and Toi. To date, none have released full-length albums on Aftermath and have apparently ended their relationships with the label and Dr. Dre. Other noteworthy acts to leave Aftermath without releasing albums include King Tee, 2001 vocalist Hittman and 1980s rap icon Rakim.[79]\r\n\r\nHowever, over the years word of other collaborators has surfaced. During his tenure at Death Row Records, it was alleged that Dr. Dre\'s half brother Warren G and Tha Dogg Pound member Daz made many uncredited contributions to songs on his solo album The Chronic and Snoop Doggy Dogg\'s album Doggystyle (Daz received production credits on Snoop\'s similar-sounding, albeit less successful album Tha Doggfather after Young left Death Row Records).[80]\r\n\r\nIt is known that Scott Storch, who has since gone on to become a successful producer in his own right, contributed to Dr. Dre\'s second album 2001; Storch is credited as a songwriter on several songs and played keyboards on several tracks. In 2006 he told Rolling Stone:\r\n\r\n    \"At the time, I saw Dr. Dre desperately needed something,\" Storch says. \"He needed a fuel injection, and Dr. Dre utilized me as the nitrous oxide. He threw me into the mix, and I sort of tapped on a new flavor with my whole piano sound and the strings and orchestration. So I\'d be on the keyboards, and Mike [Elizondo] was on the bass guitar, and Dr. Dre was on the drum machine\".[81]\r\n\r\nCurrent collaborator Mike Elizondo, when speaking about his work with Young, describes their recording process as a collaborative effort involving several musicians. In 2004 he claimed to Songwriter Universe magazine that he had written the foundations of the hit Eminem song \"The Real Slim Shady\", stating, \"I initially played a bass line on the song, and Dr. Dre, Tommy Coster Jr. and I built the track from there. Eminem then heard the track, and he wrote the rap to it.\"[77] This account is essentially confirmed by Eminem in his book Angry Blonde, stating that the tune for the song was composed by a studio bassist and keyboardist while Dr. Dre was out of the studio but later programmed the song\'s beat after returning.[82]\r\n\r\nFurthermore, in the September 2003 issue of The Source, a group of disgruntled former associates of Dr. Dre complained that they had not received their full due for work on the label. A producer named Neff-U claimed to have produced the songs \"Say What You Say\" and \"My Dad\'s Gone Crazy\" on The Eminem Show, the songs \"If I Can\'t\" and \"Back Down\" on 50 Cent\'s Get Rich or Die Tryin\', and the beat featured on Dr. Dre\'s commercial for Coors beer.[79]\r\n\r\nAlthough Young studies piano and musical theory, he serves as more of a conductor than a musician himself, as Josh Tyrangiel of Time magazine has noted:\r\n\r\n    Every Dre track begins the same way, with Dre behind a drum machine in a room full of trusted musicians. (They carry beepers. When he wants to work, they work.) He\'ll program a beat, then ask the musicians to play along; when Dre hears something he likes, he isolates the player and tells him how to refine the sound. \"My greatest talent,\" Dre says, \"is knowing exactly what I want to hear.\"[72]\r\n\r\nAlthough Snoop Dogg retains working relationships with Warren G and Daz, who are alleged to be uncredited contributors on the hit albums The Chronic and Doggystyle, he states that Dr. Dre is capable of making beats without the help of collaborators.[83] It should be noted that Dr. Dre\'s prominent studio collaborators, including Scott Storch, Elizondo, Mark Batson and Dawaun Parker, have shared co-writing, instrumental, and more recently co-production credits on the songs where he is credited as the producer.\r\n\r\nIt is also widely acknowledged that most of Dr. Dre\'s raps are written for him by others, though he retains ultimate control over his lyrics and the themes of his songs. As Aftermath Producer Mahogany told Scratch: \"It\'s like a class room in [the booth]. He\'ll have three writers in there. They\'ll bring in something, he\'ll recite it, then he\'ll say. \'Change this line, change this word,\' like he\'s grading papers.\"[84] As seen in the credits for tracks Young has appeared on, there are often multiple people who contribute to his songs (although it should be noted that often in hip hop many people are officially credited as a writer for a song, even the producer). As a member of N.W.A, The D.O.C. wrote lyrics for him while he stuck with producing.[85] Popular rapper Jay-Z ghostwrote lyrics for the single \"Still D.R.E.\" from Dr. Dre\'s album 2001.[39]\r\n\r\nDiscography\r\n\r\n    * 1992: The Chronic\r\n    * 1999: 2001\r\n    * 2008: Detox\r\n\r\nAwards and nominations\r\n\r\n    * \"Let Me Ride\"—Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance - 1994\r\n    * \"California Love\"—Grammy Award Nomination as Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group (with 2Pac and Roger Troutman) - 1997.\r\n    * \"No Diggity\"—Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals (with Blackstreet and Queen Pen) - 1998\r\n    * \"Forgot About Dre\"—Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance By A Duo Or Group - 2001 | (with Eminem)\r\n    * \"Still D.R.E.\"—Grammy Award Nomination Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group (with Snoop Dogg) and The Source Awards Nomination Single of the year (2000)\r\n    * The Marshall Mathers LP—Grammy Award for Best Rap Album - 2001 (with Eminem)\r\n\r\nPersonal life\r\n\r\nMarriages and family\r\n\r\nFrom 1990 to 1996 Dr. Dre dated singer Michel\'le, who frequently contributed vocals to Death Row Records albums. In 1991 the couple had a son, Marcel. In May 1996 Dr. Dre married Nicole Threatt, who was formerly married to NBA player Sedale Threatt.[86] Dr. Dre and Nicole have two children together: a son named Truth (born 1997) and a daughter named Truly (born 2001).[87] He is also the biological father of rapper Hood Surgeon (real name Curtis Young), impregnating his mother, Lisa Johnson, at 16 when he was 17.[88]\r\n\r\nIncome\r\n\r\nIn 2001, Dr. Dre earned a total of about $52 million from selling part of his share of Aftermath Entertainment to Interscope Records and his production of such hit songs that year as \"Family Affair\" by Mary J. Blige. Rolling Stone magazine thus named him the second highest-paid artist of the year.[4] Dr. Dre was ranked 44th in 2004 from earnings of just $11.4 million, primarily from production royalties from such projects as albums from G-Unit and D12 and the single \"Rich Girl\" by singer Gwen Stefani and rapper Eve.[5]\r\n\r\nFilmography\r\nYear 	Title 	Role\r\n1992 	Niggaz4Life: The Only Home Video 	Himself\r\n1994 	Set It Off 	Black Sam\r\n2000 	Up In Smoke Tour 	Himself\r\n2001 	Training Day 	Paul\r\nThe Wash 	Sean <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Dr.+Dre\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

He had made a collab with the famous rapper Zico back in 2008, the track can be found on many platforms including YouTube and SoundCloud.\r\n\r\nIn early 2015, RM earned not only the approval from big names in the Korean Hip-hop scene, but he had also gained respect from the American Hip-hop figure Warren G. The two came together for the track \"P.D.D\", where RM asks his haters to stay alive to witness his success. The west coast rapper stated in an interview with CJ America, \"I couldn’t understand all his lyrics, but I can say that it was very good because his flow, style, and rhythm are all excellent.” He then even went on to say, \"When I hear Rap Monster’s songs, it sounds like Snoop Dogg or me rapping with the beats we’ve made.” \r\n\r\n On March 4, 2015, RM released a single with Warren G entitled, \"P.D.D (Please Don\'t Die)\" ahead of his first solo mixtape RM following an offer by Warren G to collaborate. The track reflected how RM felt towards those who hated and criticized him at the time, which he used to find very upsetting.\r\n\r\nThat same March, RM collaborated with hip hop project group MFBTY, EE and Dino J on the song \"Bucku Bucku\".

A project containing a few collaborations (with artists such as HONNE, NELL, eAeon) where Nam-joon experimented with lofi Hip-Hop and ballad. Though different from his previous works, he was still able to showcase his soul-deep lyricism, where he often implemented his skill of using wordplay and metaphors to further reach his listeners. With this mixtape, he continued to explore his own identity and life through a microscope, touching topics like loneliness, self-doubt, longing, and even explored the concept of love and hate. \'mono\' proved RM a unique artist of diversity and growth.

The group\'s current line-up consists of will.i.am, Taboo and apl.de.ap. Black Eyed Peas have so-far sold an estimated 56 million albums and singles worldwide.\r\n\r\nBlack Eyed Peas went to centenary state high school and got their start in 1988 when will.i.am (born 1975 William James Adams Jr.) and apl.de.ap (born 1974 Allan Pineda) began rapping and performing together around Los Angeles. The pair signed to Ruthless Records (run by Eazy-E) after catching the attention of the nephew of Jerry Heller (Eazy-E\'s manager). Along with Mookie Mook (Burning Star), Dante Santiago & DJ Motiv8, they called their group A.T.B.A.N. Klann. Their debut album, \'Grass Roots\', was not released originally because Ruthless did not consider the social themes reflected in the group\'s music to be marketable to their audience. A single \"Puddles of H2O\" was released in 1994 but no album was released (until it leaked onto the Internet in the mid 2000s). \r\n\r\nAfter Eazy-E died of an AIDS related illness in 1995, they changed their name to Black Eyed Peas; will.i.am explained on the front cover of the Monkey Business album that \"Black Eyed Peas are food for the soul\", hence the name. will.i.am has cited the Red Hot Chili Peppers as an influence and said he named his band after a food, like them. They replaced their original third member Mookie, with Dante Santiago the Peas original singer. Then Taboo (born Jaime Gomez) joined the group. Dante Santiago took on a role as a guest vocalist in the band and featured frequently on various tracks for their first four albums. \r\n\r\nIn 1996, they produced and appeared on a song entitled \"That\'s Right\" for Brian Austin Green\'s hip-hop album One Stop Carnival. Later, they began using Kim Hill as a steady background singer. Unlike many hip-hop acts, they chose to perform with a live band and adopted a musical and clothing style that differed wildly from the \"gangsta rap\" sounds of other Los Angeles-based hip-hop acts at the time. Through the mid-\'90s, they performed in the local club circuit alongside fellow acts such as Ozomatli and Jurassic 5.\r\n\r\nThe group were signed to Interscope Records and released their debut, \"Behind the Front\", in 1998. The album won the group (and their accompanying live band, the Bucky Jonsons) critical acclaim. The album featured the single \"Joints & Jams\", which was included on the Bulworth soundtrack. Their second album, \"Bridging the Gap\", was released in 2000; it featured the single \"Request + Line\" featuring Macy Gray.\r\n\r\nAfter replacing their female background singer with Fergie, the group released their breakout album, \"Elephunk\", and their 2005 album, \"Monkey Business\", which featured the hit singles \"Pump It\", \"Don\'t Phunk With My Heart\", \"Don\'t Lie\" and \"My Humps\".\r\n\r\n\"The E.N.D.

The son of jazz musician Olu Dara, he was raised in the infamous Queensbridge housing projects in Queensbridge, New York. According to the Nasty Songfacts, as a teenager rapper, Nasir  first went by the nickname Kid Wave before adopting his more commonly known alias of Nasty Nas. By the time he released his landmark solo debut album Illmatic in 1994, Jones was known as Nas. \r\n\r\nIllmatic was a critically acclaimed bestseller and is widely considered one of the greatest rap albums of all time. He married R&B singer Kelis in 2005, they have one son together, and she filed for divorce on the 29th of April 2009. Nas was also a part of hip hop supergroup The Firm, which released one album.\r\n\r\nIn the years following the release of Illmatic, Nas pursued a more commercial direction, which resulted in wider success but decreased artistic credibility among critics and hip-hop purists. Furthermore, Nas\' increased commercial success was accompanied by stylistic changes that fostered accusations of \"selling out\". Nevertheless, the LP Stillmatic is often credited for restoring Nas\' credibility among fans. Since the success of Stillmatic, Nas continues to maintain a high profile within the hip hop community, and has pursued a decidedly progressive and personal aesthetic. While Nas\' current artistic direction differs greatly from his most successful work, it has ensured that he remains one of the most respected and acclaimed contemporary rappers.\r\n\r\n1973–1992: Childhood and early career\r\n\r\nNas was born in Brooklyn, New York, as the elder of Olu Dara and Fannie Ann Jones\'s two children; his brother Jabari (nicknamed \"Jungle\" because he was born in the Congo) is the younger of the two. The family lived for a time in Brooklyn, before moving to Queensbridge, the largest public housing project in the United States. Olu Dara left the household in 1986, when Nas was 13, and Ann Jones raised her two boys on her own. Nas dropped out of school in the eighth grade and began selling drugs on the streets of New York. He educated himself, reading about African culture and civilization, the Qur\'an, the Bible and the Five Percent Nation. He also studied the origin of hip hop music, taping records that played on his local radio station. As a child, Nas had wanted to be an instrumentalist (at the age of three, Nas played his father\'s trumpet on the step of their Brooklyn home) and also a comic book artist. Shortly after his parents separated, Nas began to write short stories as he immersed himself deeper into hip-hop culture.\r\n\r\nBy his preteen years, he had settled on pursuing a career as a rapper, and as a teenager enlisted his best friend and upstairs neighbor Willie \"Ill Will\" Graham as his DJ. Nas first went by the nickname Kid Wave before adopting his more commonly known alias of Nasty Nas. Nas and Graham soon met hip-hop producer and Flushing Queens resident Large Professor, who introduced Nas to his group, Main Source. In 1991, Nas made his on-record debut with a verse on \"Live at the BBQ\", from Main Source\'s LP Breaking Atoms. Despite the substantial buzz for Nas in the underground scene, the rapper was rejected by major labels and was not signed to a recording deal. Nas and Graham continued to work together, but their partnership was cut short when Graham was shot and killed by a gunman in Queensbridge on May 23, 1992.\r\n\r\n1992–1995: The recording and release of Illmatic\r\n\r\nIn mid-1992, Nas was approached by MC Serch of 3rd Bass, who became his manager and secured Nas a record deal with Columbia Records the same year. Nas made his solo debut on the single \"Halftime\" from Serch\'s soundtrack for the film Zebrahead. The single increased the buzz surrounding Nas and when MC Serch’s solo album is released later in the year, Nas’ standout appearance on \"Back To The Grill\" only intensified interest in his upcoming album, amid immense anticipation. Hailed as the second coming of Rakim, his rhyming skills attracted a significant amount of attention within the hip-hop community. However, many were concerned that Columbia, being a major label, would try to dilute his New York based style.\r\n\r\nIn 1994, Nas\' debut album, Illmatic was finally released. Critically acclaimed and widely regarded as one of the premier rap albums ever created, Illmatic featured lyrics that portrayed stunning visual imagery and production courtesy of several producers . The album featured production from Large Professor, Pete Rock, Q-Tip (of A Tribe Called Quest) and DJ Premier, as well as guest appearances from Nas\' friend AZ and his father Olu Dara on the song \"Life\'s a Bitch\", Illmatic was immediately hailed as a masterpiece by critics, and is still highly regarded as one of the definitive hip-hop albums of all time. Notable songs on the album included \"NY State of Mind\" (produced by Premier), \"The World Is Yours\" (produced by Pete Rock), \"One Love\" (produced by Q-Tip) and \"It Ain\'t Hard To Tell\" (produced by Large Professor and featuring a sample of \"Human Nature\" by Michael Jackson). However, due in part to extensive bootlegging, the record sales fell below expectations.\r\n\r\nFollowing Illmatic, Nas appeared on AZ\'s Doe Or Die album, and collaborated with his Queensbridge-associates, Mobb Deep, on their album, The Infamous. One notable achievement during this period was Nas\' verse on \"Verbal Intercourse\" on Raekwon\'s Only Built 4 Cuban Linx. After this appearance, Nas received a Source Quotable as he had the distinction of being the only non-Wu-Tang Clan member to be featured on one of the group\'s solo albums.\r\n\r\n1996–1998: From It Was Written to The Firm\r\n\r\nColumbia began to press Nas to work towards more commercial topics like the rapper The Notorious B.I.G., who had become successful by releasing street singles that still retained pop-friendly appeal. Nas traded manager MC Serch for Steve Stoute, and began preparation for his second LP, It Was Written, consciously working towards a crossover-oriented sound. It Was Written, chiefly produced by Poke and Tone of Trackmasters Entertainment, was released during the summer of 1996. Two singles, \"If I Ruled The World (Imagine That)\" (featuring Lauryn Hill of The Fugees) and \"Street Dreams\" (a remix features R. Kelly) were instant hits. These songs were promoted by big-budget music videos directed by Hype Williams, making Nas a common name among mainstream hip-hop. Other notable tracks on the album included \"The Message\" and \"I Gave You Power,\" which tells a story from the perspective of a gun. It Was Written also featured the debut of The Firm, a supergroup consisting of Nas, AZ, Foxy Brown, and Cormega. The album also introduced Nas\'s Mafioso-inspired character \"Nas Escobar\", who lived more of a Scarface/Casino-esque lifestyle. On the other hand, Illmatic, which, while having numerous references to Tony Montana and the theatrical hit featuring Al Pacino, was more about Nas\' life as a teenager in the projects, hustling and smoking marijuana.\r\n\r\nThe Firm signed to Dr. Dre\'s Aftermath Entertainment label, and began working on their debut album. Halfway through the production of the album, Cormega was fired from the group by Steve Stoute, who had unsuccessfully attempted to force Cormega to sign a deal with his management company. Cormega therefore became one of Nas\' most vocal opponents, releasing a number of underground hip-hop singles dissing Nas, Stoute, and Nature, who was Cormega\'s replacement in The Firm. The Firm\'s The Album was finally released in 1997 to mixed reviews and lackluster sales and the members of the supergroup went their separate ways.\r\n\r\nAt about this time, Nas became a spokesperson for the Willie Esco urban clothing line, but had no other connection with the clothing line. He stopped promoting Willie Esco in 2000, dissatisfied with the company\'s operations. During the same period, Nas co-wrote and starred in Hype Williams\' 1998 feature film Belly, which also featured DMX, Taral Hicks, and T-Boz of TLC among its cast.\r\n\r\n1998–2000: I Am... to Nastradamus\r\n\r\nIn 1998, Nas began work on a double album to be entitled I Am...The Autobiography, which he intended as the middle ground between the extremes of Illmatic and It Was Written. The album was completed in early 1999, and a music video was shot for its lead single, Nas Is Like, produced by DJ Premier and featuring vocal samples from \"It Ain\'t Hard to Tell\". However, much of the LP was leaked in MP3 format onto the Internet, and Nas and Stoute quickly recorded enough substitute material to constitute a single-disc release.\r\n\r\nThe second single for I Am was \"Hate Me Now,\" featuring Sean \"Puffy\" Combs (now \"Diddy\"), was used as an example by Nas\' critics for moving towards commercial themes. Hype Williams shot an allegorical video for the single, which featured Nas and Puffy being crucified in a manner similar to Jesus; After the video was completed, Combs, a Catholic, requested his crucifixion scene be edited out of the video. However, the unedited copy of the \"Hate Me Now\" video made its way to MTV, and was premiered on April 15, 1999 on TRL. A furious Combs and his bodyguards allegedly made their way into Steve Stoute\'s office and assaulted him, at one point apparently hitting Stoute over the head with a champagne bottle. Stoute pressed charges, but he and Combs settled out-of-court that June.\r\n\r\nColumbia had scheduled to release the pirated material from I Am under the title Nastradamus during the latter half of 1999, but, at the last minute, decided Nas should record an entirely new album for release. Nastradamus was therefore rushed to meet a November release date. Though critics were not kind to the album, it did result in a minor hit, the Timbaland-produced \"You Owe Me,\" featuring R&B singer Ginuwine. The only pirated track from I Am... to make it onto Nastradamus was \"Project Windows,\" featuring Ronald Isley. A number of the other bootlegged tracks later made their way onto The Lost Tapes, a collection of underground Nas songs that was released by Columbia in September 2002. The collection saw decent sales and received glowing reviews.\r\n\r\n2000–2001: The Nas vs. Jay-Z rivalry and Stillmatic\r\n\r\nThe highly publicized rivalry between Nas and Jay-Z began as a rivalry between Nas and Jay-Z\'s protege, Memphis Bleek. On his debut album Coming of Age, Bleek made a song entitled \"Memphis Bleek Is\", which was similar in concept to Nas\' single \"Nas is Like\". On the same album, Bleek recorded \"What You Think Of That\" featuring Bleek\'s mentor Jay-Z, which contains the refrain, \"I\'ma ball \'til I fall/what you think of that?\". In retaliation, \"Nastradamus\", the title track from Nas\' second 1999 album, featured a reference to \"What You Think Of That\". The lyrics state, \"You wanna ball till you fall, I can help you with that/You want beef? I could let a slug melt in your hat.\" Memphis Bleek perceived the reference on \"Nastradamus\" as a diss, and therefore dissed Nas on the lead single for his The Understanding LP, My Mind Right\".\r\n\r\nQB\'s Finest was a compilation album that featured Nas and a number of other rappers from Queensbridge, including Mobb Deep, Nature, Littles, The Bravehearts (which included Nas\' younger brother Jungle among its members), and Cormega, who had briefly reconciled with Nas. The album also featured guest appearances from Queensbridge hip-hop legends Roxanne Shante, MC Shan, and Marley Marl. Shan and Marley Marl both appeared on the lead single \"Da Bridge 2001\", which was based on Shan & Marl\'s 1986 recording \"The Bridge\". \"Da Bridge 2001\" also featured a response from Nas to Memphis Bleek, in which Nas called out most of the Roc-A-Fella Records roster, including Bleek, Damon Dash, Beanie Sigel, and Jay-Z.\r\n\r\nJay-Z responded to Nas\' songs with an onstage swipe during the 2001 Hot 97 Summer Jam concert in New York City, when he premiered his song \"Takeover.\" Initially, the song was to only be a Mobb Deep diss, only including one line about Nas near the end. Nevertheless, Nas recorded the \"Stillmatic Freestyle,\" an underground single which sampled Rakim and Eric B.\'s \"Paid in Full\" beat, and attacked Jay-Z and his Roc-A-Fella label. On his 2001 album, The Blueprint, Jay-Z rewrote \"Takeover,\" dedicating half of the song to dissing Nas, claiming that he had a \"...one hot album every ten year average\" record (referring to Illmatic) that his flow was weak, and that he had fabricated his past as a hustler.\r\n\r\nNas responded with \"Ether\", the track begins with gunshots and a repeated, slowed-down sample of Tupac rapping \"Fuck Jay-Z.\" (taken from Tupac\'s \"Fuck Friends\") In \"Ether,\" Nas accuses Jay-Z of stealing (\"biting\") lyrics from The Notorious B.I.G. and brown-nosing Nas and other rappers for fame. Ether was included on Nas\' fifth studio album, Stillmatic, released in December 2001. Stillmatic managed to be not only a critically-acclaimed comeback album, but a commercial success as well, albeit not on the level of It Was Written and I Am...; the album debutted at #7 on the Billboard album charts and featured the singles \"Got Ur Self A...\" and \"One Mic.\" In terms of commercial success, Jay\'s The Blueprint was certified double-platinum, while Stillmatic went platinum.\r\n\r\nJay-Z responded to \"Ether\" with a freestyle entitled \"Supa Ugly.\" going into detail about how he had sex with Carmen Bryan, the mother of Nas\' daughter Destiny. Nas dismissed the track by claiming that he was no longer with Bryan during the time the affair took place. In a recent interview, however, New York radio station Hot 97 settled the battle taking votes comparing \"Ether\" and \"Supa Ugly,\" and Nas won with 58% while Jay-Z got 42% of the votes. By 2005, the two rappers had eventually ended their feud without violence or animosity. During Jay-Z\'s I Declare War - Power House concert, Jay-Z announced to the crowd, \"It\'s bigger than \'I Declare War\'. Let\'s go, Esco!\" Nas then joined Jay-Z onstage, and the two then performed \"Dead Presidents\" together, which Jay-Z had sampled from Nas\' song \"The World is Yours.\"\r\n\r\n2002–Present: From God\'s Son to Street\'s Disciple and beyond\r\n\r\nIn December 2002, Nas released the God\'s Son album. and its lead single, \"Made You Look\". The album debuted at #18 on the Billboard charts despite widespread internet bootlegging. Time Magazine named his album best hip-hop album of the year. Vibe Magazine gave it 4 stars and The Source gave it 4 mics. The second single, the inspirational \"I Can\", which reworked elements from Beethoven\'s \"Fur Elise\", became Nas\' biggest hit to date during the spring and summer of 2003, garnering substantial radio airplay on urban, rhythmic, and top 40 radio stations, as well as on the MTV and VH1 music video networks. God\'s Son also includes several songs dedicated to memory of Nas\' mother, who died of cancer in 2002. In 2003, Nas was featured on the Korn song \"Play Me\", from KoЯn\'s Take a Look in the Mirror LP.\r\n\r\nNas released his seventh studio album, the critically acclaimed double-disc Street\'s Disciple, on November 30, 2004. The album\'s first singles were \"Thief\'s Theme\" and \"Bridging the Gap\", which features his father Olu Dara on vocals. The album also includes \"These are Our Heroes\", which accuses prominent sports stars and actors such as Kobe Bryant, Lenny Henry, Tiger Woods, and Cuba Gooding, Jr. of neglecting their heritage and background in favour of white values. The videos for \"Bridging the Gap\" and \"Just A Moment\" received moderate airplay on MTV and BET. Although the album went platinum, its commercial profile was relatively low compared to the rapper\'s previous releases.\r\n\r\nNas was featured on Kanye West\'s album Late Registration on a song titled \"We Major\". West said the song was Jay-Z\'s favorite on the album, but West was unable to get Jay-Z to record a vocal for the final mix of the song. He also appeared on Damian Marley\'s song \"Road to Zion\" (which also featured newcomer The Game in the video, widening Nas\' still growing universally appreciated raps) and several other songs such as \"Death Anniversary\" and \"It Wasn\'t You\" (featuring Lauryn Hill). In addition, Nas was most recently married to the R&B singer Kelis, who is mostly known for her work internationally, but nonetheless released great hits in the U.S. The couple wed on Jan. 8, 2005 in Atlanta, GA, after a two-year engagement.\r\n\r\nDuring this time, Nas announced that his next album would be entirely self-produced and feature no other rappers, and would be titled Nasir, and later that the project would feature other producers after all and would be called Nasdaq: Dow Jones. Neither of these albums ever materialized.\r\n\r\nAt a free concert in Central Park, New York, Nas made a statement regarding the quality of 50 Cent\'s music. \"this is the real shit, not that 50 Cent shit!\" In response, 50 Cent included a stab at Nas by speaking negatively of his wife Kelis on his single \"Piggy Bank,\" implying that Kelis was promiscuous and calling Nas a \"sucker for love.\" Nas was quoted as saying that he feels no obligation to retaliate, remarking \"[50 has] got a good five to six more albums before I can really respond to him.\" Nas eventually decided to retaliate, and in July 2005 released \"Don\'t Body Ya Self (MC Burial)\", a song which taunts 50 Cent and his G-Unit crew, stating that 50 was \"a sucka for death if I\'m a sucka for love.\" However, despite all of this, Nas still claims to \"have a lot of love towards 50,\" claiming 50 didn\'t understand his moves when they both were together at Columbia Records.\r\n\r\nIn January 2006, Nas signed a label deal with Jay-Z\'s Def Jam, further emphasizing the Jay-Z/Nas truce and raising expectations for a collaboration even higher. His album due in fall of 2006 will come out in a joint deal with this imprint and Columbia Records. He recently announced to MTV News that his album is to be named, \"Hip Hop is Dead...the N,\" the N being a play on the word the \"end.\" The title is supposed to reflect what some would term the current low quality of rap music. The highly anticipated album is due out in December 19th, 2006.\r\n\r\nMusical style and Technique\r\n\r\nNas has long been famed for his creativity and storytelling prowess, which has earned him acclaim from both the hip-hop community and critics. In his early stages, from his first appearance on the Main Source\'s Breaking Atoms and throughout the recording of Illmatic, he was perhaps best known for his street-oriented topics, complex lyrical schemes (which often incorporated multi-syllabic internal rhymes), and witty phrasing and imagery. As he progressed and matured, Nas began to branch out into different subjects and developed a richer voice and slower rapping technique.\r\n\r\nFollowing Illmatic\'s release, Nas developed a penchant for hyper-visual storytelling and topical creativity. For instance, \"Undying Love\" (featured on I Am...) is a tale of his wife\'s betrayal told in first person, \"Rewind\" (featured on Stillmatic) is a narrative in which a story is recited backwards, while on \"I Gave You Power\" (featured on It Was Written), Nas assumes the role of a gun who recounts brutal tales of murder and violence. Over the years Nas\' style has changed significantly. In contrast to his previous work, Nas’ most recent material is distinctively socially aware and often politically inflammatory. Songs such as \"I Can\" (featured on God\'s Son) convey moral messages of black youth empowerment, while \"These Are Our Heroes (Coon Picnic)\" accuses several African-American celebrities of being Uncle Toms. Furthermore, controversial songs such as \"My Country\" and \"A Message to the Feds (Fuck The Police II)\" (which are featured on Stillmatic and Street\'s Disciple, respectively) question the conduct of the American government. Nas\' views in his lyrics throughout his career have made references to Islam and the Five Percent Nation.. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Nas\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The deep-voiced New Orleans artist just started rapping in April 2020, but you wouldn’t know it—already people are calling him “baby Soulja Slim” for his magnetic presence and confidence on the mic. Rob’s pure bars are caked in Louisiana slang and delivered in the kind of gruff, musical cadence you might have heard over Mannie Fresh production 20 years ago, but they’re also refreshingly modern—shot through with the head-spinning velocity of contemporary trap styles.\r\n\r\nBorn in New Orleans in 1999, and growing up at the intersection of projects in the 4th and 9th Wards (that’s where the “49” in his rap handle comes from), Rob had to adapt to the harsh realities of his environment on his own. His parents were in and out of his adolescence serving jail time, and in 2005, when Hurricane Katrina tore through the city, the whole family fled to Houston in Mom’s broken-down Impala. “The windows didn\'t go up. We had no brakes in the car,” Rob remembers vividly. “We was doing 60 on the interstate with the doors open.”\r\n\r\nWhat kept Rob going was his charm and confidence. In school, he was the popular kid, and in stars like Future, Meek Mill, and the Weeknd he saw models for sustained greatness. He also discovered a talent of his own. “I knew I could rap ’cause I used to be listening to Future,” Rob says. “You know how at the end of the song they got a little beat left? I was punishing him!”\r\n\r\nThroughout high school, his peers would discover he could rap, too, but it wasn’t until April of 2020, several months after dropping out of college for nursing, that Rob recorded a song. He stumbled into his friend’s studio session, and at his partner’s behest, stepped inside the booth. “They put a beat on and I just went flashin’! They were like, ‘Yeah this getting played in the car,’”. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Rob49\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

As a young boy, Trip Lee had dreams of being a professional athlete or famous rapper, and he began to hone his lyrical skills at the age of 12. “I rapped about random stuff…how hot I was, how many girls I could pull,” Trip says. But upon giving his life to Christ, at age 14, his focus changed from fortune, fame, and women to serving and ministering the Gospel.\r\n\r\nTrip slowly recognized that all of his life should be centered around Christ. “One day, I just decided, I’m only doing Christian hip hop. Rappers like Ambassador and Da Truth helped provide a model for how I would begin to do that,” he says. He also had an immense desire to learn and teach the Word of God, so he became a leader in his youth group, and preached his first sermon at age 17.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, Trip met Lecrae at a concert; months later, after talking and building with each other, Lecrae began to disciple him. While still in high school, Trip was given the opportunity to pen a few devotionals for the Reach Records website that dealt with theological matters and showcased his spiritual maturity.\r\n\r\nTrip signed with Reach Records, and his debut album, “If They Only Knew,” hit stores nationwide a few days after his high school graduation. His first full-length album introduced hip-hop fans to his distinct southern sound, unique delivery and gospel-saturated lyrics. That same year, Trip was also featured on the Dove Award-nominated, timeless classic “Jesus Muzik” with label mate Lecrae.\r\n\r\nHis sophomore album, “20/20,” was released in 2008 and garnered much success, breaking into the Billboard Top 200 and reaching #11 on the Billboard Christian albums chart and #4 on the Gospel chart. Back with his third studio album, “Between Two Worlds,” Trip offers a collection of reflections on life in a fallen world. True to form, his hope is that his reflections not only resonate with listeners, but also point to Jesus as the Hero.\r\n\r\nSince his first album release, Trip has traveled the world doing concerts for thousands of listeners, and his last three summers have been spent on tours (national and international) with his Reach label mates. His Christ-centered hip-hop message has also built a platform for him among churches and other Christian organizations, which has led to numerous opportunities to preach and teach at conferences and other events.\r\n\r\nTrip now resides in Philadelphia, PA with his wife and is pursuing a degree in Biblical Studies at Philadelphia Biblical University. He is the leader of the small groups ministry at Epiphany Fellowship, where he also preaches and teaches when called upon. Ultimately, his desire is proclaim the grace and beauty of Jesus Christ to anyone that will listen. He hopes that his journey will lead to pastoring a church in the future. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Trip+Lee\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Jones introduced a signature dance move in the \"We Fly High\" video, throwing up a fake jump shot every time the ad-lib \"Ballin!\'\" was stated in the song. This dance move became so popular that it inspired Michael Strahan and Plaxico Burress to do the dance move after big plays during a Monday Night Football game in 2006.[11]\r\n\r\nFrom 2006 to 2008, Jones released a collaborative album with his rap group ByrdGang, titled M.O.B.: The Album, which peaked at number 29 on the Billboard 200, selling 16,000 the first week in stores and eventually selling 65,000 units.

He eventually created his own \"Nostic\" clothing label.[38]\r\n\r\nIn late 2011 Jones was thinking of a new clothing line, and in early 2012 made it official with his brand \"Vampire Life\", co-owned by Dame Dash.[39] The clothing line is sold throughout New York City, and Jones is looking to expand it worldwide.[40]\r\nActing career\r\n\r\nJones made his acting debut in the film State Property 2.He also appeared on the show Crash: The Series.[41] Jones played one of Marlo Stanfield\'s henchmen on Season 5, episode 8 of the critically acclaimed TV drama The Wire on HBO on February 24, 2008. Along with releasing the album Capo, Jones headlined in an off-Broadway musical called Hip-Hop Monologues: Inside the Life and Mind of Jim Jones, produced by Damon Dash and Footage Entertainment.[42]\r\nReality television\r\n\r\nJones also appears in seasons 1 and 2 of the VH1 show Love & Hip Hop: New York (which premiered March 14, 2011 and November 11, 2011, respectively); the show loosely follows events in his personal life and that of his fiancée, Chrissy Lampkin. Jones also stars in season 1 of the VH1 show Chrissy & Mr. Jones; the show follows him and Lampkin, focusing on their personal lives.\r\nSports management\r\n\r\nJones has his own freestyle inline skating team, Dipskate, which he plans to take to the X Games in the near future.[43]\r\n\r\nIn December 2017, he became part owner of the Richmond Roughriders of the American Arena League.[44]\r\nControversies\r\nTru-Life\r\n\r\nAccording to an interview with Tru-Life in the June/July 2006 issue of Complex Magazine, rumors had spread that Tru-Life was referring to Jim Jones in his diss track \"New New York\". Jim Jones reportedly began calling several rappers and telling them that he had a DVD of Tru-Life disrespecting them. Tru-Life responded by calling Dipset bosses Cam\'ron and Jim Jones \"bitches.\"[45]\r\n\r\nJones responded by challenging Tru-Life to a brawl with US$50,000 at stake.[46] Months later, Jones told an interviewer that Tru-Life did not respond to the challenge, does not count in the rap industry, and lacked the money and heart to accept Jones\' challenge.[47]\r\n\r\nThe argument continued into 2007, when Tru-Life released his DJ J-Love hosted mixtape titled Tru York with Dipset disrespect tracks and whose cover superimposes an image of Jim Jones\' face over a swimsuit-clad Borat picture.[48]\r\nJay Z\r\n\r\nJones\' dispute with Tru-Life may have stemmed from a dispute between Cam\'ron and Jay Z, as Tru-Life was signed to Jay Z\'s Roc-La-Familia label at the time. Jim Jones has also criticized Jay Z\'s performance as president of Def Jam Recordings.[49]\r\n\r\nJay Z has since responded with a \"diss\" track called \"Brooklyn High\" over the beat from Jones\' \"We Fly High\".[50] On December 1, 2006, BET\'s Access Granted debuted the video for Jones\' \"We Fly High\" remix, with Diddy, Baby, T.I., Young Dro, and added Juelz Santana\'s verse from his response on the \"We Fly High Beef Mix\".\r\n\r\nOn December 21, 2008, Jones had an altercation with Jay Z\'s ex-associate, Vaughn \"Jayvon\" Smith, at a Louis Vuitton store on Manhattan\'s Fifth Avenue and turned himself in to the police shortly afterward. He pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor assault charge and was sentenced to time served – the few hours he was in custody after turning himself in to police in January. Jones\' defense attorney, Scott Leemon, stated that Jones didn\'t start the fight but pleaded guilty because he did not want to risk probation – and potential touring restrictions – if convicted. Jones still faced a civil suit Smith filed after the incident. MTV reports: Smith is the brother of Tyran \"Ty Ty\" Smith, who works with Ne-Yo and the longtime best friend and colleague of Jones\' lyrical nemesis, Jay Z. In February 2009, Ne-Yo stated on Power 106 radio in Los Angeles that Jones and Smith \"have had drama in the past\".[51][52]\r\n\r\nJayvon was shopping with Ne-Yo when the altercation occurred, and initial reports indicated that Jones\' altercation was with Ne-Yo. However, it was later revealed that Jones did not get into an altercation with Ne-Yo; the false rumor was intended to increase tension.[51][52]\r\n\r\nIn 2017, the two rappers ended their rivalry and Jim Jones signed to Jay-Z\'s Roc Nation.\r\nCam\'ron\r\n\r\nDuring this time, Cam\'ron and Jones were not speaking to each other, leading to speculation that the group had broken up. However, despite admitting that he did not want to contact Jones, Cam\'ron said that he had no hard feelings towards him. In an interview with Miss Info, Cam\'ron said: \"I still haven\'t spoken to Jim. But Jim ran with me for over 10 years, he worked hard, and I wish him the best of luck. Everybody thinks I\'m mad at Jim. Why am I mad? I told people for years that Jimmy was gonna be a star. So it\'s better on my resume. I wish him the best.\"[53] But after three years of not speaking, Cam\'ron and Jim Jones mended their differences in April 2010. In late 2011, both appeared together on Wolfgang Gartner\'s album Weekend in America, on the track \"Circus Freaks\".\r\nASAP Mob\r\n\r\nIn early 2014, Jim Jones criticized ASAP Mob for copying his fashionable style. In an interview with HNHH.com, he explained: \"They weren’t from the street, they’re a good group of kids and they’re artistic, but they’re not from the street and their style is way different than what we do. It’s a little bit far out there for me. We got bonafide swag and the definition of get fly, ya dig? I’m not trying to disrespect them—A$AP Mob is doing it, they got their numbers and they’re doing what they like to do—but they’re nothing like the Diplomats. They didn’t come up hanging and banging and hustling and really touching the pavement, ya dig? It’s a big difference. We don’t wear kilts and we don’t wear tight sweatpants and funny sneakers. That’s not our style. Price point and high fashion don’t really make it cool. I’ll still go in Wal-Mart and come out and niggas will still think it’s Versace.\"[54] Angered by his comments, Juicy J provided additional vocals on ASAP Mob member ASAP Rocky\'s solo single, \"Multiply\", which in the end, took a subliminal shot at Jones. It says: \"Fake ass niggas, you know what I\'m sayin\'? These niggas be out here, talkin\' \'bout they [Jim Jones, Jadakiss and Styles P] them streets niggas and shit, but man... Niggas be gettin\' extorted like a ma\' fucker out here. You know what I\'m sayin\'?[55]\r\n\r\nPreviously, Jones and Rocky linked together for the track, \"Freeze\", which appeared on the ASAP Mob mixtape, 2012\'s Lords Never Worry.[56] Since then, the dispute between the ASAP Mob and Jim Jones seemed to have cooled down after a photo was posted on The Game\'s Instagram account showing the overall three rappers partying in a nightclub.[57]\r\nAzealia Banks\r\nIn July 2012, a social media-related conflict between Jim Jones and rapper Azealia Banks had started after Banks dissed the rapper for getting more credit for her phrase \"Vamp\", as in Jones\' mixtape series and label of the same name, Vampire Life, or his track \"Vamp Life\".[58] Enraged, Banks dissed Jim Jones again via a track titled \"Succubi\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Jim+Jones\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Formerly known as Lil Yo in the 90\'s, he released his first album, From Da Dope Game 2 Da Rap Game, in 2000. Since then he has released 2001\'s Self-Explanatory, 2003\'s Life, 2006\'s Back 2 Da Basics, 2008\'s Cocaine Muzik, 2009\'s CM2 (Cocaine Muzik 2 hosted by DJ Drama), and The Pyrex King: Street Runnaz Special Edition.\r\n\r\nAs one of the six epicenters of Southern hip hop, Memphis has always had a thriving underground capable of producing major platinum superstars such as Eightball & MJG, 3-6 Mafia and Project Pat,Skip a.k.a Gianni Booker. All of the above-mentioned artists at one point in time literally dominated the city’s underground rap scene before going on to become national superstars. Next up to bat is Yo Gotti, M-Town’s current underground rap kingpin. Like his namesake John Gotti, the Memphis based rapper has been running the Southern underground scene with an iron fist for the past. Known and respected throughout the South for his skill and finesse on the microphone, Yo Gotti is one the South’s most respected young rappers.\r\nBorn Mario Mims, Yo Gotti grew up in the infamous Ridge Crest Apartments in a North Memphis neighborhood called Frazier. His childhood was typical for a poor ghetto youth in the Deep South. Raised in a family of hustlers and exposed to hard times 24 hours a day the Tennessee rap titan soon turned to the only thing that he knew could get him paid, hustling. “Being from the hood things like hustling will come your way,” says Yo Gotti. “Everybody in my family hustled in some kinda way.” Ironically, hustling is what ultimately led Yo Gotti to rapping.\r\nTaking his cue from Memphis rap legends such as Eightball & MJG, Al Kapone, Gangsta Black, Triple 6 Mafia and Kingpin Skinny Pimp, all of whom he lists as influences, Yo Gotti released his own underground tape entitled, Youngster on the Come Up and placed it on consignment at local mom & pop record stores as well as hustling it out the trunk. The tape sold like hotcakes on the street and made Yo Gotti the hottest rapper on the streets of Memphis. From the Dope Game to the Rap Game, Yo Gotti’s sophomore effort sold so well that Select-O-Hits, a local based independent distributor offered him a small deal and the Memphis rapper more than doubled his fan base with absolutely no marketing or promotions. Soon he found himself ranked among the city’s top rappers. In addition to being featured on the cover of Murderdog Magazine along side his idols Kingpin Skinny Pimp and Al Kapone his record From the Dope Game to the Rap Game made the list for the magazine’s top independent record for the year 2000.\r\nTwo years later he inked a distribution deal with TVT Records and released the critically acclaimed album Life, which did respectable numbers for an independent label. “It sold about 40 or 50,000, with no promotions or video,” says Yo Gotti. “That record did what it did on its own.” But as the old saying goes when one door is closed another opened. Gotti’s reputation as the king of Memphis continued to spread and that eventually led him to a production deal with Cash Money/Universal records for his group the Block Burnaz. With his TVT sophomore album entitled Back 2 Da Basics, Yo Gotti returns with the same hardcore street flavor that his die-hard fans have come to know and love, only this time around the true king of Memphis has elevated his game a bit. Given the fact that his last record didn’t do the type of big number he’d hope for you’d think that Yo Gotti would switch up his style to reach a larger audience. Right? Wrong! According to Gotti his street credibility with his underground fans means more to him than gold or platinum status.\r\n“The one thing that you have to understand is that when you create a fan base off of street product the last thing you wanna do is disrespect them by changing because of the record companies and stuff like that. When you do that you change what created you. To me it is very important that I keep in tune with the people that helped to sell 40,000 records independently. That’s why I call my record Back 2 Da Basics.”\r\nProduced by DJ Thoomp, Mannie Fresh, Carlos Brody and newcomers Street Tunes, Back 2 Da Basics offers fans a gritty, insider’s view into the real streets of Memphis as seen through the eyes of Yo Gotti. Nowhere is this viewpoint more intense than on “Full Time,” the amped up lead single –and featured in the MTV Films’ Hustle & Flow movie - with a thunderous bass and intoxicating beat that espouses Gotti’s formula to success –hustle full time.\r\n“A lotta cats wanna be a rapper or a street hustler but they don’t wanna put in the time that it takes,” says Yo Gotti. “They want the money and the cars and the girls, but they don’t wanna work hard for it. But to be successful at anything you gotta grind for it.” On the song “Mama We Gone Be Alright,” he waxes introspective by reflecting on all of the hard times that he and his family have suffered through the years and offers her hope-filled words encouragement. “Mama We Gone Be Alright” along with the gripping tune “My Story” emerges as two of the most interesting songs on Back 2 Da Basics. These three titles along with club banging songs like “Shorty” featuring Baby make Back 2 Da Basics one of the best albums of the year. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Yo+Gotti\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

His mother Sabrina, a drug dealer, died in a fire when he was 8. Since his father had already abandoned the family, young Curtis was sent to live with his grandparents. Growing up during the crack epidemic of the 80s and 90s, Jackson dealt drugs when he wasn\'t \"killing time\" at school or boxing at a local gym. His grandparents assumed he was at after-school programs when he was out selling crack. In tenth grade, Jackson was caught with guns and drug money passing through the metal detectors at Andrew Jackson High School in Queens. In 1994, Jackson was arrested again for selling vials of cocaine to an undercover officer, and three weeks later he was arrested yet-again after police found heroin, crack cocaine, and a starter pistol in his home.

Around this time, Jackson began going by \"50 Cent,\" inspired by deceased Brooklyn stick-up man Kelvin \"50 Cent\" Martin. \r\n\r\nAfter leaving drug dealing to pursue a rap career, he released his debut album Guess Who\'s Back Again in 2002. He was discovered by Eminem and Dr. Dre and then signed to Interscope Records. He has since released Get Rich or Die Tryin\' (2003), The Massacre (2006), Curtis (2007) and Before I Self Destruct (2009).\r\n\r\n50 Cent has engaged in feuds with other rappers including Jay-Z, Ja Rule, The Game, Cam\'ron, Fat Joe, and Rick Ross. He has also pursued an acting career, appearing in the semi-autobiographical film Get Rich or Die Tryin\' in 2005, the Iraq War film Home of the Brave in 2006, and Righteous Kill in 2008. 50 Cent is one of the richest hip-hop performers, having a net worth estimated at US $440 million in 2008.\r\n\r\nBefore 50 Cent ever inked a major deal, he built up a substantial fan base in New York through underground mixtapes. 50 Cent met up with Jam Master Jay of Run-DMC and was signed to his label to write all of Jay’s music. After he’d left JMJ, he signed to Columbia Records in 1996. On this label, he released Power of the Dollar, and the singles How to Rob and Ghetto Qua Ran. Columbia Records released him from the label after being shot on May 24th, 2000.\r\n\r\nAround this time, Eminem had heard one of 50 Cent’s demo tapes and expressed a huge interest in him on MTV, as did Dr. Dre. Shortly after this, 50 Cent officially signed to Interscope Records. He was the first rapper to sign to the joint label owned by Dr. Dre and Eminem. The first song he released on this record was entitled Wanksta and was featured on the 8 Mile soundtrack.\r\n\r\nIn its first week of release, his debut ”Get Rich Or Die Tryin’” sold 872,000 units - easily reaching Gold status. Within the second week it went Platinum (1 mil) and on April 12th, 2004 the RIAA certified it six times Platinum.\r\n\r\nIn 2005 he followed the success of his album Get Rich or Die Tryin’ with a new release - The Massacre (originally called St. Valentines Day Massacre until the release date was pushed back). The first single released off this, Disco Inferno, was a huge hit - he followed this hit up by the release of Candy Shop and then again with Just a Lil Bit.\r\n\r\nIn 2003 Interscope Records allowed 50 Cent to have his own label - G-Unit Records. He first signed Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo and Young Buck as the established members of G-Unit Records. In 2004, Dr. Dre and 50 Cent had signed The Game under a joint venture. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/50+Cent\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
